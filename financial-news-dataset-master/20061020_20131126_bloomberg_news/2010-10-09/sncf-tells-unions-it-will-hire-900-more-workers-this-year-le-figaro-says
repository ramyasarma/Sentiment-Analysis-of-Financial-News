Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Francais, the state-owned rail operator, will hire an extra 900
people by the end of the year after more workers retired than
the company had expected, the French daily Le Figaro said,
citing Francois Nogue, the company’s head of human resources.  The announcement was made yesterday to SNCF unions, the
newspaper said. French railworker unions are scheduled to begin
open-ended strikes on Oct. 12 if President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
refuses to scrap plans to raise the retirement age by two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
