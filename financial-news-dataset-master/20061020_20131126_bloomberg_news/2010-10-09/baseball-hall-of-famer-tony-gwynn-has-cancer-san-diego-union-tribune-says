Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn has
cancer in a salivary gland, the San Diego Union-Tribune said on
its website.  Gwynn told the newspaper the cancer was discovered last
month after a third round of surgery since 1997 to remove a
tumor on the parolid gland. Doctors told him “they feel they
caught the cancer early and there was not much of it there,”
according to the newspaper.  Gwynn, 50, played for the San Diego Padres from 1982 to
2001, winning eight National League batting titles. He was
elected to the Hall of Fame in 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
