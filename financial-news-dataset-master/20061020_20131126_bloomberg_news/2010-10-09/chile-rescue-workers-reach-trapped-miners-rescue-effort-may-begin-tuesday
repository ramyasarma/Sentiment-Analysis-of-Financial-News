The rescue of 33 Chilean miners
trapped since Aug. 5 may begin on Oct. 12  after workers drilled
to the chamber where the miners were isolated about a half-mile
below the surface.  A siren at Cia. Minera San Esteban Primera SA’s San Jose
copper and gold mine in Chile’s northern Atacama region alerted
relatives of the drilling’s success.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
