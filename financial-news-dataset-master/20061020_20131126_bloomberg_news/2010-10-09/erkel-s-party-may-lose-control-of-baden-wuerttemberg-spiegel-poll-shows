German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Christian Democrats may lose control of the country’s third-most
populous state for the first time in almost 60 years, according
to a poll published in  Der Spiegel  magazine.  No more than 34 percent of voters in Baden-Wuerttemberg,
home to carmakers  Daimler AG  and  Porsche SE , would vote for the
Christian Democrats, known as the CDU, if elections were held
now, the magazine said, citing a survey of 1,002 people
conducted by TNS Forschung last week.  Thirty-two percent of respondents would vote for the
opposition Green Party, while the Social Democrats would garner
19 percent support and the Left Party receive 5 percent, the
magazine reported. The Free Democrats, junior partner in the
state’s ruling coalition, scored 6 percent, according to Der
Spiegel. No margin of error was given.  The southwestern German state has seen weeks of public
protests in the regional capital of Stuttgart against a planned
demolition of the city’s main train station as part of the so-
called Stuttgart 21 high-speed rail project. Baden-Wuerttemberg,
which has been ruled by CDU-led governments since 1953, will
hold state elections on March 27, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
