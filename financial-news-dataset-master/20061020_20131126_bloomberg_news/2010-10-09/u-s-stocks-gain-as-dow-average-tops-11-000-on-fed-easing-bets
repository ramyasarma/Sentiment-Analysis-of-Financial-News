U.S. stocks  advanced this week,
sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 11,000 for the
first time since before the May 6 crash, on speculation the
Federal Reserve will buy more debt to boost the economy.  Alcoa Inc. gained 5.4 percent after  third-quarter earnings 
topped analysts’ estimates. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.
rose at least 2.4 percent as  commodity producers  rallied on bets
the Fed will increase asset purchases to pump more cash into the
economy. J.C. Penney Co. jumped 18 percent, the most in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, after  William Ackman ’s hedge fund
announced it had bought a stake.  The S&P 500 advanced 1.7 percent to 1,165.15 this week.  The
Dow  rose 176.80 points, or 1.6 percent, to 11,006.48. Both
measures closed at the highest levels since May yesterday after
the economy lost more jobs than forecast last month, bolstering
speculation the central bank will attempt to stoke growth.  “The key driver has been the prospects of quantitative
easing,” said  Komal Sri-Kumar , the Los Angeles-based chief
global strategist at TCW Group Inc. who helps oversee about $109
billion. “The markets think there could be the increase in
money supply coming from the Fed’s renewed purchases of
Treasuries. It’s a green signal for investors to take on more
risk.”  More than 40 stocks in the S&P 500 rose to 52-week highs
yesterday after the Labor Department said American payrolls fell
by 95,000 workers in September, 19 times the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said on Oct. 4 that the central bank’s first round of large-
scale asset purchases aided the economy and that further buying
is likely to help more.  Aluminum  Alcoa jumped 5.4 percent to $12.89 for the biggest increase
in the Dow this week. The largest U.S. aluminum producer
reported third-quarter earnings excluding certain items of 9
cents a share, beating the 5-cent  average estimate  of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Material stocks advanced 3.2 percent, the biggest gain out
of 10 industries in the S&P 500. Gold climbed for the fourth
straight week, while copper rose to a 27-month high. Exxon Mobil
Corp. and Chevron Corp. climbed as much as 2.9 percent as crude
oil rallied for the third straight week.  J.C. Penney surged 18 percent to $32.49, the biggest gain
in the S&P 500. Pershing Square Capital Management LP, the New
York hedge-fund firm led by  William Ackman , disclosed a 16.5
percent stake in J.C. Penney, making it the retailer’s  largest
investor . The third-biggest department-store chain in the U.S.
also reported that comparable-store sales climbed 5.1 percent,
exceeding analysts’ projections.  Wind Turbines  General Electric Co. rose 4.7 percent to $17.12 as
industrial stocks rallied 2.9 percent. The world’s second-
biggest maker of wind turbines agreed to buy oilfield equipment
maker Dresser Inc. for $3 billion.  “When the markets are rallying, the cyclicals tend to do
well,” said  John Praveen , the Newark, New Jersey-based chief
investment strategist at Prudential International Investments
Advisers LLC, which oversees $690 billion. “It’s a liquidity
driven market. Quantitative easing by the Fed will provide lots
of liquidity into the economy that can find its way into the
equity market.”  The S&P 500 Index rallied 8.8 percent last month to erase
its 2010 loss. The benchmark for U.S. stocks may surge 13
percent through the end of January, according to Bank of America
Corp.  Strong Finish  “A strong September is usually a prelude to strong year-
end finish,” according to  David Bianco , the New York-based head
of U.S. equity strategy at Bank of America. During “heightened
economic and political uncertainty,” the average return from
Sept. 30 to Jan. 31 is 13 percent, he wrote in a Oct. 1 note.  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. gained 14 percent to $42.87. The
teen clothing retailer said sales at stores open at least a year
rose 13 percent, beating the 3.6 percent average of analysts’
estimates compiled by Retail Metrics Inc. Consumer discretionary
companies gained 2.6 percent.  Adobe Systems Inc. climbed 2.7 percent to $26.99 after
surging 12 percent on Oct. 7. Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Ballmer  met with Adobe CEO  Shantanu Narayen  to
discuss a closer collaboration, according to the New York Times.
Shares of Adobe pared the weekly gain yesterday after the Wall
Street Journal reported speculation the maker of graphic
software may be acquired by Microsoft is “nonsense.”  American Express Co. sank 9.1 percent to $37.99, the  worst
performer  of the 30 companies in the Dow. The New York-based
credit-card issuer chose to challenge a U.S. antitrust complaint
while larger rivals Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. settled the
case, no longer barring merchants from steering customers to
alternative forms of payment.  The benchmark index for U.S. stock  options  ended the week
at the lowest level since May 3. The  VIX , as the  Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index  is known, fell the most in
five weeks, dropping 8 percent to 20.71. The index, which
measures the cost of using options to protect against  S&P 500 
declines, has fallen 55 percent since this year’s peak in May
and is near its 20.41 average over its  two-decade history .  To contact the reporter on this story:
