Best Buy Co. , the world’s largest
consumer-electronics retailer, sued  AU Optronics Corp.  and at
least nine other liquid crystal display manufacturers over
antitrust claims.  From 1996 to 2006, the makers of displays used in
computers, televisions and mobile phones, agreed on what prices
and volumes each would produce, according to the complaint filed
today in federal court in San Francisco. Other manufacturers
named in the suit include Nagano, Japan-based Seiko Epson Corp.,
Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. and Seoul-based  LG Display Co.   Best Buy, based in Richfield, Minnesota, bought and stored
in the U.S. “substantial volumes” of products containing
liquid crystal displays, according to the complaint.  The price fixing “directly caused a domestic and foreign
antitrust injury by reducing the demand for such products and
thereby reducing the domestic and foreign purchases and sales,”
Best Buy said.  AU Optronics  is Taiwan’s second-largest flat-panel maker.
Yawen Hsiao, an AU Optronics spokeswoman, declined to
immediately comment.  The case is Best Buy Co. Inc. v. AU Optronics Corp.,
10-04572, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
