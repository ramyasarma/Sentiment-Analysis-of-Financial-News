Kuwait’s sovereign wealth fund did
not receive an offer for its stake in Mobile Telecommunications
Co., known as Zain, Managing Director Bader al-Saad said in
remarks to Al Arabiya television aired today.  Al-Saad said the fund supports the possible deal in which
Emirates Telecommunications Corp., known as Estisalt, offered to
buy 46% of Zain and said the deal would be a boost to the
Kuwaiti stock market. He declined to comment on the price
offered by Etisalat. The fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority,
holds 24.6 percent in Zain according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
