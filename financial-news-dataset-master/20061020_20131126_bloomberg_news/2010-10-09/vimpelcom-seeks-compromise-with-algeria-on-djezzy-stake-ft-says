VimpelCom Ltd.  is “happy” to sell
Algeria’s largest mobile-phone company for $7.8 billion and will
pursue legal action if the Algerian government won’t pay a fair
price, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview with
the Russian company’s chief executive officer.  Alexander Izosimov  told the newspaper he would prefer to
own Orascom Telecom Holding SAE’s Djezzy unit, though a
compromise is possible under which Algeria would own a stake in
Djezzy and VimpelCom would run it.  Going to court would be a “last resort,” Izosimov said in
comments confirmed by  Elena Prokhorova , a spokeswoman for
VimpelCom.  To contact the reporters on this story: Catherine Airlie at
