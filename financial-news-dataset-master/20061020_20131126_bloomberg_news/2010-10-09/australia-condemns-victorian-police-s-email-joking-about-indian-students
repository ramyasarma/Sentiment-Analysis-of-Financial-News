Australia condemned an email
circulated by two members of the Victorian Police that joked
about Indian students.  The email made fun about the electrocution of an Indian
train passenger and suggested that it could be a way to fix the
Indian student problem in Melbourne, the Press Trust of India
reported.  Australia’s High Commissioner to India, Peter Varghese,
described the email as “offensive” and “unacceptable” and
contrary to the principles of respect and tolerance which
underpinned the Australian society, according to an emailed
statement.  Attacks on Indian students in Australia dominated headlines
in May and June last year, prompting federal and state
Australian ministers to travel to New Delhi in an effort to ease
concerns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
