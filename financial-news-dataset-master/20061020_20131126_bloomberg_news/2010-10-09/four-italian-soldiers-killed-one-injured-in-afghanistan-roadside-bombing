Four Italian soldiers were killed and
one was seriously injured in Afghanistan today when a bomb blew
up their vehicle, Italian Minister of Defence  Ignazio La Russa 
said.  The soldiers were attacked near Farah in western
Afghanistan while escorting a convoy of civilian trucks, the
 minister  said in an e-mailed statement.  Terrorists threatening Europe come from these regions,
Italy’s Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini  said in an e-mailed
statement today. “We are committed to accelerate the transition
phase which will give Afghan soldiers the responsibility to
control their country,” he said.  Today’s blast brings to 34 the number of Italian soldiers
who have died in Afghanistan since 2004. Italy will have 4,000
troops in the country by the end of the year, up from 3,500,
Undersecretary Maurizio Crosetto said on the Ministry of Defence
website Sept. 23. The number will be reduced starting next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
