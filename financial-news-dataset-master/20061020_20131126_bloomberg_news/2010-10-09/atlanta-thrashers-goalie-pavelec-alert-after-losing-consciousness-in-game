Atlanta Thrashers goalie  Ondrej Pavelec  was kept overnight in a hospital for further tests
after being taken off the ice on a stretcher during the
National Hockey League team’s season opener.  Pavelec, 23, was awake and alert after losing
consciousness and falling to the ice 2:25 into the first
period of the team’s 4-2 win over the Washington Capitals
in Atlanta, the team said. Pavelec went down while the play
was at the other end of Philips Arena. No Thrashers players
or coaches saw him collapse.  “We didn’t know what was going on,” Thrashers
defenseman  Zach Bogosian  said. “It was definitely scary.
We’re just glad he’s OK.”  After play was stopped last night, Pavelec lay
motionless on his back for about 15 minutes before being
placed on a backboard by the team’s medical personnel and
wheeled off the ice on a stretcher and taken to the
hospital.  Thrashers president  Don Waddell  said Pavelec will
undergo additional tests to determine why he collapsed.  “That’s the biggest thing,” Waddell said. “You want
to find out why it happened.”  Pavelec was replaced in the game by  Chris Mason , who
stopped 29 shots for the victory.  Evander Kane  led Atlanta with two goals, including one
on a second-period penalty shot.  Andrew Ladd  and  Fredrik Modin  also scored for the Thrashers, while  Brooks Laich  and
 Mike Knuble  had goals for Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
