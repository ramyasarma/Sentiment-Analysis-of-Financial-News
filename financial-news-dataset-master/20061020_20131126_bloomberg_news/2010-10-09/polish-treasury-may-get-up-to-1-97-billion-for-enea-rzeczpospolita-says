Poland may raise as much as 5.6
billion zloty ($1.97 billion) from the sale of a 51 percent
stake in  Enea SA , the country’s third-largest utility,
 Rzeczpospolita  reported, without citing anyone.  The Treasury Ministry received four bids, valuing the stake
at between 5.2 billion zloty and 5.6 billion zloty, the daily
said. The highest price of 25 zloty a share was offered by
Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday.  Deputy Treasury Minister  Jan Bury  told the newspaper that
all offers “are serious and at a very good level.”  Separately, he added that the government expects to sell
this year 50 percent of power plant Zespol Elektrowni Patnow
Adamow Konin SA as well as 85 percent of two coal mines Konin
and Adamow, which supply coal to the utility. The total price
that the government receives is more than 1 billion zloty, said
Rzeczpospolita, without saying where it obtained the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
