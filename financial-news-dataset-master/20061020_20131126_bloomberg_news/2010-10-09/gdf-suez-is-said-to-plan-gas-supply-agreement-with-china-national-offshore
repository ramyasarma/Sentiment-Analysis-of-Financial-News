GDF Suez SA signed an agreement to
supply 2.6 million tons of natural gas to China National
Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) over four years starting from 2013,
Chairman Gerard Mestrallet said in Shanghai.  “China will become an extremely important actor in terms
of LNG development in next decade,” Mestrellet told reporters.
“China is a core market to us.”  The deal is worth more than $1 billion, Wang Jiaxiang,
assistant president of CNOOC told reporters, adding that a
medium-term contract can help the company to diversify its
supply sources and avoid risks.  GDF is in talks with Pakistan on natural gas supply,
Mestrallet said, without giving details. GDF aim to increase
cooperation with Chinese companies in energy sectors such as
water, power and energy efficiency, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
