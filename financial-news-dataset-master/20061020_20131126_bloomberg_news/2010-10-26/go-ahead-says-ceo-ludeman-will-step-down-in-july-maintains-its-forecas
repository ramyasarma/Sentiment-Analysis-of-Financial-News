Go-Ahead Group Plc , the biggest
operator of London buses, said Chief Executive  Keith Ludeman  is
retiring next year and it is maintaining its full-year forecast.  Ludeman will retire in July and will be replaced by David
Brown, who will join Go-Ahead as deputy chief executive on April
1, the Newcastle upon Tyne, England-based company said in a
Regulatory News Service statement today.  Trading has been “robust” in the period from July 4 to
Oct. 25, the company said in a separate statement. U.K.
government spending cuts “should have no direct impact on the
group in the current financial year” the company said. Last
week, Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said he would
leave the bulk of fuel subsidies for bus companies intact.  “Even in the current economic climate, we continue to see
growth in patronage in our rail and bus operations,” Ludeman
said in the statement. “Tough but effective cost control,
combined with sensible acquisitions and a sharp focus on
delivering the high-quality services our passengers need and
deserve, mean we are well placed to meet the challenges ahead.”  Go-Ahead is diversifying its operations to reduce reliance
on the U.K. The company said today it is looking for
opportunities to “gradually” grow its school bus operations in
the U.S. In London, comparable regulated bus mileage for the
period was 1 percent more than the same period a year earlier.
Outside London bus revenue rose 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
