Senegal is selling 75 billion CFA
francs ($158 million) of five-year bonds, Finance Ministry
spokesman Ousmane Gueye said.  Gueye spoke in a phone interview today from Dakar, the
capital, and didn’t provide further information.  The bonds will pay a coupon of 6.75 percent and the
proceeds of the sale will be used to help finance
infrastructure-related projects,  Standard Bank Group Ltd. ,
Africa’s biggest lender, said in an e-mailed note today.  Senegal began selling the securities last week and will
close the offer on Nov. 15, after which the bonds will be listed
on a regional exchange located in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, known as
the Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres, Standard Bank said
in the note. The country is rated B+ by Standard & Poor’s, the
fourth-highest non-investment grade rating used by the company
to help assess creditworthiness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
