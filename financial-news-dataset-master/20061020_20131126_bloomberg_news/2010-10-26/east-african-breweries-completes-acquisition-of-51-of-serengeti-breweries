Diageo Plc’s Kenyan unit, East
African Breweries Ltd., completed its acquisition of 51 percent
of Serengeti Breweries Ltd. of Tanzania.  The deal cost $60.4 million, Company Secretary Agnes Murgor
said today in a statement published in the Nairobi-based Daily
Nation.  “Serengeti Breweries Ltd. will form an integral part of
EABL’s east African supply footprint providing additional
capacity to Kenya and Uganda,” Murgor said.  Shareholders of EABL, as the company is known, approved the
acquisition during an extraordinary general meeting in Nairobi
on Oct. 21.  Tanzania’s antitrust regulator said July 30 it had granted
conditional approval for the purchase of 51 percent of
Serengeti. EABL must sell its 20 percent stake in rival Tanzania  Breweries Ltd. before the purchase is completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
