Poland’s government approved plans
to cut jobs and limit the growth of discretionary spending as it
seeks to narrow the  budget deficit  and lower public debt.  The cabinet plans to reduce employment at state agencies
and funds by 10 percent next year and “maintain a limited
workforce level” through 2013, according to an e-mailed
statement released late yesterday in Warsaw. The government also
capped discretionary spending increases at 1 percentage point
more than  consumer-price  inflation.  “The purpose is to lower public debt as well as the cost of
its repayment,” the Cabinet said. The measures will help cut the
budget deficit to the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross
domestic product, allowing Poland to adopt the euro at some
point in the future, it said.  Poland said last week its general government deficit will
widen to 7.9 percent of GDP this year from 7.2 percent in 2009.
Public  debt  will rise to 55.4 percent of GDP this year from 50.9
percent at the end of 2009, the Finance Ministry said Oct. 22.  Breaching 55 percent would trigger rules that force the
government to narrow the gap within two years by raising taxes
and cutting spending. The Constitution requires public debt to
stay below 60 percent of GDP.  Savings from the cap on discretionary spending will equal
2.8 billion zloty ($990 million) next year, 8.5 billion zloty in
2012, 17.4 billion zloty in 2013 and 29.5 billion zloty in 2014,
the government estimated. Discretionary expenditure accounts for
about a quarter of budget spending.  In addition to the job cuts and spending cap, Poland plans
to trim borrowing needs through cash pooling, either in the form
of deposits or asset management by Finance Ministry, the cabinet
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
