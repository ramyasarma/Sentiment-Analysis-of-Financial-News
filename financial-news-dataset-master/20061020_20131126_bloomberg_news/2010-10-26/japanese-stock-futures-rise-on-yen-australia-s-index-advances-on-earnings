Japanese  stock   futures  rose as the
yen weakened from a 15-year high against the dollar, easing
concern that export earnings will fall, while higher earnings
boosted Australia’s benchmark index.  American depositary receipts of Sony Corp., a Japanese
electronics maker that derives about 70 percent of its revenue
abroad, climbed 0.7 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than
80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, gained 0.9 percent.
National Australia Bank Ltd., the nation’s biggest business
lender, advanced 2.2 percent in Sydney after it returned to
profit in the January-to-July period.  “Since the yen halted its appreciation against the dollar,
exporters will likely advance,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an
equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.
“Investors still want to see the results of corporate earnings,
which will increase toward the end of this week, so buying
momentum will be limited.”  Oct. 29 is the  peak day  for earnings reports in Japan, with
272 of the 1,662 companies in the Topix scheduled to report
results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nine companies
in Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index are due to report this week.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,430 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,360 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,420 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.4 percent in Wellington.  Earnings, Confidence  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index was little changed yesterday in New
York, while most stocks declined. Consumer-staples companies
dropped as results that disappointed investors at companies from
Kimberly-Clark Corp. to U.S. Steel Corp. overshadowed higher-
than-estimated consumer confidence.  The New York-based Conference Board’s confidence index
increased to 50.2 in October, exceeding the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey, from a revised 48.6 in September, the
organization said yesterday.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 8.3 percent in
2010, compared with gains of 6.3 percent by the S&P 500 and 5.1
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at an average of 14.2 times estimated
 earnings , compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.3
times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 81.66 against the dollar about 3 a.m.
in Tokyo, compared with 80.68 at yesterday’s close of stock
trading. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Yen, Mitsubishi  The yen appreciated to 80.41 against the dollar on Oct. 25,
the highest level since April 1995. It is headed for its
strongest annual average level since currencies began trading
freely in 1971, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
based on each day’s closing price.  Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest commodities trader, may
say net income climbed 89 percent to 260 billion yen ($3.19
billion) in the April-to-September half because of energy and
mineral operations, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without
saying where it got the information. For the year ending March
2011, Mitsubishi may boost its profit forecast, Nikkei said.  National Australia Bank reported net income of A$2.13
billion ($2.1 billion) in the January-to-July half, compared
with a year-earlier net loss, as business banking rebounded and
bad debts fell.  To contact the reporters for this story:
