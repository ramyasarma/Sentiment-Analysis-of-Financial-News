The dollar rose for the first time
in three days against the euro on speculation the Federal
Reserve will succeed in fueling inflation with more government
bond purchases, supporting the U.S. economic recovery.  The greenback gained versus 14 of its 16 major counterparts
after the Treasury sold $10 billion of five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities at a negative yield for the first
time at a U.S. debt auction. A negative yield suggests investors
are betting the Fed will be successful in preventing deflation.
The pound was near its weakest in more than six months against
the euro before a report likely to show U.K.  economic growth 
slowed to a third of the pace in the previous three months.  “More quantitative easing by the Fed could be positive for
the greenback should it cause inflation,” said Lee Wai Tuck, a
currency strategist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “This may
encourage investors to purchase dollar-denominated assets.”  The dollar climbed to $1.3925 per euro at 9:01 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3965 in New York yesterday. The U.S. currency was
at 80.82 yen from 80.81 yen yesterday, when it declined to 80.40
yen, the lowest level since April 1995. The euro slipped to
112.55 yen from 112.85 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
