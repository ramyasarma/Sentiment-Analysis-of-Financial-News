TNK-BP International Ltd., BP Plc’s
venture with Russian billionaires, said profit rose 25 percent
in the third quarter from the previous three months after
selling inventories and benefiting from a weaker ruble.  Net income rose to $1.45 billion from $1.16 billion in the
second quarter, the Moscow-based company said in a statement
today. Compared with the third quarter of last year, net fell 14
percent from $1.68 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on information on TNK-BP’s  website .  Sales rose 8.4 percent to $11.4 billion from the second
quarter, Russia’s third-largest oil producer said. TNK-BP sold
about 1.2 million metric tons of oil and products in the period
that had been produced in the second quarter, according to the
company.  The Russian currency weakened 0.9 percent in the quarter to
average 30.6 rubles to the dollar, benefiting exporters with
dollar-denominated revenue and ruble costs.  TNK-BP cut net debt about 26 percent to $4.29 billion as of
Sept. 30 from $5.82 billion at the end of June, the company
said. The company plans to take $1 billion from a credit
facility in November, with no immediate plans to take the
remaining $1 billion, Chief Financial Officer  Jonathan Muir  told
reporters in Moscow.  Small Acquisitions, BP Stakes  TNK-BP is looking at small acquisitions in retail and
natural-gas projects, Muir said. The venture agreed to buy BP’s
stakes in some Venezuelan and Vietnamese projects for $1.8
billion on Oct. 18. BP’s partners in Vietnam have two months to
decide on exercising their right of first refusal, Muir said.  The venture plans to reduce capital expenditures to $4
billion this year from an earlier planned $4.4 billion, because
of lower ruble costs and delays at a Siberian project after
failing to agree on access to an oil pipeline controlled by OAO
Rosneft, Muir said.  Crude output was little changed at 1.53 million barrels a
day, while gas output fell 16 percent to 182,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day, TNK-BP said. Prices for Russia’s  Urals blend 
crude exports fell 1.7 percent to average $75.60 a barrel in the
quarter from the previous three-month period, TNK-BP said.  TNK-BP International controls about 95 percent of  OAO TNK-
BP Holding , its Moscow-traded entity, and additional assets,
including almost 50 percent of OAO Slavneft, a venture with  OAO
Gazprom  Neft, and the Linik refinery in Ukraine.  TNK-BP said its ZAO Rospan International gas production
unit agreed in September on gaining access to OAO Gazprom’s
pipeline network for 6 years with volumes reaching 13.2 billion
cubic meters a year in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
