Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.  rose in
New York trading after the world’s second-largest cruise
operator raised its 2010 profit forecast and predicted record
earnings next year, helped by cost controls and new ships.  The shares jumped $4.65, or 13 percent, to $39.80 at 10:36
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
touching $39.90, the highest price since Feb. 14, 2008. They had
advanced 39 percent this year before today.  Annual earnings will be increased to $2.43 to $2.47 a
share, compared with the July forecast of $2.25 to $2.35, the
Miami-based company said in a statement today. Royal Caribbean
said it expects 2011 earnings to exceed its previous record of
$3.26 a share.  Passenger bookings are recovering since Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Fain  slashed ticket prices and costs last year
to attract bargain-seeking vacationers. Demand is now “steady
and solid,” Fain said today in the statement.  “Profitability momentum moving into 2011 is also quite
strong with our newest vessels performing exceptionally well and
our management team controlling costs very effectively,” Fain
said. “The economy is still tough, but even facing such
headwinds our outlook is remarkably encouraging.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
