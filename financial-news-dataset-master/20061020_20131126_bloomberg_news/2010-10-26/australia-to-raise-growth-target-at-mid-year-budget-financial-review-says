Australia is poised to raise its
economic growth and employment forecasts at its mid-year budget
update due by Christmas, from the current expectation of 3
percent growth and 5 percent unemployment, the Australian
Financial Review reported, citing comments by Treasurer Wayne
Swan to his colleagues. Swan warned the rising Australian dollar
might have an adverse impact on tax revenues, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
