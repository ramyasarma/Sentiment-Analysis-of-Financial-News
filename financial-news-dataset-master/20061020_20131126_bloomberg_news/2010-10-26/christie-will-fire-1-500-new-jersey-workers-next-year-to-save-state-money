New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie ,
a Republican who took office this year pledging to end chronic
deficits without raising taxes, said he plans to fire 1,500
state workers starting in January.  Christie’s predecessor, Democrat  Jon Corzine , included a
“no-layoff” clause protecting employees until Jan. 1 as part
of an 18-month wage freeze negotiated with unions. Christie, who
closed an $11 billion deficit through spending curbs, has called
that agreement “exquisite handcuffs.”  “The only way to save money in the budget over the long
run, or the best way, is to get rid of personnel,” Christie
said today at a town-hall meeting in South Brunswick. “We’re
going to be getting more aggressive about that.”  Christie first proposed firing as many as 1,300 workers in
his spending plan for the year that began July 1. He declined
today to specify which departments would be included in the
plan. New Jersey’s payroll is about 70,000, according to the
state Treasury.  The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services has
projected a deficit that may be as much as $10.5 billion next
fiscal year, which Christie said is too high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
