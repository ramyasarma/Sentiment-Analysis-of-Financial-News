The cost of electricity from solar-
thermal plants may fall 30 percent by 2015 as improved machinery
heats steam to increasingly higher temperatures, Abengoa SA
executive Michael Geyer said.  Plants that use mirrors for concentrating sunlight will be
able to handle steam for power turbines as hot as 500 degrees
Celsius (930 degrees Fahrenheit) in five years time, similar to
the level of fossil fuel-burning generators, Geyer said at a
conference in Barcelona.  More efficient use of heat, compared with today’s
temperatures for solar-thermal of about 380 degrees Celsius,
will bring down costs, said the executive of Seville, Spain-
based Abengoa, a developer of solar-thermal plants.  “This will go along with an increase in the cycle
efficiency of about 30 percent,” Geyer said. “That means we’ll
reduce the costs by this amount.”  Policymakers and executives are meeting in the Spanish city
this week to build support for Desertec, an initiative that aims
to connect Europe to solar power in the Sahara through high-
voltage transmission cables. Governments must agree on sharing
investments and supplies before it goes forward.  Solar-thermal power costs about $288 per megawatt-hour to
generate compared with about $60 for electricity from coal-fired
plants, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
