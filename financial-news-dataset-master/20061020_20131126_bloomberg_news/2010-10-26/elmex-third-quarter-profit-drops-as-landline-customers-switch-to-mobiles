Telefonos de Mexico SAB , the
nation’s largest landline phone company, said third-quarter
profit fell 21 percent as its phone clients switched to wireless
voice plans and cable-TV carriers.  Net income dropped to 3.76 billion pesos ($304 million), or
21 centavos a share, from 4.79 billion pesos, or 26 centavos, a
year earlier, Mexico City-based Telmex said yesterday. Sales
fell 3.2 percent to 28.6 billion pesos.  Telmex, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s America
Movil SAB, is boosting Internet speeds to keep customers from
switching to cable carriers affiliated with Grupo Televisa SA.
Telmex is investing in fiber-optic technology to double its
fastest download rates for home users to as much as 10 megabits
a second.  Phone lines operated by Telmex fell to 15.6 million, a loss
of 122,000 from the previous quarter. High-speed Internet
subscriptions increased 220,000 to 7.2 million.  Telmex Chief Financial Officer  Adolfo Cerezo  today boosted
his forecast for 2010 capital spending to 11 billion pesos from
an earlier prediction of 10 billion, as the company invests in
its network. Next year’s capital spending will probably be
similar to this year’s, Cerezo said on a conference call.  After capital investments, Telmex’s biggest priority for
its cash will be to reduce  debt , Cerezo said. Net debt was $5.54
billion at the end of September, down 15 percent from a year
earlier. The company hasn’t repurchased shares the past two
quarters, according to company filings.  Telmex gained 2 centavos to 9.48 pesos at 11:22 a.m. New
York time in Mexico City  trading . The shares had dropped
14 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
