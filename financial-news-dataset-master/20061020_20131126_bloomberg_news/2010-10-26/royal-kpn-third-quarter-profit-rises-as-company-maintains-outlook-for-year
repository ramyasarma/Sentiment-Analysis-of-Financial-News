Royal KPN NV , the largest Dutch
phone company, said third-quarter profit rose 2 percent, less
than analysts estimated, as higher finance and interest expenses
held back earnings growth.  Net income increased to 406 million euros ($567 million)
from 398 million euros in the year-earlier period, the  company 
said in a statement today. Revenue rose to 3.34 billion euros
from 3.31 billion euros. Analysts had predicted profit of 449
million euros on sales of 3.33 billion euros, according to
Bloomberg  estimates .  “We are confident of achieving our objectives for 2010 and
the outlook for 2011, which will provide the platform for KPN to
move forward in 2011 under the leadership of  Eelco Blok ,” Chief
Executive Officer  Ad Scheepbouwer  said in the release.  KPN, based in The Hague, on Oct. 18 appointed Blok to
succeed Scheepbouwer, who’s retiring. Blok, who’s been on KPN’s
board since 2004 and is currently responsible for international
activities including calling-minutes wholesaler iBasis, will
take the helm on April 6.  The company repeated that  revenue  this year will be “in
line with” last year’s 13.5 billion euros, with earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at more than 5.5
billion euros.  KPN advanced 1.9 percent to 11.745 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of Amsterdam trading, giving it a market value of 18.5
billion euros.  2010, 2011 Outlook  Third-quarter Ebitda rose 5.9 percent to 1.41 billion
euros. The average estimate of 19 analysts was 1.37 billion
euros.  “An Ebitda beat of this magnitude should provide comfort
that 2010 and 2011 outlook are easily achievable,”  Saeed Baradar , Societe Generale SA’s telecommunications sales
specialist, said in an e-mail.  Finance costs in the period surged to 296 million euros
from 181 million euros in the same period last year. The higher
expenses were related to a bond tender in September and “higher
interest costs as a result of higher average borrowings,” the
company said.  Revenue at the  Dutch  telecommunications business fell 1.3
percent to 1.75 billion euros due to “continued pressure” on
the traditional business and a “challenging” competitive
environment. Profitability at the business increased, with
Ebitda margin up to 53 percent from 50.6 percent a year earlier.  Additional Spectrum  Sales in Germany, where KPN’s E-Plus is the third-largest
wireless operator, rose 3.8 percent to 850 million euros. In
May, E-Plus spent 284 million euros on additional spectrum in
the 70-megahertz frequency bands, “removing the risk of paying
too high a price for the spectrum.”  KPN was the only one of Germany’s four mobile-phone
operators that didn’t secure spectrum in the 800-megahertz band
in May. Those frequencies have a wide reach, meaning that
operators can spend less money on infrastructure to reach rural
areas.  KPN will follow the same principle at the frequency bands
auction in Belgium next year, acquiring additional spectrum
“only at reasonable prices,” it said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
