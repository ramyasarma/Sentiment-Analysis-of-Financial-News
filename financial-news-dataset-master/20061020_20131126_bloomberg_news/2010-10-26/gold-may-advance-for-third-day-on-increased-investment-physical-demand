Gold declined as some investors sold
the metal after the dollar strengthened, curbing demand for the
metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback rose as much as 0.8 percent against a basket
of six major currencies, including the euro. Through yesterday,
gold futures gained 5.3 percent since Sept. 14, when the Federal
Reserve signaled it may ease monetary policy further to spur the
economy, while the dollar lost 4.9 percent.  “Gold has been tracking the dollar much like the old
days,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago. “Gold is off again on dollar
strength.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $2, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,336.90 an ounce at 10:48 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices reached an all-time high of $1,388.10 on Oct. 14.  Gold assets in  exchange-traded products  fell 1.63 metric
tons to 2,096.41 tons yesterday, a seventh consecutive decline,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.  The metal posted records 16 times between Sept. 14 and Oct.
14 as the dollar weakened on speculation that the Fed will start
a second round of so-called quantitative easing to bolster the
economy. Fed policy makers meet next on Nov. 2-3.  ‘Too Far, Too Fast’  The gold rally has “gone too far too fast,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global in Chicago. “Such breakouts
are usually indicative of a market engine that surges forward on
its last fumes before eventually exhausting its fuel supply.”  Gold may fall to $1,260 before finding technical support,
McGhee of Integrated Brokerage Services said.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 5.6 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $23.60 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $7.70, or 0.5
percent, to $1,704.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose $5.20, or 0.9
percent, to $614 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached a nine-
year high of $620.  Platinum and palladium are used mostly to make jewelry and
pollution-control devices for cars. Palladium is up 50 percent
this year, outperforming the three other main precious metals.  Large trucks in the U.S. must cut emissions by as much as
20 percent by 2018 under the first standards planned for work
vehicles, President  Barack Obama ’s administration said
yesterday.  Platinum and palladium “may be additionally supported” by
the proposal,  Mark Pervan  and  Natalie Robertson , Melbourne-based
analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., wrote in
a report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
