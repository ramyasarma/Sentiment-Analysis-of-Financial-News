Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index
retreated for a third day, losing 71.51, or 0.3 percent, to
21,363.52 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM) sank 4.7 percent to 7.38 euros,
the biggest drop in 10 weeks. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
trimmed its price estimate on Italy’s largest independent fund
manager to 10.60 euros from 11.60 euros, while keeping a “buy”
rating. Credit Suisse Group AG lowered its price projection to 9
euros from 9.20 euros and kept an “outperform” rating. Banca
IMI downgraded the stock to “add” from “buy.”  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  (BMPS IM) retreated 1.4
percent to 1.03 euros, a second day of declines. Banking stocks
dropped in Europe, following UBS AG’s surprise investment-
banking loss.  Banco Popolare SC  (BP IM) lost 1.6 percent to 3.99 euros,
the shares fourth day of losses. HSBC Holdings Plc cut its
rating to “neutral” from “overweight” after the board of
Italy’s fifth-biggest bank approved a plan for a share sale of
as much as 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion). The brokerage said
the sale will increase the number of outstanding shares by 76
percent.  “We calculate a 39 percent earnings-per-share dilution on
the basis of our assumptions,” it wrote in a note.  Luxottica Group SpA  (LUX IM) dropped 1.9 percent to 20.95
euros. The owner of the Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses brands
said it aims to raise net income 27 percent this year after
demand in emerging markets and renewed interest in luxury
glasses boosted quarterly sales.  Barclays cut its recommendation to “equal weight” from
“overweight,” citing the stock’s “strong performance,” while
Nomura Holdings Inc., UBS AG and Natixis Securities increased
their price estimates to 23 euros, 23.50 euros and 27 euros,
respectively.  Saipem SpA  (SPM IM) slid 2.4 percent to 31.36 euros, ending
four days of gains. Barclays downgraded Europe’s largest
oilfield-services provider to “equal weight” from
“overweight.”  “Saipem continues to be the most balanced, well-run
company in the sector,” the brokerage said. “This is largely
reflected in its valuation.”  Kepler Capital Markets increased its price estimate to 31
euros from 28 euros.  Tenaris SpA  (TEN IM), the world’s biggest maker of seamless
steel tubes, dropped 1.7 percent to 14.83 euros, its first loss
in three days. Oil declined in New York as investors speculated
that slowing demand for fuel will cause inventories to rise in
