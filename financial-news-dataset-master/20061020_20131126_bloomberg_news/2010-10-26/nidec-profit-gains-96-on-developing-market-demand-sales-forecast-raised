Nidec Corp. , the world’s biggest
maker of motors for hard-disk drives, said first-half profit
rose 96 percent as demand recovered in developing markets. The
company raised its annual sales forecast.  Net income climbed to 27 billion yen ($333 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30, from 13.8 billion yen a year earlier,
the Kyoto-based company said in a statement today. To help meet
its full-year profit target of 63 billion yen, the company plans
to shift more production outside Japan to offset the effects on
the yen’s strength.  “The strong yen is having an extremely bad effect, so we
want to spread out our manufacturing over different countries,”
President  Shigenobu Nagamori  said today at a briefing in Osaka.
“We want to prepare for any extreme situation, even if 1 dollar
equaled 10 yen.”  The yen, which has gained 13 percent against the U.S.
dollar since Nidec’s fiscal year started on April 1, traded at
81.04 yen as of 5:23 p.m. in Tokyo.  Nidec’s operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods
sold and administrative expenses, rose 82 percent to 51.5
billion yen in the first half, exceeding the 50.7 billion yen
average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue jumped 27 percent to 340.8 billion yen, more than
the 330.7 billion yen expected by the analysts. Nidec, which
today raised its full-year sales forecast by 6.1 percent to 700
billion yen, targets 2 trillion yen annual sales by the end of
fiscal 2015. The company last month completed its purchase of
Emerson Electric Co.’s motor and controls unit to expand its
home appliance and automobile businesses in the U.S.  ‘Risky’ Japan  Nagamori declined to comment on a report the company is in
talks with Sanyo Electric Co. to buy its motor business.  Nidec  shares  fell 0.4 percent to close at 7,200 yen on the
Osaka Securities Exchange before the announcement. Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent.  The company, which supplies hard drive makers  Seagate
Technology Plc  and  Western Digital Corp.  with brushless motors,
has seen its percentage of domestic sales shrink in the last
three years. About 56 percent of  revenue  came from overseas last
fiscal year, with China and Thailand its two largest foreign
markets.  “There are risks in any country,” Nagamori said. “But
the biggest risk now is in Japan. The yen is very strong,
corporate tax is high, and labor regulations are strict.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
