The pound extended gains against the
dollar and the euro after data showed gross domestic product in
the three months through September rose twice as much as
economists estimated.  The U.K. currency rose as much as 0.8 percent to $1.5842
and was at $1.5841 as of 9:34 a.m. in London. Against the euro,
sterling appreciated 0.8 percent to 88.12 pence.  Gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent in the third
quarter after increasing 1.2 percent in the previous quarter,
the Office for National Statistics said today. Economists
forecast a 0.4 percent gain, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
