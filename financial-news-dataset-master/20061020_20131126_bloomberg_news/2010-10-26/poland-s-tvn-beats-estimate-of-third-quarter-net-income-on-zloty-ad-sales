TVN SA , Poland’s only publicly
traded television network, said third-quarter profit rose 4.7
percent as advertising sales grew and the strengthening zloty
increased profit from financial operations.  Net income increased to 61 million zloty ($21.7 million)
from 58.2 million zloty a year earlier, Warsaw-based TVN said in
a regulatory statement today. That compares with the 36.9
million-zloty average estimate of eight analysts  surveyed  by
Bloomberg News.  The zloty strengthened 4.1 percent against the euro in the
three months ended Sept. 30, helping TVN benefit from the
valuation of its euro-denominated debt. The zloty gained 5.9
percent during the same period last year.  TVN’s sales rose an annual 25 percent to 533.8 million
zloty as television advertising revenue added 13 percent and
sales at N, the company’s satellite television unit, increased
56 percent to 159.2 million zloty. N showed positive earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for a
second straight quarter, reporting profit at this level of 7.2
million zloty, compared with a loss of 34.3 million zloty a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
