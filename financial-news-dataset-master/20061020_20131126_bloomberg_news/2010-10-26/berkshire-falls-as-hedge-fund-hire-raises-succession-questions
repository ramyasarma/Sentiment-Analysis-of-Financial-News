Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  fell the
most in two months after the hiring of an investment manager
raised concerns that Chairman Warren Buffett’s results would be
difficult for his successors to duplicate.  Berkshire declined $3,032, or 2.4 percent, to $121,998 at
2:46 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
Omaha, Nebraska-based company fell 2.7 percent on Aug. 11  Buffett, 80, announced yesterday that Berkshire, which the
billionaire built through four decades of stock picks and
takeovers, was bringing on Connecticut-based hedge fund manager
Todd Combs to help him manage investments.  “It reinforces the message, at some point in time somebody
else is going to be running the company,” said  Meyer Shields ,
an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. “And that pressures the
stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
