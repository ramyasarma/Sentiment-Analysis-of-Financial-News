The Middle East may rival China,
India and Brazil as a destination for investment due to its
growing population and wealth, said  David Rubenstein , co-founder
and managing director of the Carlyle Group.  “I find it extremely appealing to invest in the Middle
East, North Africa region because the potential is there,”
Rubenstein said today at the World Economic Forum in Marrakesh,
Morocco. “Turkey and Egypt probably have the best opportunity
right now.”  The economies of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East
and North Africa are expected to expand 3.8 percent this year
while the economies of oil importers in the region, along with
Afghanistan and Pakistan, are forecast to grow 5 percent,
according to the Washington-based International Monetary Fund.
That compares with the U.S.’s expected 2.6 percent expansion
this year and 2.3 percent growth in 2011, according to the IMF.  Washington-based Carlyle Group raised $500 million for its
first Middle East and North Africa fund in March last year after
seeking as much as twice that amount. The company said March 29
it bought a 30 percent stake in General Lighting Co., Saudi
Arabia’s biggest lighting-fixtures manufacturer, without
disclosing its price.  “Increasingly you’re going to see capital coming in from
Asia and Europe,” as investors realize the opportunities,
Rubenstein said. Carlyle is the world’s second-largest private
equity company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
