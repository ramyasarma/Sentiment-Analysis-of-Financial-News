Japan’s 10-year bonds fell for a
fourth day as the yen retreated from a 15-year high, damping
demand for the relative safety of debt.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  climbed to a three-week high on
prospects the currency’s slide will reduce pressure on the Bank
of Japan to announce additional easing measures at its policy
meeting tomorrow. Japan’s bonds also declined after Treasuries
dropped yesterday on prospects debt purchases by the Federal
Reserve will spur inflation.  “A pause in the yen’s advance doesn’t give the BOJ an
incentive to take additional action,” said  Tadashi Matsukawa ,
head of fixed income at PineBridge Investments Japan Co., which
manages the equivalent of about $70 billion. “Yields seem to be
bottoming out globally.”  The yield on the 0.8 percent bond due September 2020 rose
3.5 basis points to 0.945 percent, the most since Oct. 4, at
3:03 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The price fell 0.312 yen to
98.689 yen. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Twenty-year yields gained five basis points to 1.81 percent.
Ten-year bond futures for December delivery dropped 0.24 to
143.18 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The yen slid for a second day, touching 81.82 per dollar.
It reached 80.41 on Oct. 25, the strongest since April 1995.  Yield Forecast  Ten-year yields may rise to 1.2 percent by year-end,
according to PineBridge’s Matsukawa. Should his forecast prove
accurate, investors who purchase the securities today will incur
a 2.1 percent loss, Bloomberg calculations show.  Japan’s central bank unexpectedly cut rates to near zero on
Oct. 5 and decided to create a 5 trillion-yen ($61 billion) fund
to purchase assets. All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
said the BOJ will refrain from easing policy further tomorrow.  Fed policy makers, who already cut  interest rates  almost to
zero and bought $1.7 trillion of securities, are mulling more
asset purchases to flood markets with cheap money and prevent
stagnating prices from undermining the recovery. The Fed may
announce a new round of so-called quantitative easing measures
at its next meeting on Nov. 2-3.  Treasury 10-year yields gained eight basis points to 2.64
percent yesterday, according to BGCantor Market Data.  Japan’s sale of two-year notes today drew bids worth 5.54
times the amount on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 5.75 at the September sale. The lowest price at
the sale was 99.920, higher than 99.915, the median forecast of
14 traders surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The auction was fine,” said  Akito Fukunaga , chief rates
strategist in Tokyo at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank. “We continue to see
steady demand for short-term notes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
