International Dairy Queen Inc. , the
ice-cream maker owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. , settled a lawsuit that claimed Yogubliz Inc. violated its
trademark in calling a dessert Blizz Frozen Yogurt.  Yogubliz will continue to use the Blizz name, said Stephen
E. Abraham, the company’s Newport Beach, California-based
attorney. Terms weren’t disclosed in the settlement, filed
yesterday in federal court in Los Angeles. Dairy Queen had tried
to halt sales of Blizz desserts, saying they caused confusion
with its best-selling Blizzard product.  “Today, Blizz frozen yogurt appears in yogurt shops,”
Abraham said in a telephone interview. “Tomorrow, Blizz Frozen
Yogurt is going to appear in yogurt shops.”  Dairy Queen, which operates restaurants in every U.S. state
except Vermont, was purchased by Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire 
in 1998. Buffett, Berkshire’s chief executive officer,  built the
parent company  with investments in brands including Coca-Cola
Co. and American Express Co.  Dairy Queen’s attorneys,  David Steinberg  of Los Angeles-
based Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp LLP and Laura Hein of
Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Gray Plant Mooty, didn’t
immediately return calls for comment.  “I think both companies are happy with the result,” said
Abraham. “Dairy Queen will exist with its product and product
line, and Yogubliz will exist with its product and product
line.”  The case is Yogubliz Inc. v. American Dairy Queen Corp.,
2:10-cv-03677, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles).  To contact the reporter on this story:
