Mediobanca SpA,  Italy’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank, may say fiscal first-quarter
profit dropped 52 percent after earning less from trading and
commissions.  Net income probably fell to 97 million euros ($136 million)
in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 201 million euros a
year earlier, according to the average estimate of seven
 analysts surveyed  by Bloomberg. The bank is due to publish
results on Oct. 28.  “The year-on-year comparison should be tough due to the
booming trading income in the first quarter of 2010 and the
flattish volumes”  Daniela Miccolis , an analyst at Banca
Leonardo with a “buy” rating on Mediobanca shares, wrote in an
Oct. 20 note to investors.  Mediobanca is trying to expand outside its home market by
taking advantage of lower asset prices after the credit crunch,
and is diversifying its product offerings to boost revenue.
Chief Executive Officer  Alberto Nagel , who last month said the
investment bank doesn’t have any concerns about funding, aims to
continue paying dividends for the current year.  Net trading income in the quarter probably slumped 82
percent to 50 million euros, while net fees and commissions may
have declined 19 percent to 118 million euros, according to the
analysts’ estimates.  Below is a table of analysts’ forecasts and year-earlier
figures in millions of euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
