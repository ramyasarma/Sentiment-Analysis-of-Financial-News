South Africa may ground its fleet of
Grippen jet fighters, worth 10 billion rand, because of a lack
of funding to keep them flying, Business Day said, citing the
Department of Defence’s annual report.  The move may leave the country without an air defense
capability, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. South African
police earlier this month abandoned a probe into alleged
corruption into the purchase of fighter jets and frigates more
than a decade ago.  Government officials were first accused by an opposition
party politician in 1999 of taking bribes from companies
including BAE Systems Plc and a group including ThyssenKrupp AG,  which won weapon contracts worth $5 billion. The Hawks
investigative unit ended the probe because it “wasn’t really
getting anywhere,” spokesman Musa Zondi said on Oct. 15.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
