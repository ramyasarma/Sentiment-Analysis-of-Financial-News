The Vatican has asked Iraq not to
carry out the hanging of its former foreign minister Tariq Aziz.  The 74-year-old Aziz, a former top aide of Saddam Hussein,
was found guilty by the High Criminal Court “of the liquidation
of members of religious parties” and sentenced to hang, 
al-Iraqiya television channel said.  “The Catholic Church’s position on the death penalty is
known,” Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said in an e-mailed
statement. The Vatican will adopt diplomatic channels available
to try and stop the execution from taking place, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
