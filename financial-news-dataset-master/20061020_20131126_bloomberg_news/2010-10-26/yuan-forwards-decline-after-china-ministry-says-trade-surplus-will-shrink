Yuan forwards declined on
speculation appreciation pressure will ease after China’s
commerce ministry said the country’s trade surplus will narrow.  China’s 2010 trade surplus will “definitely” be smaller
than in 2009, Vice Commerce Minister Zhong Shan told reporters
in Beijing today. The central bank has kept the reference rate
for yuan trading little changed over the past two days after U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  met Chinese Vice Premier
Wang Qishan in Qingdao on Oct. 24 to discuss ties between the
two nations.  “The shrinking trade surplus will ease pressure on the
yuan,” said  Zhao Qingming , a senior analyst at China
Construction Bank Corp. in Beijing, the country’s second-largest
lender. “There won’t be any big change in the exchange rate
following Geithner’s meeting with Wang.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.3 percent
to 6.4600 per dollar as of 11:58 a.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting
bets the currency will strengthen 3 percent from the spot rate
of 6.6614, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exports  exceeded  imports by $17 billion in September, the
smallest monthly surplus in five months and bringing this year’s
total trade balance to $121 billion, according to customs bureau
data on Oct. 13.  The central bank set the reference rate at 6.6762 per
dollar today, compared with 6.6729 yesterday.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Simon Harvey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
