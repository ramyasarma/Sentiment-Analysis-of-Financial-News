Japanese  stocks  fluctuated with
utilities gaining as a strong yen reduced their costs, while
brokerages declined on low trading volume.  Chubu Electric Power Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co,
utility companies, advanced at least 1.5 percent. JX Holdings
Inc., Japan’s largest oil refiner and copper producer, advanced
2.3 percent on higher oil and metal prices. Sony, the maker of
Bravia televisions and Vaio computers, climbed 2 percent. Nomura
Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage, sank 1.6 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average was little changed at 9,399.05
as of 2:43 p.m. The broader  Topix  index lost 0.2 percent to
819.80. Stocks earlier advanced following a jump in futures on
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in December in Osaka
trading.  The Topix has declined 9.4 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 6.3 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 5.3
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are valued at 14.7 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen appreciated to 80.41 against the dollar yesterday
after stock trading closed in Tokyo, the highest level since
April 1995. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies
when overseas revenue is converted into their home currency. The
yen traded at 80.83 as of 1:52 p.m.  Brokerages declined the most among the 33 industry groups
in the Topix. The shares fell “on concern about declines in
securities transaction fees” after trading volume on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange’s first section yesterday dropped to the lowest
since Sept. 28, according to Kenichi Hirano, general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. A total of 1.32 billion
shares traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s first section as of
2:45 p.m. compared with a daily average of 1.95 billion.  Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest brokerage, sank 1.6
percent to 438 yen. Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the second-
biggest, retreated 1.4 percent to 342 yen.  To contact the reporter for this story:
