Romania’s  budget deficit  widened in
September from the previous month to 4.56 percent of gross
domestic product, below the target set by the  International
Monetary Fund  in the Balkan nation’s bailout-loan agreement.  The shortfall totaled 23.3 billion lei ($7.6 billion),
compared with a target for a gap of 28.2 billion lei, according
to an e-mailed statement from the Finance Ministry in Bucharest
late yesterday. The deficit at the end of August was 20.9
billion lei, or 4.1 percent of GDP.  The country is counting on a 20 billion-euro ($28 billion)
loan from a group of international lenders to stay afloat amid
its worst recession on record. Lawmakers cut wages and increased
a value-added tax as they try to meet an IMF-agreed deficit
target of 6.8 percent of GDP for the year after posting a 7.2
percent gap in 2009.  Revenue rose 3.6 percent annually and 11.7 percent on the
month after the government increased the VAT by 5 percentage
points to 24 percent in July, the ministry said. Expenditures
rose 1.5 percent on the year and 11.5 percent from August on
increased unemployment costs and the payment of overdue debt to
the health-care system.  Romania’s budget-deficit figures look “promising,”  IMF
Mission Chief to Romania  Jeffrey Franks  said on Oct.20. The
Washington-based lender has reason to be “optimistic” for the
remaining of the year, he said.  The IMF and government estimate GDP will contract as much
as 1.9 percent this year, after shrinking a record 7.1 percent
in 2009. There might be an adjustment of the economic forecasts,
Franks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
