France’s benchmark CAC 40 Index lost
0.5 percent to 3,852.66 at the 5:40 p.m. close in Paris. The  SBF
120 Index  also slid 0.6 percent.  The following is a list of companies whose shares may have
unusual price changes in the French capital. Stock symbols are
in parentheses.  Air Liquide SA  (AI FP) lost 1.02 euros, or 1.1 percent, to
95.21 euros even as the world’s biggest producer of industrial
gases reported third-quarter sales ahead of analysts’ estimates,
bolstered by a stronger dollar. Chief Financial Officer  Fabienne Lecorvaisier  said the margin of the company’s gas and services
unit may post a “slight decrease” this year compared to 2009,
which benefited from “exceptional elements.”  ArcelorMittal  (MT NA) dropped 1.24 euros, or 5 percent, to
23.78 after the world’s biggest steelmaker forecast a decline in
fourth-quarter earnings because of falling steel prices and
rising costs.  “Our outlook for the fourth quarter remains cautious as
the expected higher input prices continue to work through the
business and demand remains muted,” Chief Executive Officer
 Lakshmi Mittal  said.  ECA  (ECASA FP) increased 39 cents, or 2.7 percent, to 14.79
euros after the maker of defense equipment reported a 49 percent
increase in third-quarter sales to 24.4 million euros ($34
million) and confirmed its full-year targets.  Faiveley Transport  (LEY FP) dropped 2.24 euros, or 3.5
percent, to 61.26 euros. The maker of railroad equipment
reported a 4.7 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter revenue to
207.9 million euros and reiterated that sales this year will be
“stable”, with a return to growth next year.  Hermes International SCA  (RMS FP) dropped 23.85 euros, or
12 percent, to 179 euros. Index-tracking funds may dump about
about 1 million shares in Hermes as a stake purchase by LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA will cut Hermes’ weight in
benchmarks, according to an analyst at Societe Generale SA.  Renault SA  (RNO FP) dropped 1.28 euros, or 3 percent, to
41.91, falling for the first time in six days. Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said the company expects Western Europe’s
auto market will only recover in 2012 as the after-effects of
state sales incentives linger next year. He was speaking in an
interview at the World Economic Forum in Marrakesh, Morocco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
