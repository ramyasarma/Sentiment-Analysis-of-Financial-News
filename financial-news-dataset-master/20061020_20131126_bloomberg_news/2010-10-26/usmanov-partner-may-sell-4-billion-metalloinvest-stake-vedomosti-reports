Vasily Anisimov may sell his 20
percent stake in Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s
Metalloinvest holding company for $4 billion, Vedomosti
reported, citing Anisimov and its own estimates.   Anisimov, 59, is discussing selling his stake with Usmanov
and State Duma Deputy Andrei Skoch, owners of 50 percent and 30
percent of Metalloinvest, respectively, the Moscow-based
newsaper said, citing Anisimov. Usmanov is helping Anisimov find
a buyer if he chooses to sell, Vedomosti said.  Metalloinvest, the largest producer of iron ore in the
former Soviet Union, plans to hold an initial public offering
early next year, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
