Cotton soared to a record for a
second day on concern that weather damage to crops in the U.S.
and China will curb supplies.  Cotton for December delivery jumped as much as 3.1 percent
to $1.2854 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the highest
price since the commodity began trading 140 years ago, and was
at $1.2665 a pound at 9:04 a.m. in Singapore.  The exchange boosted the limit on futures gains for today’s
trading to 6 cents after the contract advanced by the 5-cent
limit yesterday, and by a 4-cent limit on Oct. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
