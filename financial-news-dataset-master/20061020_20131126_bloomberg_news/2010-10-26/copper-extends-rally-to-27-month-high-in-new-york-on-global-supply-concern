Copper prices rose in New York,
extending a rally to a 27-month high, on signs that global
demand will outpace supplies.  Inventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange have
dropped to the lowest level in a year amid analyst forecasts for
a global shortfall this year and next. Copper has gained 6
percent this month, partly because of the dollar’s decline. The
greenback rebounded today against a basket of currencies.  “Copper, being an industrial metal, is exhibiting more
strength than the rest of the commodity complex, even with a
stronger dollar,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “There’s still a lot of
pent-up demand for copper.”  Copper futures for December delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $3.869 a pound at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. Earlier, the metal reached $3.893, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 2008.  The Conference Board said today that its U.S. consumer-
confidence index increased to 50.2 in October from a revised
48.6, a seven-month low, in September. That topped estimates by
analysts.  “With consumer confidence on the uptick and a barometer
for economic health, an industrial metal like copper is going to
benefit,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago.  Copper for delivery in three months dropped $8 to $8,510 a
metric ton ($3.86 a pound) on the LME.  Nickel and tin also fell in London. Lead, zinc and aluminum
gained.  To contact the reporter on the story:
