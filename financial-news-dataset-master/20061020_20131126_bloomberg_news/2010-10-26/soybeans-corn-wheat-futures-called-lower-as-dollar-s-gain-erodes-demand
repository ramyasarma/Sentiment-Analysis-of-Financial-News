What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower on
the Chicago Board of Trade as the dollar’s gain reduces demand
for commodities as alternative assets, said  Greg Grow , the
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $2.50 lower per
2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open down 0.05 cent
to 0.1 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures were called 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower as
livestock-feed producers shift to cheaper grain, Grow said. Corn
prices jumped 33 percent in the third quarter and are up 14
percent this month.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the dollar’s rebound erodes the appeal of U.S.
exports, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
