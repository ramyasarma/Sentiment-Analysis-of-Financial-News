Perpetual Ltd. , the subject of a
A$1.75 billion ($1.73 billion) bid from  KKR & Co. , is
considering the legal implications of selling its trustee
business after last week’s offer from the private equity firm.  The Australian asset manager yesterday said the bid from
New York-based KKR doesn’t reflect the fair value of the company
as it agreed to enter talks. KKR last week offered as much as
A$40 a share for the company to tap expanding wealth in the
world’s fourth-biggest pool of managed funds.  “The proposal doesn’t go into the detail we need on the
regulatory issues associated with a trustee company,” Chairman
Peter Scott said in an interview today. “We don’t see that’s an
insurmountable problem, but it’s time-taking and detailed
work.” Perpetual has been an estate trustee since  1888 , its
website says.  Payments to Perpetual workers are among elements of KKR’s
proposal that need to be considered, Scott said. He said he’s
not aware of any independent approaches by KKR to garner support
from Perpetual’s  asset managers , which include  John Sevior , head
of equities, and senior portfolio manager  Matt Williams .  Perpetual  stock  today was unchanged at A$37.90 at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney. Perpetual, which had A$27.6 billion of
funds under management as of Sept. 30, hasn’t assessed other
possible bidders, Scott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
