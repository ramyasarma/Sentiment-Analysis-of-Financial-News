European Union leaders may consider
a “very focused” fine-tuning of EU treaties to meet German
demands for the creation of a debt-crisis management mechanism,
a Hungarian official said.  Germany’s call for new rules to set up a state-insolvency
procedure faces opposition from governments loathe to reopen an
EU treaty debate less than a year after the last one ended.  “Most member states are reluctant,”  Eniko Gyori ,
Hungarian European affairs minister, told reporters in Brussels
today. “If it’s the case, we have to be very focused, not to
open a Pandora’s box.”  Germany will make its case for a treaty rewrite at an Oct.
28-29 EU summit in Brussels, demanding a permanent mechanism to
replace the taxpayer-funded 750 billion-euro ($1 trillion)
financial backstop for debt-hit governments that expires in
2013.  While the call for a crisis-resolution system has won
backing, European governments are “much more cautious” about
German proposals to deny EU voting rights to countries that
overstep deficit limits, Gyori said.  The job of shepherding the treaty negotiations would fall
to Hungary, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency in the
first half of 2011. EU treaties require unanimous approval by
all 27 countries.  The last overhaul was eight years in the making, dogged by
referendum defeats in three countries and last-minute veto
threats in the Czech Republic.  When it took effect in December 2009 “everyone, without
exception, was saying: finally,” Gyori said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
