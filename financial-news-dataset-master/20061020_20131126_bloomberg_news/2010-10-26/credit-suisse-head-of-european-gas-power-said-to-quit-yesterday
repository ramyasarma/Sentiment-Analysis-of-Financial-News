Haakon Olafsson ,  Credit Suisse 
Group AG’s head of trading for European power and natural gas,
resigned yesterday after about a year in the role, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Olafsson joined the Zurich-based bank in 2009 from Rampart
Capital LLP, a London-based energy hedge fund that closed in
May, according to the person, who asked not be identified
because the departure hasn’t been announced. Olafsson also
worked as head of European energy trading at Lehman Brothers
Inc. and started his career in commodities at Cargill Inc.,
according to a Rampart marketing document from August 2008.  A call today to Olafsson via the Credit Suisse switchboard
in London was answered by an employee declining to identify
himself. Adam Bradbery, a Credit Suisse spokesman in London,
declined to comment on Olafsson.  Credit Suisse registered Olafsson as an employee as of Dec.
1, 2009, according to the U.K.’s Financial Services Authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
