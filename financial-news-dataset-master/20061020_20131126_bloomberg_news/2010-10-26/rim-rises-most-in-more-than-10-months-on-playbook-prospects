Research In Motion Ltd. climbed the
most in more than 10 months after an analyst said the company’s
demonstration of its PlayBook tablet computer suggests it may be
a credible rival to Apple Inc.’s iPad.  RIM climbed as much as 9.5 percent to $56.62 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading and was trading 7.7 percent higher at
$55.69 at 2:08 p.m. The stock rose 5.5 percent yesterday.  “RIM’s outperformance over the last two days may be due to
the market’s continued digestion and increasing approval” of
the PlayBook, said Tero Kuittinen, an analyst at MKM Partners
LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
