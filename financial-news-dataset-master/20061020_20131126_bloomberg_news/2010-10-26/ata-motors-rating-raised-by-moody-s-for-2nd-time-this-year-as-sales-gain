Tata Motors Ltd. , the owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, had its credit rating raised by Moody’s
Investors Service for the second time this year as sales of its
vehicles increased.  The corporate family rating on Tata Motors was increased to
Ba3, three levels below investment grade, from B2, Moody’s said
today. The rating company also changed the outlook on Mumbai-
based Tata Motors to stable from positive.  “The rating upgrade reflects the recovery in the operating
performance of the Jaguar Land Rover business exceeding our
expectations,”  Alan Greene , an analyst at Moody’s, said in a
statement. Tata Motors is “seeing a solid recovery in its
Indian business,” Moody’s said.  Tata Motors  boosted sales of its vehicles, including Jaguar
luxury cars and Land Rover sport-utility vehicles, by 19 percent
in September. Net income may surge to 14.4 billion rupees ($324
million) in the second quarter ended Sept. 30, from 217.8
million rupees a year earlier, according to the  average  of 17
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, also India’s biggest truckmaker, said Oct. 12
that it raised $750 million selling shares overseas to pare debt.
Tata Motors said yesterday it will report earnings on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
