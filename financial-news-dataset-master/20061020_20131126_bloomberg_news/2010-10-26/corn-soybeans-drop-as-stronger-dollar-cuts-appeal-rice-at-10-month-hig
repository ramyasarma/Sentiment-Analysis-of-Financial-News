Corn and soybeans fell in Chicago as
the dollar strengthened, reducing the appeal of U.S. crops to
importers and investors.  Corn for December delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $5.66 a
bushel at 12:53 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybeans for January delivery fell 0.2 percent to $12.28 a
bushel after yesterday touching $12.355, the highest price for a
most-active contract since June 5, 2009.  The U.S. will be the world’s largest exporter of corn ahead
of Argentina in 2010-2011 and the biggest of soybeans ahead of
Brazil, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts. The dollar
climbed 0.1 percent against the euro after falling in the prior
two days. A stronger dollar makes crops priced in the currency
more expensive in terms of other monies.  “Prices in Chicago are adjusting as a function of the
euro-dollar rate,” Sebastien Poncelet, a consultant at Paris-
based farm adviser Agritel, said via phone. “There are no other
factors today.”  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to $6.745 a
bushel. Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris rose 0.4 percent to 209.25 euros ($292) a metric ton.  Rough rice for January delivery slipped in Chicago,
reversing a gain to the highest price since Jan. 11. The
contract dropped 0.2 percent to $14.925 per 100 pounds after
reaching $14.99. The most-active contract climbed for a 10th day
yesterday.  The staple food for half the world has jumped 56 percent
from this year’s low on June 30 as global supplies were
threatened by weather damage to crops in Pakistan and Thailand,
which represent a combined 43 percent of global exports. Rice
costs $80.55 a ton more than wheat, after slumping to a discount
of about $53 in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
