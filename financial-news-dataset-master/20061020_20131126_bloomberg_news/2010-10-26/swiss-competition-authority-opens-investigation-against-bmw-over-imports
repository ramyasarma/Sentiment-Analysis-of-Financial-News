Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest luxury-car maker, is being investigated by Swiss
antitrust authorities for allegedly preventing vehicle sales in
some European countries to Swiss residents.  The Swiss Competition Commission  said  today it has
information BMW distribution branches in the European Economic
Area, which includes the European Union’s 27 member countries as
well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, are barring sales of
BMW and Mini brand vehicles to Swiss citizens.  The Swiss franc has gained more than 9 percent against the
euro this year, making BMW vehicles relatively more expensive in
Switzerland, which isn’t part of the European Union. Munich,
Germany-based BMW could face a maximum fine of 10 percent of
group revenue in Switzerland over the past three years,  Patrik Ducrey , a Swiss commission spokesman, said by telephone.  “Such a fine would be fairly sizeable for BMW’s regional
branch though Switzerland isn’t a key market,” said  Daniel Schwarz , a Frankfurt-based analyst at Commerzbank AG who
recommends holding the stock.  BMW and Mini brand sales in Switzerland last year totaled
19,300 vehicles, spokesman  Markus Sagemann  said.  In Switzerland, BMW is selling the 5-Series sedan from
62,200 Swiss francs ($64,018), including the 7.6 percent value-
added tax, and the top-of-the-line 7-Series from 105,300 Swiss
francs, according to the carmaker’s Web site. The starting price
of the 5-Series in Germany with sales tax is 41,900 euros
($58,459) and the 7-Series is 73,300 euros.  “We have asked BMW for comment after we opened our
inquiries yesterday,” Ducrey said, adding that the
investigation may take as long as two years. A BMW spokesman
confirmed the investigation and declined to comment further.  BMW  fell  28 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 50.44 euros at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt. The stock has gained 59
percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 32.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
