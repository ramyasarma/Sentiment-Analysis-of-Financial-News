Truvo USA LLC, a publisher of
telephone directories in Europe, won bankruptcy court approval
for a restructuring plan that hands ownership of the company to
senior lenders.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Arthur Gonzalez  in Manhattan approved
Truvo’s plan at a court hearing today. An earlier settlement
resolved objections from noteholders, including
 AllianceBernstein LP .  “The plan enjoys overwhelming support of creditors at all
levels of the capital structure,” Sean O’Neal, Truvo’s
bankruptcy attorney, said at the hearing.  Truvo, a unit of Truvo Luxembourg Sarl, filed for
bankruptcy in July with a plan to give control of the company to
lenders owed 777.6 million euros ($1.08 billion).  Under the plan, senior lenders will own “substantially
all” of the equity of the company, known as Truvo Group, the
company said in a statement. The lenders, including  Allied Irish
Banks Plc  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , will receive a recovery of
between 66.6 percent and 85.8 percent on their claims, according
to court papers.  Noteholders will receive 20 million euros, warrants and a
share of a tax refund, for a recovery of between 3.8 percent and
7.8 percent, according to court papers.  The case is In re Truvo USA LLC, 10-13513, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
