Hong Kong  stocks  fluctuated as oil
producers rose on higher fuel prices, while companies including
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. and BYD Co. sank after reporting
reduced earnings.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , the country’s biggest
refiner, rose 1.9 percent, and PetroChina Co., the largest oil
company, increased 0.9 percent on higher fuel prices. Aluminum
Corp., known as Chalco and China’s No. 1 producer of the
lightweight metal, sank 3.9 percent after reporting a
consecutive quarterly loss. BYD, the carmaker backed by Warren
Buffett, tumbled 6.9 percent after posting a 99 percent decline
in third-quarter profit.  The  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.1 percent to 23,610.95 at the
midday-trading break, after rising as much as 0.4 percent.
Twenty-five stocks dropped while 19 gained on the 45-member
gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of so-called H
shares of Chinese companies slipped 0.1 percent to 13,610.87.  “Generally, the market mood is quite positive because
there is ample liquidity here,” said  Steve Tse , a research
manager at BEA Union Investment Management in Hong Kong.  Oil producers rose after China, the world’s biggest energy
consumer, increased retail gasoline and diesel prices by 3
percent today. China Petroleum, known as Sinopec, gained 1.9
percent to HK$7.56, while PetroChina increased 0.9 percent to
HK$10.02.  Biggest Gain  Shengli Oil & Gas Pipe Holdings Ltd., a Chinese supplier of
energy pipelines, jumped 5.6 percent to HK$1.90. A measure of
energy companies gained the most among the Hang Seng Composite
Index’s 11 industry groups.  The ceiling for gasoline prices will rise by 230 yuan a
metric ton and diesel prices will gain 220 yuan a ton, the
National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic
planner, said in a statement on its website yesterday.  China Shenhua Energy Co. , the nation’s largest coal
producer, climbed 1.4 percent to HK$36.70, while China Coal
Energy Co., the second-biggest, declined 0.4 percent to HK$14.80
after advancing as much as 1.4 percent. Macquarie Group Ltd.
recommended that investors switch to the two companies from
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. The brokerage cut its rating to
“neutral” from “outperform,” for Yanzhou Coal Mining, which
fell 2.7 percent to HK$23.45 today.  Rating Raised  Belle International Holdings Ltd. , China’s  No. 2 retailer
of women’s shoes, rose 3.4 percent to HK$14.16, the second-
biggest gain in the Hang Seng Index, after Macquarie Group
raised its stock rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”  The Hang Seng Index has surged 8 percent this year as
positive corporate profits and economic data eased concern
China’s steps to curb property prices and Europe’s debt crisis
will slow global growth. Stocks in the gauge trade at an average
15 times  estimated earnings , compared with 17.2 times at the
beginning of the year.  Among stocks that fell, Chalco tumbled 3.9 percent to
HK$7.57, the  biggest decline  in the Hang Seng Index. The company
yesterday reported a consecutive quarterly loss of 117.8 million
yuan ($17.7 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 after
costs rose and government limits on electricity use curbed
production.  BYD  sank 6.9 percent to HK$53 after reporting third-quarter
profit dropped 99 percent to 11.34 million yuan from a year
earlier amid faltering sales.  China Railway Construction Corp. , the builder of more than
half the nation’s railroads, tumbled 13 percent to HK$9.69 after
saying it will book a 4.15 billion yuan loss on its Mecca light-
rail project, pending compensation talks with its client.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent to 23,643.  To contact the reporter on this story:
