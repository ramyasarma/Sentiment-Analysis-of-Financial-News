Workers at the  Diamond Trading Co.
of Botswana , a joint venture between De Beers and the southern
African nation’s government, ended a two-week pay strike and
will resume work while talks over wages continue.  “The offer remains the same,” DTC spokesman Kago Mmopi
said in an e-mailed response to questions today. “The union has
decided to suspend the strike and continue with negotiations
while workers resume their duties.”  The DTCB labor union “decided to go back to work and
negotiate from within,” Chairman Kabelo Kelepile said in an
interview. He declined to rule out the possibility of the union
resuming the strike, which started on Oct. 11.  Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond producer, may produce
24 million carats of gems this year, 36 percent more than in
2009, as demand recovers from a global economic recession,
Kgomotso Abi, director of mining at Botswana’s Department of
Mines, said on July 27.  The diamonds are produced by Debswana Diamond Co., a joint
venture between the government and De Beers, and are sorted and
valued by DTC Botswana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
