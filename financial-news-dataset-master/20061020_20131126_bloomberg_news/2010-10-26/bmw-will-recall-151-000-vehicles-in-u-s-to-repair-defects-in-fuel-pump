Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  said it
is recalling about 151,000 vehicles in the U.S. for fuel-pump
defects that may reduce engine performance or cause a loss of
power-assist for the brakes and steering.  BMW, based in Munich, said it will recall about 130,000
vehicles from model years 2007 to 2010. The action covers the
355i, 135i, 535i, X6 xDrive35i Sports Activity Coupes and Z4
Roadsters Drive35i. About 40,000 of the vehicles will need new
fuel pumps, BMW said today in an e-mailed statement.  BMW said it also notified the U.S. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration of a separate recall for about 20,800
model-year 2008 X5 Sports Activity Vehicles to replace low-
pressure fuel pumps.  No injuries have been reported, BMW said.  NHTSA this year started investigations into BMW’s Mini
Cooper cars and Z4s for unrelated defects that may cause power
steering to fail, raising the risk of a crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
