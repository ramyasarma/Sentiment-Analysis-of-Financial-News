Cairn Energy Plc  expects to complete
the sale of part of its stake in an Indian unit to  Vedanta
Resources Plc  in the first quarter of 2011, Chief Executive
Officer  Bill Gammell  said.  “You will continue to see enormous amounts of speculation
in the press -- I’d ignore it all,” Gammell said today on a
conference call. “Hopefully, by the end of this year we might
get the right signals out of India. There is no particular road
block. There is just a question of going through the process”
for the approval.  Vedanta, a mining company controlled by billionaire  Anil Agarwal  with no prior oil and gas experience, said Aug. 16 it
aims to buy as much as a 60 percent in  Cairn India Ltd.  for $9.6
billion.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  last week asked Cairn for
details of Vedanta’s exploration abilities. Cairn India operates
the country’s largest onshore oil field in Rajasthan, in which
ONGC holds a 30 percent stake.  ONGC, India’s biggest energy explorer, has the pre-emptive
right, the company said Oct. 21. The government may approve the
deal by the end of December, Oil Secretary  S. Sundareshan  said
earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
