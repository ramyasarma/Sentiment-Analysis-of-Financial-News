Tullow Oil Plc  said a British Virgin
Islands court extended an injunction against the development of
oil blocks in Congo by two companies owned by  Khulubuse Zuma ,
the nephew of South African President  Jacob Zuma .  Tullow won the temporary injunction on Sept. 21 against
BVI-based Caprikat Ltd. and Foxwhelp Ltd., who have rights to
oil blocks 1 and 2 in Lake Albert that Tullow also claims.  “Tullow succeeded in extending its interim injunction
against Caprikat and Foxwhelp” at a hearing in the British
Virgin Islands on Oct. 21, Tullow Vice President  Tim O’Hanlon 
said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  “The fresh injunction has been granted until further order
of the BVI court, pending additional submissions by both sides
due by Nov. 5, 2010,” he said.  A spokeswoman at the High Court in the British Virgin
Islands confirmed the decision by the judge to reserve judgment
and extend the injunction. She declined to be named because she
wasn’t authorized to speak to the media.  “This is a positive outcome for Tullow,” O’Hanlon said.
“It means the judge was satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds for Tullow to make a claim against Caprikat and Foxwhelp
and that there is a real prospect of Tullow succeeding in
obtaining a final judgment against those companies.”  Khulubuse Zuma didn’t respond to a voicemail left on his
mobile phone requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
