Australia’s dollar fell from within
one U.S. cent of parity as the greenback rallied against most
major currencies on speculation an increase in debt purchases by
the Federal Reserve will spur inflation.  The New Zealand dollar fell for the first time in three
days as stocks and commodities weakened, damping demand for
currencies linked to growth. Australia’s dollar fell against 9
of its 16 most-traded counterparts before a government report
tomorrow that economists said will show consumer prices stayed
near the upper-limit of the central bank’s inflation target.  “It follows the story of risky assets all being slightly
taken off the table,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing director for
foreign exchange trading at Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “This
is a dollar-based move. The equity market is the leading
indicator on that.”  Australia’s currency fell 0.6 percent to 98.51 cents from
99.05 cents. Yesterday it climbed to 99.74, the strongest since
it reached parity on Oct. 15. The currency was 80.13 yen from
80.05 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 74.90 cents from
75.22, and was at 60.91 yen from 60.78 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.05 percent. Gold,
one of the country’s biggest exports, fell 0.4 percent to
$1,334.850 an ounce.  Australia’s consumer prices rose 0.8 percent last quarter,
after gaining 0.6 percent in the prior three months, according
to a Bloomberg News  survey  of economists before the Bureau of
Statistics releases the data tomorrow. A government report
yesterday showed prices paid to the nation’s producers in the
third quarter rose by the most in almost two years.  “Barring a large surprise, one data point is less
important to the Aussie outlook,” said Aroop Chatterjee, a
currency strategist at Barclays Plc in New York. “The RBA has
been signaling that monetary policy needs to be looser than what
the market had been expecting.”  Reserve Bank of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his
board next meet to review interest rates on Nov. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
