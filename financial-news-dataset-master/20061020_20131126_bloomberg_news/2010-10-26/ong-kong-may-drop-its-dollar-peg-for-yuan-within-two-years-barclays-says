Hong Kong is likely to ditch its
currency peg to the U.S. dollar within two years in favor of a
link to the yuan, according to  Peter Redward , head of Emerging
Asia research at Barclays Plc.  “It could happen quite quickly given the very rapid rise
in the circulation of the currency here,” he said today at
FinanceAsia’s ‘RMB Rising’ conference in Hong Kong. “We’re
probably looking at a 12-to-24 month horizon. Probably not less
than 12 months, but I think it could happen sooner than people
think.”  The city’s currency has been kept at about HK$7.80 versus
the greenback since 1983 and from 2005 allowed to trade up to
five cents either side of that level. The yuan has strengthened
24 percent to 6.6616 per dollar since China scrapped a peg in
July 2005. Hong Kong’s dollar was little changed at HK$7.7585 as
of 4:20 p.m. local time and 12-month forwards were also steady
at HK$7.7396, reflecting bets for a 0.2 percent appreciation.  China has ruled Hong Kong since July 1, 1997 and the
mainland is the biggest source of visitors to the city and No. 1
trading partner.  Yuan deposits  in Hong Kong more than doubled to
a record 130 billion yuan ($20 billion) in the first eight
months of 2010, according to Hong Kong Monetary Authority data,
and China’s currency is increasingly being used for cross-border
trade and fund raising.  “Watch the volatility,” according to Redward. “When the
volatility starts moving that’s the markets telling you
something is going on.”  Rising Volatility  One-year implied volatility on the city’s currency, a
measure of price swings cited by traders when pricing options,
has climbed 0.45 percentage point this month to this year’s high
of 1.18 percent. It’s poised for the biggest monthly increase
since October 2008. Still, the measure is below the average 1.26
percent reading for the past decade.  Hong Kong’s existing currency peg ties its monetary policy
to that of the U.S., which has adopted near-zero interest rates
to sustain economic growth following the global financial crisis.
Cheap borrowing costs are driving asset prices higher in the
city and HKMA Chief Executive  Norman Chan  said Oct. 18 that a
housing bubble poses the biggest threat to financial stability
in Asia.  Chan took office in October 2009 and pledged to maintain
the city’s fixed exchange rate.  Basic Law  Tim Condon , ING Groep NV’s chief Asia economist, said five
years to 10 years is a more realistic timeframe for Hong Kong to
link its exchange rate to the yuan, because such a shift can’t 
happen until China’s currency is fully convertible.  “As I understand it, the Basic Law requires that the Hong
Kong dollar has to be linked to a convertible currency,”
Singapore-based Condon said at the conference today. “That
requires that the yuan become convertible and I think that one
to two years seems to be a little bit on the quick side for that
process to take place.”  Silver dollars were used as legal tender in Hong Kong until
1935, after which the local currency was fixed to the British
pound until 1972 and then U.S. dollars for the following two
years, according to the HKMA’s Web site. After 1974 and until
1983 the city allowed its currency to float.  To contact the reporter on this story:
