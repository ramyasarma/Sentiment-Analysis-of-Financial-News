Oil & Gas Development Co. ,
Pakistan’s biggest energy explorer, posted a 38.5 percent
increase in first-quarter profit after rising crude prices
compensated for a decline in production.  Net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 16.7
billion rupees ($195 million), or 3.89 rupees a share, from 12.1
billion rupees, or 2.81 rupees, a year earlier, the Islamabad-
based company said in a statement to the  stock exchange  today.
Sales rose to 39.5 billion rupees from 31.8 billion rupees.  “A decline in production was compensated for by the
increase in the average price of gas and oil,” said  Shahbaz Ashraf , a research analyst at Arif Habib Ltd. in Karachi, who
has a “sell” recommendation on the stock. The average price at
which the company sells gas price rose 25 percent and oil prices
rose 5 percent, he said.  Demand for energy in Pakistan is three times supply,
according to government estimates. Daily electricity outages
have forced textile and engineering factories to shut and caused
riots across the country. The government has increased gas
prices to encourage exploration and help meet future demand.  Oil & Gas shares fell 0.1 percent to 152.55 rupees at 3:30
p.m. local time on the Karachi Stock Exchange. The share has
 risen  38 percent this year. The company plans to pay a mid-year
cash dividend of 1.50 rupees a share, according to the
statement.  “The oil price outlook is encouraging for the company as
we estimate the average crude price will be around $80 a barrel
this year, around $10 higher than last year,” Ashraf said.
“That will help the company to improve profit further.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
