Cash premiums for soybeans at export
terminals near New Orleans this month rose relative to Chicago
futures as farmers slowed sales, betting that prices will
continue to climb. Corn premiums also gained.  The spot-basis  bid , or premium, for soybeans delivered in
October rose to 52 cents to 58 cents a bushel above November
futures, compared with 47 cents to 55 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. The  average spot price  rose
to $12.74 a bushel, the highest level since July 2009.  “The farmer, once he gets the harvest done, is going to
tuck it away in the bin and slam door the shut,” said  Scott Stoller , a grain merchandiser for Michlig Agricenter Inc. in
Manlius, Illinois. Farmers “are not willing sellers of the
rally right now,” he said.  The oilseed rose to a 16-month high in Chicago today.
Farmers may hold out on selling, expecting prices to keep
climbing because demand is increasing in  China , Stoller said.  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 1.25 cents to
close at $12.19 on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the
most-active January contract touched $12.36, the highest level
since June 2009.  Corn premiums rose to 57 cents to 62 cents above December
futures, the USDA said. That compares with 57 cents to 58 cents
yesterday.  Futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $5.71 a bushel. The most-active contract is up 38
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
