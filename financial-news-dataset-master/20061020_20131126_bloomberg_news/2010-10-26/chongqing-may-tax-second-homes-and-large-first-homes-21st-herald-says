The Chinese city of Chongqing may
impose a property tax on second homes and large first homes, the
21st Century Business Herald reported today, citing an
unidentified government official familiar with the situation.  Second home buyers must pay 0.3 percent of the property
value of the home, the report said. First homes that are larger
than 200 square meters will be taxed as well, the newspaper
reported, citing the official.  The property tax trial awaits approval from the State
Council, the newspaper said, citing Liu Wei, head of local
finance bureau.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
