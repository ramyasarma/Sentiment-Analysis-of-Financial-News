The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in Germany. Stock
symbols are in parentheses, and share prices are from the
previous close.  The benchmark DAX Index fell 0.4 percent to 6,613.8.  Continental AG  (CON GY): French rival Michelin & Cie., the
world’s second-largest tiremaker, reported a 24 percent increase
in third-quarter sales helped by demand from truck makers and
logistics companies in Europe and South America. Continental’s
shares dropped 1.1 percent to 63.73 euros.  Deutsche Bank AG  (DBK GY): Germany’s biggest bank reported
a third-quarter loss of 1.21 billion euros ($1.67 billion) after
writing down the value of its holding in Deutsche Postbank AG.
That compares with the median analysts’ estimate of 1.52 billion
euros. The bank said on Sept. 21 it would report a loss because
of a 2.3 billion-euro charge related to Postbank. The shares
retreated 1.6 percent to 41.19 euros.  Deutsche Boerse AG  (DB1 GY): Europe’s largest exchange
operator by market value may report lower third-quarter profit
of 151 million euros, down 4.6 percent from a year earlier, amid
subdued trading and increased competition from alternative
trading systems. The exchange will post results after the close
of European markets today. The shares shed 0.9 percent to 51.80
euros.  Kontron AG  (KBC GY): The maker of miniature computers for
slot machines and drone aircraft reported an 81 percent jump in
third-quarter profit to 5.6 million euros as incoming orders
rose. The shares added 0.4 percent to 7 euros.  Krones AG  (KRN GY): The world’s biggest maker of bottling
and packaging equipment reported nine-month after-tax profit of
31.9 million euros as sales increased. That compares with a loss
of 25.4 million euros a year earlier. The shares lost 0.9
percent to 42.01 euros.  Praktiker AG  (PRA GY): Germany’s second-biggest home-
improvement retailer reported third-quarter net income of 11.7
million euros, up from 9.8 million euros a year earlier. Net
sales declined as an “anticipated pickup of international
business failed to materialize,” the company said. The shares
advanced 0.6 percent to 6.78 euros.       SAP AG  (SAP GY): The biggest maker of business-management
software reported a 12 percent rise in third-quarter profit to
501 million euros as corporations revived spending. The company
also reiterated its outlook for 2010. The shares rose 0.3
percent to 38.30 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
