Kot Addu Power Co. , Pakistan’s
biggest non-state electricity producer, posted a 52.4 percent
increase in first-quarter profit, after gains from an
appreciating U.S. dollar.  Net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to 2.03
billion rupees ($23.7 million), or 2.31 rupees a share, from
1.34 billion rupees, or 1.52 rupees, a year earlier, the Lahore-
based company said in a filing to the  Karachi Stock Exchange 
today. Revenue fell to 16.2 billion rupees from 20.3 billion
rupees.  Private power producers sell electricity to state-run
distributors, charging in U.S. dollars, according to an
agreement with the government, said  Muniba Saeed , research
analyst at Invest Capital & Securities Ltd., in Karachi, who has
a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  Pakistan’s rupee declined 1.1 percent against the dollar
during the three months ended Sept. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell over 4 percent in the
previous 12 months.  Kot Addu shares rose 2.24 percent to 41.02 rupees at 9:32
a.m. in Karachi. The stock gained 45 percent last year compared
with a 60 percent increase in the  benchmark  Karachi Stock
Exchange 100 index. The share has  fallen  11.3 percent so far
this year.  “Another reason behind the increase in profit is the
higher interest income due from the government on delayed
payments for power purchases, Saeed said.  Other income, including interest from delayed payments,
rose to 1.9 billion rupees from 806 million rupees a year ago,
according to the statement.  Kot Addu operates a 1,600 megawatt plant that’s capable of
using furnace oil, diesel and natural gas to generate
electricity, which is sold to the state-run Water & Power
Development Authority, according to the power company’s Web
site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
