Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. ,
the nation’s biggest copper producer, reported a lower-than-
expected 5 percent increase in the second-quarter profit because
of higher costs.  Net income climbed to 10.1 billion rupees ($227 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 9.59 billion rupees a year
earlier, the unit of  Vedanta Resources Plc  said today in a
statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The average profit
estimate of 22 analysts complied by Bloomberg was 11 billion
rupees. Sales fell 1 percent to 60.3 billion rupees.  Prices of zinc and aluminum on the London Metal Exchange
gained an average 15 percent in the quarter from a year earlier,
while copper prices rose 24 percent. Input costs, mainly
electricity expenses, surged as coal prices rose 31 percent to
an average $94 a metric ton in the quarter, according to
researcher McCloskey Group Ltd.  Sterlite Industries  shares  fell as much as 2.3 percent to
168.65 rupees and traded at 171.50 rupees as of 2:16 p.m. in
Mumbai. The stock has fallen 21 percent this year, compared with
a 16 percent advance in India’s key Sensitive Index.  The company has sought intervention by the nation’s top
court against an order by a lower court asking Sterlite to
shutter its only copper smelter at Tuticorin in the southern
Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The Supreme Court in an interim
order on Oct. 18 allowed the smelter to operate until the middle
of December.  Hindustan Zinc Ltd., the nation’s largest producer of the
metal and a unit of Sterlite, reported a 1.5 percent gain in
second-quarter profit on Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
