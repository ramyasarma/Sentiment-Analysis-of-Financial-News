Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, hired Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. as coordinator to refinance $3.15 billion of credit
lines, a person familiar with the matter said.  Taqa plans to get a new revolving credit facility with
three- and five-year portions to replace a line that expires
next year, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the information is private.  “We have started the process of refinancing our $3.15
billion revolving credit facility,” Britta Hallbauer, a
London-based spokeswoman for Taqa, said today in an e-mailed
reply to Bloomberg. She declined to elaborate.  Abu Dhabi-based Taqa agreed to pay interest of 65 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate on money
drawn from its existing credit signed in 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Moody’s Investors Service ranks Taqa’s debt A3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
