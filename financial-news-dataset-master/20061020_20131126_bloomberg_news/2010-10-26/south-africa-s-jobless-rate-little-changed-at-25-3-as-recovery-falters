South Africa, which has the highest
 unemployment rate  of 62 countries tracked by Bloomberg, shed
more jobs in the third quarter, undermining the recovery of the
continent’s biggest economy.  The number of people with work fell by 86,000 to 12.98
million, leaving the jobless rate at 25.3 percent, little
changed from the previous three months,  Statistics South Africa 
said in a report released in Pretoria today.  “There has been stagnation in the labor market,” Kefiloe
Masiteng, an official in charge of labor data, said in an
interview. Many people are so discouraged they are “no longer
looking for work,” he said, with the percentage of people in
work or seeking a job dropping to 54.2 percent from 54.7 percent
in the second quarter.  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  will give details of a plan
to create 5 million jobs over the next decade when he presents
his mid-term budget tomorrow,  Collins Chabane , minister in the
presidency, told reporters today. The growth strategy will
reduce the unemployment rate to 15 percent, he said, compared
with a previous target of 14 percent by 2014.  “The new growth path is intended to address unemployment,
inequality and poverty in a strategy that is basically reliant
on creating a significant increase in new jobs in the economy,
mainly in the private sector,” Chabane said in the capital,
Pretoria.  Economic Growth  Gordhan said on Oct. 21 that the economy needs to expand 7
percent a year in order to meet the government’s jobs and
poverty goals. The economy grew an annualized 3.2 percent in the
second quarter.  The jobs survey shows that more than 60 percent of
unemployed people in South Africa haven’t had jobs for a year or
longer.  The biggest job losses were in the financial services
industry, where employment fell by 98,000 to 1.6 million, the
statistics office said. Mining lost 12,000 jobs, while
manufacturing gained 8,000 and the construction industry added
27,000.  Job losses totaled 870,000 last year as the economy fell
into its first recession in 17 years. Unemployment is the
“number one factor that we have to tackle,” central bank
Governor  Gill Marcus  said on Sept. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
