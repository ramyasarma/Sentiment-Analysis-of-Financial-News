Mexico’s peso dropped for a second
day ahead of the central bank quarterly inflation forecast that
will come after consumer prices rose in the first half of this
month.  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 12.4146 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.3612 yesterday. The decline pared
the currency’s gain to 5.5 percent this year.  “It will be very important tomorrow to see what new
trajectory policy makers will have for inflation tomorrow,”
said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City. “One day the markets are optimistic about the
Fed’s announcement about quantitative easing and the next they
are worried about inflation.”  Mexico’s central bank will release the quarterly inflation
expectations report tomorrow at 1 p.m. New York time. Annual
inflation quickened to 3.89 percent in the first half of October
from 3.7 percent in September, according to the central bank.
Inflation was below the central bank’s forecast range of 4.75
percent to 5.25 percent.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S Bernanke  has said the Fed
may buy more assets to help spur growth.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.399 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.56 centavo to
133.41 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
