Bank Millennium SA , the Polish unit
of  Banco Comercial Portugues SA , reported a third-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates as it set aside less money to
cover bad loans.  Net income was 76.3 million zloty ($27.1 million), compared
with a loss of 87 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based
bank said in a regulatory statement today. Profit exceeded the
70.2 million-zloty  average projection  of eight  analysts  surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Loan-loss provisions dropped 68 percent to 50.7 million
zloty. Net interest income rose 26 percent to 239.1 million
zloty as the bank increased its net interest margin to 2.36
percent from 2.12 percent. Millennium also had a “positive”
margin on deposits, it said. Net fees climbed to 135.4 million
zloty from 122 million zloty a year earlier.  The lender, which raised 1.06 billion zloty in a share sale
this year, is targeting a return on equity of 15 percent in 2012
and a cost-income ratio of less than 60 percent, compared with
the current 64.1 percent. Millennium said it aims to control 7
percent of Poland’s retail banking market and about 5 percent of
the corporate market within two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
