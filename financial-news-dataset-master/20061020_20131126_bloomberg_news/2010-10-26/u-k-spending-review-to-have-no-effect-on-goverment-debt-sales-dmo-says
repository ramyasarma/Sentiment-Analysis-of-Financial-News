The U.K. spending review, announced
by the government on Oct. 20, will have no effect on debt sales,
according to  Robert Stheeman , chief executive officer of the
Debt Management Office.  “Last week’s spending review more or less confirms” the
numbers first outlined in June, Stheeman said in an interview
today in Brussels. “There is no reason for us to revise our
numbers, especially in regards to the cash borrowing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
