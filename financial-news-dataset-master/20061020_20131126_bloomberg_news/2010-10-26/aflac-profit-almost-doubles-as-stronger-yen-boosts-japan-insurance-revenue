Aflac Inc. , the world’s largest
seller of supplemental health insurance, said third-quarter
profit almost doubled as a stronger yen magnified revenue from
Japan and the firm posted an investment gain.  Net income increased to $690 million, or $1.46 a share,
from $363 million, or 77 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer said today in a
statement. Results included $6 million in realized investment
gains, compared with a $226 million loss a year earlier.  Aflac gets most of its  revenue  from policies supplementing
work and government health insurance in Japan. The Bank of
Japan, seeking to weaken a currency that reached a 15-year high
versus the dollar, sold yen last month in the first such move
since 2004. The yen strengthened against the dollar to 83.53 at
the end of September from 89.60 a year earlier.  “We are especially pleased with Aflac Japan’s results for
the third quarter,” Chief Executive Officer  Daniel Amos  said in
the statement. “We remain confident in the strength of our
balance sheet and capital position.”  Aflac fell 6 cents to $55.19 at 4:03 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The insurer, which reported results
after the close of regular trading, has climbed more than 19
percent this year. The 24-company  KBW Insurance Index  has also
risen about 19 percent this year.  Operating income, which excludes some investment results,
was $1.45 a share, beating by six cents the average  estimate  of
19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales in Japan  Sales of new policies in Japan rose 16 percent to 34.6
billion yen ($403 million). The stronger yen boosted operating
earnings per share by 7 cents in the quarter, Aflac said.  Aflac had “confidence to resume” share repurchases after
building capital eroded by writedowns, Amos said in August. The
insurer, which suspended buybacks in 2008, will repurchase as
many as 3 million shares in the fourth quarter and 6 million to
12 million shares next year, Amos said.  Aflac increased its quarterly dividend on Aug. 10 by 7.1
percent, to 30 cents from 28 cents. The dividend is payable Dec.
1 to shareholders of record on Nov. 17.  Michael Zuna  was promoted to chief marketing officer this
month after  Jeffrey Charney  left to take a job at auto insurer
Progressive Corp. Aflac is known for a talking duck that touts
the company’s coverage in television advertisements.  Shareholders’ equity, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, improved to $11.1 billion as of Sept. 30 from $10
billion at the end of June on unrealized gains on securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
