The Swedish krona erased its gains
against the euro and the dollar after the nation’s central bank
said it won’t need to raise interest rates as much as previously
estimated in the coming years.  The krona weakened 0.2 percent to 9.2131 per euro as of
9:32 a.m. in Stockholm, after appreciating to 9.1577. The
Swedish currency slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar to
6.5948.  The Riksbank also increased its main rate by a quarter
percentage point to 1 percent. The rate decision was predicted
in a survey of economists by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
