Urban Brands Inc., the bankrupt
purveyor of large-size women’s apparel, is being acquired by
Gordon Brothers Group.  In an auction lasting 21 hours, Boston-based Gordon
Brothers beat bids from Rainbow USA Inc., Monomoy Capital
Partners LLC and Versa Capital Management, lawyer  Lawrence Gottlieb  said today in a telephone interview. Gottlieb, who
represented the retailer’s creditors, couldn’t immediately
comment on the price.  Urban Brands, based in Secaucus, New Jersey, operates more
than 200 stores under the Ashley Stewart brand and sought
bankruptcy protection in September. At the time, GB Merchant
Partners LLC, a unit of Gordon Brothers, submitted a so-called
stalking horse bid, which establishes a minimum offer.  Gordon Brothers, known for store closings and appraisals,
has purchased bankrupt companies including Polaroid Corp. and
Linens n’ Things, often partnering with other companies.  The case is In re Urban Brands Inc. 10-13005. U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
