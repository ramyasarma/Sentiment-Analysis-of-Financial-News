Corn rose for a second straight day
on speculation that the U.S. government will reduce its crop
estimate next month. Soybeans also gained.  Changing expectations by farmers contributed to a
surprising cut in a corn-production forecast this month, the
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Prices jumped to a
two-year high on Oct. 13 on mounting speculation that the USDA
will lower its outlook again in its next report on Nov. 9.  “People are looking for a further cut in U.S. corn
production, and that will force end-users to increase
purchases” as inventories shrink, said  Greg Grow , the director
of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to close at $5.71 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of trade. The price, which rose 33 percent in the third
quarter, touched $5.88 on Oct. 13, the highest since August
2008.  On Oct. 8, the USDA cut its corn-crop estimate for the
second time in as many months, predicting a 3.4 percent drop
from 2009. U.S. reserves before the next harvest were forecast
to fall to the lowest since 1997.  While predicting the biggest soybean crop ever, the USDA
said the total will be 2.2 percent less than forecast in
September.  ‘Selling Every Bushel’  “Even with a record soybean crop, we are selling every
bushel, led by Chinese demand,” Grow said.  The Asian nation’s imports of the oilseed in October will
be 65 percent more than the same month last year, the China
National Grain & Oils Information Center said on Oct. 21.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at $12.31 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the
commodity touched $12.36, the highest level since June 2009. The
commodity, used to make animal feed and cooking oil, has gained
36 percent since July 1.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion last
year, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
