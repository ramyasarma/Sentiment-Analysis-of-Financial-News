Corn fell from near a two-year high
and soybeans dropped from 16-month peak as a stronger dollar
reduced investment demand for some commodities.  The dollar rose as much as 0.8 percent against a basket of
six major currencies, making U.S. grain less appealing for
overseas buyers.  Hedge  funds increased bets on higher soybean
prices by 12 percent last week to a record, government data
show. Speculators held the third-biggest bet on rising corn
prices.  “The dollar’s rally is shifting speculative money out of
the grain markets,” said  Greg Grow , the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
“The dollar rebound is providing an incentive to cut long
positions,” or bets on higher prices, Grow said.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $5.6725 a bushel at 10:08 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The price, which rose 33 percent in the third quarter,
reached a two-year high of $5.88 on Oct. 13 after the government
reduced its estimate of this year’s U.S. crop.  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 4 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $12.26 a bushel on the CBOT. Yesterday, the
commodity reached $12.255, the highest price since June 2009.
Before today, the oilseed, used to make animal feed and cooking
oil, rose 36 percent since the end of June.  Corn rose to a record $7.9925 on June 27, 2008, and
soybeans reached an all-time high of $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
