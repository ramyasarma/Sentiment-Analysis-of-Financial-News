Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA  may seek
to refinance 6.5 billion euros ($9.1 billion) after the merger
of its parent company, Weather Investments, and VimpelCom Ltd.,
Il Messaggero reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Wind Chief Executive Officer  Luigi Gubitosi  met with 11
banks including Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG in
London yesterday, according to the Italian newspaper. The deal
would be structured in two parts: 3 billion euros to refinance
bank debt and a 3.5 billion-euro senior bond sale to pay off
maturing bonds, Il Messaggero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
