Amlak Finance PJSC , the Islamic
mortgage company being reorganized by the United Arab Emirates
government, reported its first quarterly profit this year as it
set aside less money to cover bad loans.  Net income was 5.99 million dirhams ($1.63 million) in the
third quarter, compared with a 44.6 million-dirham loss a year
earlier, according to a statement posted on the Dubai Financial
Market website today. Impairment charges for Islamic loans and
investments in the period declined to 17.7 million dirhams from
44 million dirhams.  Amlak and rival  Tamweel PJSC , once the U.A.E.’s two largest
mortgage companies, stopped lending after the seizure of global
credit shut their access to funds. Shares of the two companies
were suspended in November 2008 after the federal government
began work on a plan to merge the two companies.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC , the U.A.E.’s biggest Islamic
lender, in September boosted its stake in Tamweel to 57 percent
from 21 percent as part of a plan to revive lending. The planned
merger has now been abandoned and a federal government committee
is still working on Amlak’s reorganization.  Dubai, a trade and financial-services hub in the Gulf Arab
region, allowed foreigners to buy homes in some parts of the
emirate in 2002, spurring a building boom. Demand evaporated in
2008 after the credit crisis dried up mortgage lending, sparking
a more than 50 percent plunge in home prices in the city.  Amlak said operating income fell 8.1 percent to 160.5
million dirhams, while operating expenses dropped 38 percent to
29.3 million dirhams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
