China should resist pressure from
the U.S. and Europe to let its currency appreciate, Wang Yong, a
central bank researcher wrote in a commentary in Shanghai
Securities News today.  The Asian nation should not increase holdings of U.S. or
European government bonds as long as pressure remains, Wang
wrote in the commentary.  China should also avoid raising interest rates again this
year because doing so would attract speculative “hot money”
into the currency, Wang, a professor at the People’s Bank of
China’s training school in Zhengzhou city, wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
