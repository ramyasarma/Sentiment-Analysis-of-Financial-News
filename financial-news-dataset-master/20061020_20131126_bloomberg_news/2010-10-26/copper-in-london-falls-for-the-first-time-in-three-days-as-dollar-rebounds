Copper declined for the first time
in three days as the dollar rebounded, dimming the appeal of
commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.5
percent to $8,472 a metric ton, before trading at $8,480 a ton
by 8:01 a.m. in Singapore. Copper reached a 27-month high of
$8,549 a ton yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
