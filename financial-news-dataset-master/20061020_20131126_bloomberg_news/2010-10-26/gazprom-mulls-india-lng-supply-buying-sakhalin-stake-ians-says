(Corrects second paragraph to show Rosneft owns project
stake.)  OAO Gazprom is considering supplying
liquefied natural gas to India in exchange for the 20 percent
stake in the Sakhalin-1 project held by state-owned Oil &
Natural Gas Corp., the Indo-Asian News Service reported citing
 Stanislav Tsygankov , the head of foreign relations at the
Russian company.  OAO Rosneft and India’s ONGC own 20 percent each of the
project controlled by Exxon Neftegas Ltd. and Japan’s Sakhalin
Oil & Gas Development Co., which hold 30 percent apiece,
according to the IANS report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
