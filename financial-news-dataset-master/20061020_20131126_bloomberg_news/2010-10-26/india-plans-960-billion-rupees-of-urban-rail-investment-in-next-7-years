India, the world’s second-most
populous nation, estimates 960 billion rupees ($22 billion) will
be spent on urban railways by March 2017, as expanding cities
stoke demand for public transportation.  To raise part of that, the Indian government will form a
fund that invests in city rail systems, Navin Kumar, a secretary
in the  Ministry of Urban Development , said at a New Delhi
conference today. He didn’t provide further details.  Mumbai and the southern cities of Bangalore and Chennai
have begun building rail networks to ease congestion and support
rising populations. India’s  economic growth  may help boost the
nation’s urban populations to 590 million in the next two
decades from 340 million in 2008, McKinsey & Co. said in a
 report  in April.  India is “a big opportunity” for trainmakers, said Rajeev
Jyoti, who heads  Bombardier Inc. ’s transportation business in
India. “The demand for mass-transit systems is significantly
higher” than previously.  Montreal-based Bombardier opened a factory in India in 2008
after winning a contract to supply New Delhi’s subway operator.
The factory builds 32 subway cars a month, Pierre D. St-Onge,
the plant’s general manager, said last week.  New Delhi has a 180-kilometer-long urban rail network in
operation. Part of the system runs underground.  India will need 35 rail-based transit systems in cities
over the next two decades, according to McKinsey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
