Spain sold 3.2 billion euros ($4.5
billion) of Treasury bills, less than the maximum target of 4
billion euros for its regularly monthly auction.  Spain’s Treasury sold 1.69 billion of three-month bills at
an average yield of 0.951 percent, compared with 0.685 percent
when the securities were last sold on Sept. 28. It also sold
1.49 million of six-month bills, at 1.29 percent compared with
1.18 percent last month. Demand for the three-month paper was
2.77 times the amount sold, compared with 2.99 times in
September, and 2.08 times the longer-dated bills, up from 2.01
last month.  Spain is raising taxes, cutting public workers’ wages and
freezing pensions to trim its  budget deficit , which is set to be
the second-largest in the euro region this year at 9.3 percent
of gross domestic product. Next year it aims to lower the
deficit to 6 percent of GDP, in line with France’s projected
shortfall, with a budget bill that passed a first ballot in
Parliament last week after the minority government forged deals
with opposition lawmakers.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
benchmark  bonds  instead of German equivalents fell 5 basis
points to 156.1 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
