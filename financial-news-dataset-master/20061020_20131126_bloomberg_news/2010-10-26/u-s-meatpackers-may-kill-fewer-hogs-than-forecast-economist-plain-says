University of Missouri livestock
economist  Ron Plain  reduced his forecast for the U.S. hog
slaughter in 2011 because of rising feed costs.  Meatpackers will process 110.2 million hogs next year, up
0.5 percent from an estimated 109.6 million in 2010, Plain said
today in an interview in Chicago. Plain, who works at the
university’s Columbia campus, said that he had forecast a 1.1
percent increase.  Corn is “no longer cheap,” Plain said. The cost of the
grain has surged 38 percent this year. Hog kills still will
increase because the industry remains profitable, he said  “We made good money this year,” Plain said. “It’s going
to be a profitable year, so we’re going to have a few more hogs
next year.”  Hogs in Iowa and Minnesota will range from $73 to $76 per
carcass hundredweight, Plain said. The negotiated base price
will be $73 per carcass hundredweight in 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
