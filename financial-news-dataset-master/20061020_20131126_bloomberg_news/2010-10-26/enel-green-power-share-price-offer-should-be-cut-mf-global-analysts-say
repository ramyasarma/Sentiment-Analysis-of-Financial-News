Enel Green Power SpA shares should
be sold at a price below the current marketing range of 1.8
euros to 2.1 euros, MF Global analysts said in a note to clients
today.  The shares are valued fairly at 1.9 euros and should be
sold at a discount to guarantee gains to investors, the analysts
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
