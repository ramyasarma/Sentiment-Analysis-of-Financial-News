U.S.  gasoline  demand fell 1.7
percent last week, the largest week-to-week decline since Sept.
10,  MasterCard Inc.  said in its SpendingPulse report.  Motorists bought an average 9.1 million barrels of the fuel
a day in the week ended Oct. 22, the second-biggest payments
network company said.  Consumption fell 2.7 percent from a year earlier, the sixth
decline in seven weeks. The four-week average for the period was
down 1.3 percent from a year earlier, the fifth consecutive
drop.  The year-to-date gain in demand moderated to 0.5 percent
from 0.6 percent the prior week.  Demand  slipped from the prior week in all seven geographic
regions. Fuel use dropped 2.8 percent in New England, 2.4
percent in the Central Atlantic, 2 percent on the West Coast,
1.7 percent in the Midwest, 1.6 percent in the Rocky Mountains,
1.4 percent in the Lower Atlantic and 1.2 percent on the Gulf
Coast.  The highest demand this year was 9.71 million barrels a day
in the week ended May 28, boosted by motorists filling their
tanks before the May 31 Memorial Day holiday. The lowest was
8.84 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 10.  The  average pump price  for regular gasoline was unchanged
at $2.82 a gallon, up 8.5 percent from a year earlier. The price
peaked this year at $2.91 on May 7.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc.  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
