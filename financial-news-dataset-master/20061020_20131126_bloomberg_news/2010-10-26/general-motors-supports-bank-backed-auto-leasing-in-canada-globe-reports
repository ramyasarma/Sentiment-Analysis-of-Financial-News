General Motors Co.’s Canadian unit
is in favor of allowing banks to offer vehicle leasing,
reversing a previous stance, the Globe and Mail reported.  The support could lead to regulatory changes in next year’s
review of the Bank Act by the federal government, the  newspaper 
said.  GM, along with the domestic units of Mazda Motor Corp.,
Nissan Motor Co. and others, say consumers would benefit from
additional choices and potentially better pricing, the Globe
reported. The Canadian units of Ford Motor Co. and Honda Motor
Co. are among the automakers opposed to the move, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
