Coffee futures rallied to a 13-year
high in New York on concern that global supply will be tight.  Output from the next crop in Brazil, the world’s biggest
producer, may drop to 36 million bags, the lowest in four years,
after a drought hindered flowering, the nation’s coffee council
said on Oct. 22. Costa Rica lowered its output estimate by 3.5
percent for the season that began this month, Reuters reported,
citing the head of the coffee association.  “First Brazil and now Costa Rica, everyone is lowering
their estimates,” said  Tom Mikulski , a senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “People are concerned
about the supply of better-quality coffee.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery gained 1.25 cents, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $2.0175 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the commodity rose to $2.046,
the highest level since August 1997.  Mikulski said he expects prices to reach $2.10 a pound.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery rose
$16, or 0.9 percent, to $1,879 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
