Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. , South
Africa’s second-largest grocer, said all stores will stay open
should the Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union carry
out a strike on Oct. 29 over pay and benefits.  “We have received formal notice that they are going on
strike,” Neal Quirk, operations director at Cape Town-based
Pick n Pay, said in a phone interview late yesterday. “We are
putting all contingencies in place so that we trade can as
normally as possible. All stores will trade.”  More than 27,000  employees  will take part in the walkout in
a dispute over wages, meal and uniform-cleaning allowances and
long-term employment incentives, the union said yesterday in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
