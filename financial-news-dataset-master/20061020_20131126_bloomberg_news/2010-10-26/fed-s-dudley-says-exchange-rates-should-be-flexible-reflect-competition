President  William Dudley  said currencies should reflect the
strength of their nation and be allowed to fluctuate.  “The key is to have exchange rates that are flexible
enough to reflect underlying competitiveness,” Dudley said
today in response to audience questions after a speech in
Rochester, New York.  In order for “rebalancing” to take place between emerging
markets and developed nations, there needs to be “a little more
exchange rate flexibility,” he said. Dudley declined to take
questions about monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
