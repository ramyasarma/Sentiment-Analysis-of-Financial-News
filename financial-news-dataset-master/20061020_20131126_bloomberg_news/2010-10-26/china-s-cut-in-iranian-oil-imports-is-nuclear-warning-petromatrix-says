A reduction in China’s imports of
crude oil from Iran may be a “warning sign” regarding the
Middle Eastern country’s pursuit of nuclear technology,
according to consultants  Petromatrix GmbH .  China cut crude imports from  Iran  in the period from
January to September compared with a year ago even as the
world’s biggest energy consumer shipped in more oil, Petromatrix
said. It decreased supplies from Iran to 415,000 barrels a day,
from 499,000 a day last year, Petromatrix said, citing data from
the Beijing-based Customs General Administration.  “It might be a first warning sign,”  Olivier Jakob ,
Petromatrix’s managing director, said in a telephone interview
from Zug, Switzerland. “China is still importing a lot. It
might be showing to Iran, ‘you’re not going to participate in
our growth.’”  The United Nations in June passed a fourth round of
sanctions against Iran that restrict financial transactions. The
U.S. on July 1 passed additional sanctions targeting fuel
importers and banks, and European Union governments followed by
banning investment and sales of equipment to Iran’s oil and
natural-gas industries.  BP Plc said today it’s too early to know whether its North
Sea Rhum natural-gas field venture with Iranian Oil Co. U.K.
Ltd. will shut because of European Union measures against the
Middle Eastern nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
