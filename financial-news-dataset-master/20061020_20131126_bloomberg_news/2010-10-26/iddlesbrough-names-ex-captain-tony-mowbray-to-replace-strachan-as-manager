Middlesbrough soccer club named
former captain Tony Mowbray as manager as the team tries to exit
the relegation zone of England’s second division.  Mowbray, who played 10 years with the team, replaces Gordon
Strachan, who left “by mutual consent” on Oct. 18. Mowbray, a
former defender, won the manager of the year award from the
Scottish Football Writers Association in his first year at
Hibernian and was the English coach of the year with West Brom
in 2008. He’s also managed Celtic, where he replaced Strachan in
mid-2009.  The team has 11 points out of a possible 39 and after 13
matches is in 22nd place in the Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
