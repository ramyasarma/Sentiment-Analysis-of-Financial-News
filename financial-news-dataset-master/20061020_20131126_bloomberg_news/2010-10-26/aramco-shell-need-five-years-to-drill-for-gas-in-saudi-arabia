A joint venture between  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc  and Saudi Aramco will take five years to finish its
second exploration period for natural gas in Saudi Arabia’s
southern Rub Al Khali desert.  South Rub al-Khali Co. will drill three new wells in the
greater Kidan area, the venture known as SRAK said by e-mail
today. Kidan lies near the Saudi border with the United Arab
Emirates.  SRAK said yesterday it achieved “good” results from the
seven wells it drilled over the past three years in the Rub Al
Khali area as part of the first exploration period. SRAK said
it’s too early to say when results will be available from the
second exploration period, which started on July 26.  SRAK is one of four ventures exploring for natural gas in
Saudi Arabia, which holds the fifth-largest gas reserves in the
world. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company,
said it will soon start looking for gas near the Saudi-Kuwaiti
border.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
