Apollo Group Inc.  received a request
from U.S. regulators for information on the education company’s
insider trading policies, sending shares down.  The Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement division
asked for the information, Phoenix-based Apollo said in a
 regulatory filing . The company fell 34 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$36.10 at 9:41 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.  Apollo, the biggest education company by enrollment and
operator of the University of Phoenix, disclosed in October 2009
that the SEC was asking about the company’s revenue recognition
practices. Investors are likely to react negatively to the news
that the SEC was seeking new information,  Jeffrey Silber , an
analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients today.  “It appears the inquiry has been somewhat broadened,
likely lengthening the timeframe of any ultimate resolution,”
Silber said in the note.  To contact the reporter of this story:
