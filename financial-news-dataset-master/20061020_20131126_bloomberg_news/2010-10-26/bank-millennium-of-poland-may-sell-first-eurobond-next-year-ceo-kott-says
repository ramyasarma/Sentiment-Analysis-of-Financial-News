Bank Millennium SA , the Polish unit
of  Banco Comercial Portugues SA , may sell its first Eurobonds
next year to obtain funding in foreign currencies.  “We are sounding out the market,” Chief Executive Officer
 Boguslaw Kott  told reporters in Warsaw today. “I’d like to do a
Eurobond issue next year but not at all cost.”  Millennium today reported a third-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as it set aside less money to cover bad
loans. Net income was 76.3 million zloty ($27.1 million),
compared with a loss of 87 million zloty a year earlier. It
exceeded the 70.2 million-zloty average projection of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The stock weakened 0.8
percent to 4.94 zloty as of 11:16 a.m. in Warsaw.  State-controlled  PKO Bank Polski SA , Poland’s largest
lender, this month sold 800 million euros ($1.11 billion) of
five-year bonds in its first offering of debt in the common
European currency. The yield on the note that carries a 3.733
percent coupon has risen to 4.11 percent from 3.83 percent on
Oct. 14, according to prices on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
