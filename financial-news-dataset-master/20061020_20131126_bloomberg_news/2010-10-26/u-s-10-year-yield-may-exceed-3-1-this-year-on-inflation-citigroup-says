The 10-year Treasury  yield  may rise
to as high as 3.2 percent by year-end and “much higher” in
2011 as further monetary easing by the Federal Reserve increases
expectations for faster inflation, Citigroup Inc. said.  Longer-term bond yields are poised to rise, widening the
 gap  between short- and long-term rates, analysts led by New
York-based  Tom Fitzpatrick  said in a note to clients, citing
technical patterns and historical parallels. Ten-year bond
yields have broken above a channel top at 2.54 percent and the
55-day moving average, Citigroup said. If the advance is
sustained “preferably” on a weekly closing basis, yields may
next target “major resistance” near 3.10 percent and then the
200-day moving average near 3.21 percent, the bank said.  “The market has become almost blindly one dimensional and
complacent,” Fitzpatrick wrote along with London-based  Shyam Devani  and New York-based  Alex Good  in a note yesterday. “The
whole world rises and falls now on the back of the Fed and QE2.
We struggle to see how this is healthy or how it can end well.”  Central bank buying of bonds is called quantitative easing,
or sometimes QE2 because it will be Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke’s second attempt at using the strategy.  Benchmark 10-year yields advanced 0.08 percentage point to
2.64 percent yesterday, the highest closing level in more than a
month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 2.625
percent security due in August 2020 traded at 99 29/32 as of
2:09 p.m. in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data.  Yield Forecast  Two-year  bond yields have climbed six basis points from the
record low of 0.3270 on Oct. 12. Citigroup predicts the advance
will meet resistance at 45 to 48 basis points and then near 60
basis points. A rise in two-year yields would not signal a move
in the Fed funds rate until it climbs to the 1 percent to 1.5
percent level, the bank said.  “In the nearer term our concerns about the longer end of
the curve would suggest a danger of some curve steepening first
as the Fed deliberately falls behind the curve and enters QE
2,” the analysts wrote.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
