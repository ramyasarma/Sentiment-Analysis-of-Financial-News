dividend of 20 euro cents a share after reporting lower full-

in 2010 from 23.3 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based
company said in a statement, citing preliminary figures. Pretax
profit of 28.6 million euros compared with the firm’s target of
“significantly more than 25 million euros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
