California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  said the most populous U.S. state will receive
$902 million in additional federal funds to help build high-
speed passenger-train service.  The funds from the Federal Railroad Administration are on
top of a $2.3 billion grant to the state in January as part of
federal stimulus efforts, said Andrea McCarthy, a spokeswoman
for Schwarzenegger. Details of the funds will be announced by
the U.S. Transportation Department later this week, she said,
without elaborating.  “As the nation’s largest infrastructure project,
California’s high-speed rail system will create hundreds of
thousands of new jobs, reduce pollution, boost economic growth
and link Californians from one end of this great state to the
other,” Schwarzenegger said today in a  statement .  California’s push for a bullet-train network, which the
state forecasts to cost more than $40 billion, comes as the
state tries to reduce a 12.4 percent jobless rate and curb
greenhouse gas emissions from cars and airplanes.  State voters approved a $10 billion bond sale in 2008 to
help fund construction of the 800-mile rail network that is to
operate trains between San Francisco and Sacramento in the
northern part of the state to Los Angeles and San Diego in the
south.  Rachel Wall, a spokeswoman for the  California High-Speed
Rail Authority , wasn’t immediately available to comment.
