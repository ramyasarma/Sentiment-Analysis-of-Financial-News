China may be vulnerable in seeking
to defend its restraints on the export of rare earths or other
commodities because of conditions it accepted when joining the
World Trade Organization in 2001, a former WTO judge said.  While the trade arbiter’s rules let nations tax exports and
safeguard natural resources, China signed pledges that it would
only tax or limit exports from a list of specific raw materials,
said  James Bacchus , a lawyer at  Greenberg Traurig LLP  in
Washington. WTO rules prohibit export quotas, he said.  “What makes China vulnerable is the accession agreement it
signed” to join the WTO, Bacchus, who was chairman of the WTO’s
appellate body, told reporters today at a conference on rare
earths in Washington.  China, the source of more than 90 percent of the world’s
rare earths used to make disk drives, wind turbines and smart
bombs, announced cuts in production in July, prompting calls
from Germany, Japan and the U.S. to restore exports.  A separate case the U.S. filed against China on its limits
to the export of raw materials used in steel production may set
the legal precedent for a complaint on rare earths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
