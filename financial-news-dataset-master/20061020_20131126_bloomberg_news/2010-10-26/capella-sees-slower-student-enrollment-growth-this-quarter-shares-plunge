Capella Education Co ., the
Minneapolis-based provider of more than 1,000 online college
courses, forecast slower enrollment after reporting a third-
quarter profit increase of 38 percent. Shares fell 17 percent.  Net income rose to $13.5 million, or 80 cents a share, from
$9.78 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. Enrollment is expected to increase 16 to
17 percent in the fourth quarter, below analysts’ expectations.
 Amy Junker , an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee,
said she had expected 25 percent growth.  For-profit colleges are under pressure because of proposed
regulations from the U.S. Department of Education that would
crack down on high-pressure sales practices. Enrollment growth
is slowing as Capella faces a “challenging external market
environment”  Steve Polacek , senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said in a statement.  The size of the anticipated fourth-quarter slowdown
“definitely came as a surprise to us,” Junker said. “We were
not anticipating that.” Investors expected Capella to be less
affected by the rules because of its focus on higher-end
graduate programs, she said.  Capella fell $11.61, or 17 percent, to $55.73 at 9:35 a.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Before
today, the shares have declined 11 percent this year.  Enrollment Results  Capella offers bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees in
fields such as business, health and education.  Third-quarter enrollment increased by 26 percent from a
year earlier, to 38,634, the company said, after rising 32
percent in the previous quarter. The company on July 27
projected enrollment and revenue would increase 24 to 25.5
percent in the third quarter. Third-quarter revenue rose 26
percent to $105 million, from $83.6 million a year earlier,
Capella reported.  Revenue should rise 20 to 22 percent in the fourth quarter,
the company said. Based on the company’s forecast, revenue
should reach $113 million to $115 million, instead of the
expected $119 million, and per-share earnings would be $1.06 to
$1.12, below analysts’ consensus estimate of $1.18, Junker said  On Oct. 13,  Apollo Group Inc. , the biggest for-profit
education company, withdrew its forecast for the year ending
next Aug. 31, citing regulatory scrutiny and a possible 40
percent decline in new students. An index of 12 education stocks
plunged 18 percent the day after Apollo’s forecast. Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat, is investigating for-profit colleges’
recruitment practices, program quality and use of government
funds.  About 80 percent of Capella students are enrolled in
master’s degree or Ph.D. programs and are mostly employed adults
looking to move up in their careers, said Capella chief
executive officer J.  Kevin Gilligan  during a Sept. 23
presentation to investors. That differentiates Capella from most
competitors that focus on students at the associate or bachelor
degree level, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
