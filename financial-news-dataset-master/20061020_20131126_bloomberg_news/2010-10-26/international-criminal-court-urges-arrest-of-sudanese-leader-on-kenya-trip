The International Criminal Court
urged Kenya to arrest Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir if he
travels to Kenya to attend an Intergovernmental Authority for
Development meeting scheduled for Oct. 30.  Bashir is wanted by the ICC to face allegations of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Darfur, the
Hague-based court commented in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
