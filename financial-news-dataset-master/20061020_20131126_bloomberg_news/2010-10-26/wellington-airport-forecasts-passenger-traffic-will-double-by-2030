Wellington International Airport
Ltd., majority owned by  Infratil Ltd. , forecast passenger
traffic will double in the next 20 years as more travelers from
the Asia-Pacific region visit New Zealand.  Traffic is expected to grow at an average rate of 3.4
percent a year, reaching 1,000 passengers an hour by 2030, the
airport’s Chief Executive Officer  Steven Fitzgerald  said at a
media briefing yesterday before the opening of a new terminal.  The airport, New Zealand’s third-busiest, expects growing
economies in the Asia-Pacific region will fuel a 4.5 percent
annual increase in overseas passengers using its new NZ$39
million ($29 million) international terminal.  “Growth in the international economies New Zealand relies
on and the long-term GDP projections are higher” for global
than domestic traffic, Fitzgerald said in a phone interview.  The airport maintained 4.5 percent passenger growth through
the financial crisis, he said. It currently handles 5.2 million
passengers a year, including 600,000 overseas travelers.  The new terminal, three separate structures encased in
1,600 square meters (17,200 square feet) of copper sheeting and
collectively known as “The Rock,” more than triples departure
lounge space, Fitzgerald said.  The airport raised its landing charges 2.85 percent in July
2007 for five years to fund the NZ$60 million two-stage
development, which included refurbishment of existing
infrastructure and customs and security areas.  Wellington International Airport is 66 percent owned by
Infratil, a Wellington-based investor in power companies and
airports.  To contact the reporter for this story:
