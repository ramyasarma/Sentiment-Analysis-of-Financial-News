PayPal Inc. , the online-payments
processor owned by  EBay Inc. , introduced a mobile version of its
checkout software today as it tries to capitalize on surging
smartphone use.  The company, holding a  conference  in San Francisco to
promote its service to mobile-phone and Web developers, also
unveiled a cheaper way for businesses to handle transactions of
less than $12, such as a 99-cent digital song or a single
newspaper article.  As more commerce moves to phones and social networks,
PayPal is racing against  Visa Inc.  and MasterCard Inc. to earn
the loyalty of programmers. Its developers, who began building
PayPal applications on smartphones, televisions and websites
last year, have generated $1 billion in payments volume for the
company. Mobile commerce will grow sixfold to $119 billion by
2015, according to ABI Research in Oyster Bay, New York.  “Developers are basically taking PayPal out to places
PayPal hasn’t been before,” said Nate Gilmore, vice president
of marketing and business development at  Shipwire Inc. , a Palo
Alto, California-based company that helps merchants store and
ship products. “This does for commerce application development
what online banking did for consumers or what the ATM did for
banking.”  Facebook’s Role  Facebook Inc., the world’s biggest social-networking
company, endorsed the new technology at the conference.  Sheryl Sandberg , Facebook’s chief operating officer, said her company
will use PayPal to pay its developers and adopt the new version
on the site.  PayPal estimates it controls about 10 percent of the online
payments market, ranking behind Visa and MasterCard. It
generated $22.4 billion in payments volume last quarter and
accounts for  37 percent of total revenue  at San Jose,
California-based EBay. PayPal is outstripping growth at its
parent company, which expects online payments eventually to
become its biggest business.  PayPal gave developers more access to its software last
year, letting them build PayPal apps across the Web. The
platform, called PayPal X, has attracted 50,000 programmers and
1,000 applications.  Mobile Payment  Its mobile express checkout, which has been tested by
companies such as  Nike Inc.  and Buy.com Inc., will become
available to all merchants, PayPal said. The micropayments
product will let merchants collect low-dollar purchases until a
certain volume is reached, at which point PayPal will charge a
single processing fee.  That helps businesses lower their costs. Processing fees
for items less than $12 typically account for a large percentage
of the purchase price, making it unattractive for merchants to
accept credit cards.  Visa, the world’s biggest handler of payments, said
yesterday that it will give developers free tools to build
applications on a variety of devices through its Authorize.net
platform. Visa is afraid of losing developers to PayPal, said
 Bill Smead , an EBay investor who oversees $160 million at Smead
Capital Management in Seattle.  “If Visa doesn’t get them now, they will be gotten by
PayPal,” he said.  Under President  Scott Thompson , PayPal has forged
partnerships with Microsoft Corp. and International Business
Machines Corp. to help developers build payments apps.
Yesterday, PayPal bolstered its management team, hiring Sitel
Corp.’s Patrick Dupuis as chief financial officer. EBay Chief
Executive Officer  John Donahoe  said last year that he was open
to the idea of spinning off PayPal someday.  “We saw as early as last fall PayPal was going to take a
leadership role in mobile commerce,” said Scott Schwarzhoff,
 vice president  of marketing at  Appcelerator Inc. , which helps
businesses such as MTV and Budweiser build mobile apps. “We’re
enabling them to go a heck of a lot faster into mobile than they
can on their own.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
