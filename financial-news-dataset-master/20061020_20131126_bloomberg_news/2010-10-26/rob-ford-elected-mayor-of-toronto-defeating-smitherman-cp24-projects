Rob Ford , a Toronto councilor who
campaigned on pledges to cut spending, was elected the 64th
mayor of Canada’s biggest city, topping challenger  George Smitherman .  Ford received about 47 percent of the votes cast, to 35
percent for Smitherman, with more than 98 percent of the polls
reporting, according to the city’s election  website.   Ford, 41, has  vowed  to curb Toronto’s spending, which he
says increased 56 percent to C$9.2 billion ($9.02 billion) in
the past 10 years. He’s pledged to cut the number of city
councilors in half to 22, a move that will save about C$9
million a year in direct costs. He also wants to reduce the
expense accounts of politicians.  “People are really fed up with the wasteful spending,”
Ford said in an interview on CP24 Television from his home
today. “I want to thank them for their vote of confidence, and
I can’t wait to put an end to this gravy train.”  Ford said that his first act as mayor will be to eliminate
a car-registration tax.  Opinion polls showed that the two leading mayoral
candidates were almost tied as recently as last week. An  Angus Reid  poll  released  Oct. 18 showed Toronto residents voting 41
percent in favor of Ford, 40 percent for Smitherman, 48, a
former deputy premier of Ontario, and 16 percent for  Joe Pantalone . The survey, conducted Oct. 14 and Oct. 15 among 1,001
adults, has a margin of error of 3.1 percent, 19 times out of
20.  Debt Rally  Toronto’s debt is rated AA by Standard & Poor’s, the
company’s second-highest rating. The city’s debt burden may
climb to about C$4.2 billion by 2013, a 56 percent increase from
2008, according to S&P.  The city’s 5.2 percent debentures maturing June 1, 2040
have returned 12 percent this year, according to Bloomberg data.
That compares with an 8.5 percent total return for the broader
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Canadian Provincials & Municipals
Index.  Toronto, which hosted the Group of 20 nations summit in
June, has a population of 2.48 million people, according to the
city’s  website .  Ford replaces  David Miller , who announced last year he
wouldn’t seek another term after holding the office since 2003.  In other municipal election results across Ontario today,
former member of provincial Parliament Jim Watson became mayor
for a second time in Ottawa, Canada’s capital. Watson received
49 percent of the vote with 81 percent of the votes tallied,
according to the city’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
