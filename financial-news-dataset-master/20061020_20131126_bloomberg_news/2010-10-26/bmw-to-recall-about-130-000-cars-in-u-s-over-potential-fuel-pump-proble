Bayerische Motoren Werke AG has
notified the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its
intention to conduct a voluntary recall of “some” model year
2007-2010 BMWs equipped with twin-turbo inline six-cylinder
engines. All of them contain BMW’s High Precision Injection
direct fuel injection system, the company said in an e-mailed
statement, citing the risk of a failure of the high-pressure
fuel pump.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
