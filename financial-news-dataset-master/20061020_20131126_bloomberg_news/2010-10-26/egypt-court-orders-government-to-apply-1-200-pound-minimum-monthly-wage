An Egyptian administrative court has
ruled the state must implement a minimum monthly wage of 1,200
Egyptian pounds ($208) for all workers, enforcing a decision by
another court in March, Judge Kamal El Lamei said today.  The ruling applies to public and private workers in the
Arab world’s most populous nation. The government will likely
challenge the decision, due to an inability to raise the pay of
the millions of workers it employs and its desire to promote
Egypt as a top investment destination based on the abundance of
cheap labor, analysts said.  “The National Council for Wages needs to play a bigger
role in determining and implementing a minimum wage,” Magdy
Sobhi, deputy director of Al Ahram Center for Political and
Strategic Studies, said of the government body established in
2003. “As it stands, it will be impossible for the government
to abide by this ruling,”  The government respects judicial rulings and will determine
its course of action after studying the court’s decision,
cabinet spokesman  Magdy Rady  said by telephone.  Egypt’s most recent official minimum wage was set in 1984
at 35 pounds a month. The public sector workforce of 5.5 million
constitutes 22 percent of the country’s total employment,
according to a report this week by the  International Monetary
Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
