The dollar and the pound may rebound
from an initial drop, should the U.S. and U.K. central banks
increase asset purchases, because the quantitative-easing
measures won’t boost lending, High Frequency Economics said.  The expectation that increased bond buying by the Federal
Reserve and Bank of England will ease monetary conditions
“should lead to a one-time decline in the currencies,”  Carl B. Weinberg , chief economist in Valhalla, New York, wrote in a
research note today. “In fact, the impact of QE on the dollar
and the pound should reverse when traders finally realize that
credit will still be tight in the United States and Britain,
even after another dose of QE.”  The dollar was little changed against the euro at $1.3972
and the pound was also little changed, at 88.71 pence per euro,
as of 7:03 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
