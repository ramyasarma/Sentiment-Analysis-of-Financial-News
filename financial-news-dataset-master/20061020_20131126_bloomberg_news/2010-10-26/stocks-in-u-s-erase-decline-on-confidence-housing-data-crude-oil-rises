U.S. stocks erased losses as
consumer confidence topped estimates and a government report
showed home prices unexpectedly rose in August. The Dollar Index
retreated from its high of the day and oil reversed declines.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent to
1,184.88 at 10:22 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 0.7
percent earlier. The Dollar Index, which gauges the currency
against six major peers, climbed 0.5 percent after rallying as
much as 0.8 percent. Oil climbed 0.3 percent to $82.73 a barrel.  The Conference Board’s confidence index increased to 50.2
from a revised 48.6 in September, figures from the New York-
based research group showed today. The proportion of people who
said jobs were plentiful fell to the lowest level this year and
income expectations were the weakest since April 2009. The
Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a separate report that
prices climbed 0.4 percent in August, defying economists’ median
forecast for a decrease.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
