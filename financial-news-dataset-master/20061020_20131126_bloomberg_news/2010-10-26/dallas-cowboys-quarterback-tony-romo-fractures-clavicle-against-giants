Dallas Cowboys quarterback  Tony Romo 
suffered a fractured left clavicle during tonight’s game against
the New York Giants.  Romo was hurt early in the second quarter when he was
tackled by Giants linebacker  Michael Boley  and landed on his
left side. Romo was replaced by  Jon Kitna  and the team said
tests revealed a fracture to his collar bone.  The Cowboys, who have a 1-4 record this season, didn’t say
how much time Romo might miss. A three-time Pro Bowl selection,
Romo completed five of seven passes for 39 yards and a touchdown
before the injury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
