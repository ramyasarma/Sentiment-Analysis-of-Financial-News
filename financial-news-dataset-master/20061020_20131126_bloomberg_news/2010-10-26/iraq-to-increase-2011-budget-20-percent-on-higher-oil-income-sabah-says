Iraq’s government will today start
to discuss a $86.4 billion draft budget for next year, or 20
percent more than in 2010, As Sabah reported, citing Finance
Minister Baqir Jabr al-Zubaidi.  The budget for 2011 is based on an oil price of $70 per
barrel, Zubaidi told the newspaper.  Iraq’s crude oil exports rose 9 percent in September to
60.6 million barrels, the State Oil Marketing Organization said.  Iraq’s Parliament approved on Jan. 26 an 84.7 trillion-
dinar ($72.5-billion) budget for federal spending this year,
based on an oil price of $62.5 per barrel.  The country’s oil sales will “almost” finance an expected
budget deficit of about $18 billion for 2010, al-Zubaidi said on
June 10. Iraq had a deficit of $19 billion in 2009.  Al-Zubaidi said at the time that Iraq is budgeting to
increase spending to $100 billion by 2013.  Iraq holds the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves, with
its 143.1 billion-barrel reserve behind only Saudi Arabia,
Canada and Venezuela.  Iraq is trying to overcome a legacy of war, economic
sanctions and under-investment in its oil fields. It has awarded
12 oil service contracts and three natural gas licenses, hoping
to boost production of its most prized exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
