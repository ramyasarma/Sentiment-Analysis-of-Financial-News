China has sufficient supplies of
cooking oil and a recent surge in wholesale prices of the staple
won’t significantly impact consumers, website QQ.com reported,
citing Shang Qiangmin, director of the China National Grain &
Oils Information Center.  Prices of cooking oil in China, which have gained about 33
percent since July, may surge more, QQ.com said. Consumers
needn’t hoard oil, Shang was cited by QQ.com as saying.  China’s increasing oilseed imports this year was partly to
boost stockpiles, QQ.com said citing Shang. Still, urbanization
will further cause imports of soybeans to rise in the next 10
years, Shang said according to QQ.com.  China National Grain & Oils Information Center is owned by
the State Administration of Grain, which manages the country’s
food supply and logistics.  -- William Bi . Editors: Richard Dobson, Jarrett Banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
