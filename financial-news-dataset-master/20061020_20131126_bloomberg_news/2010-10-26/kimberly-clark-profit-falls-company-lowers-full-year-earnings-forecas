Kimberly-Clark Corp. , the maker of
Huggies diapers and Viva paper towels, posted a 19 percent drop
in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings
forecast on higher materials costs and lower demand from other
businesses.  The stock fell the most in almost two years. Net income
declined to $469 million, or $1.14 a share, from $582 million,
or $1.40, a year earlier, the Dallas-based company said in a
statement. Twelve analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated
 average  profit of $1.28 a share.  Profit was trimmed by lower demand in the professional
services unit, which sells brands such as Kleenex and Scott
toilet paper to workplaces, currency devaluation in Venezuela
and rising materials costs. Chief Executive Officer  Tom Falk  has
cut costs, eliminating about 3 percent of the company’s jobs
last year, and expanded health-care and professional revenue to
lessen reliance on raw materials such as wood pulp.  “The challenging business environment weighed on our
bottom-line results more than we previously expected, with
relatively soft market demand, cost inflation and slightly
higher competitive spending,” Falk said in the statement.  Kimberly-Clark expects pulp prices to remain about the same
next year, Falk said during the company’s earnings call today.
The inflation in the previous quarter was the highest ever, the
company said.  Sales advanced 1.3 percent to $4.98 billion in the third
quarter. Analysts predicted sales of $4.99 billion on average.  The company lowered its full-year profit  forecast  to as
little as $4.60 a share, from a previous minimum of $4.80. The
company earned $4.52 last year.  Kimberly-Clark said earlier this year it expected commodity
costs to rise in 2010.  The shares fell $3.86, or 5.8 percent, to $62.61 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest
decline since December 2008. They have dropped 1.7 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
