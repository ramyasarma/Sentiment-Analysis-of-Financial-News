Zenith Bank Plc , Nigeria’s biggest
lender by market value, said nine-month profit more than doubled
as provisions for bad debts declined and income from loans
increased.  Net income surged to 31.1 billion naira ($207 million) in
the period ended Sept. 30 from 11.1 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based bank said in an e-mail today.  Net interest income, the money banks make from interest
charges on loans, rose 2 percent to 63.2 billion naira, Zenith
said. Provisions for loan losses plunged to 2.04 billion naira
from 26.1 billion naira, it said.  “Barring unforeseen circumstances, this trend would be
improved upon considerably in the remaining period of the
financial year,” the company said, without providing any
further information.  Earnings at banks in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous
nation, are recovering after a debt crisis last year led the
country’s central bank to fire the chief executive officers of
eight lenders and inject 620 billion naira into the industry to
avoid a financial collapse.  Zenith  wasn’t one of the banks that
were bailed out.  Zenith’s shares rose for a third day, adding 2.4 percent to
13.99 naira on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The stock has
advanced 29 percent so far this year, outperforming a 20 percent
gain in the benchmark  All Share index .  “We would expect the market to be reassured by these
figures,” CSL Stockbrokers Ltd., a Lagos-based brokerage that
has a “neutral” rating on the stock, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
