Copper may fall in New York as the
dollar strengthens and the highest prices in more than 27 months
discourage buying from China, the world’s largest consumer of
the metal.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, rose as much as 0.4 percent. A stronger
U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals more expensive in terms
of other monies and saps demand for commodities as an
alternative investment. Copper today touched $3.893 a pound, the
highest level since July 7, 2008, in New York.  “In the case of copper, it’s probably the high price
that’s curbing demand,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “Besides that, it’s the usual
suspects like the dollar.”  December-delivery copper fell 0.7 cent, or 0.2 percent, to
$3.856 a pound at 8:02 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Copper for
delivery in three months dropped 0.5 percent to $8,476 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange. Lead and zinc reached the
highest prices since January on the LME.  “A dollar rally might place pressure on base-metal
prices,”  Anthony B. Rizzuto , a New York-based analyst at
Dahlman Rose & Co., said in a report yesterday.  China’s Economy  The dollar index’s 14-day relative strength index, a gauge
of whether a currency or commodity is overbought or oversold,
this month fell below 20. Some analysts and traders who study
technical charts view readings below 30 as a sign that prices
may be poised to rebound.  Rizzuto also said concern about the economy in China, the
world’s largest metals user, resurfaced last week as the
government implemented further measures to curb inflation. The
People’s Bank of China raised the one-year lending rate by 0.25
percentage point to 5.56 percent.  “We believe that the Chinese government is taking the
right steps in preventing the economy from overheating,”
Rizzuto said.  Copper premiums in China fell by a third in the past week
as surging prices curbed purchases by end-users. Premiums paid
by Chinese importers over the LME cash price dropped to around
$80 a ton on a cost, insurance and freight basis to Shanghai,
said Zhu Shiwei, an analyst at Yong’an Futures Co. That compares
with $120 a ton quoted at the start of the month, he said.  Scrap Prices  Similarly, prices have slid on the Chinese scrap market as
demand weakened over the past three months, Robert Stein,
president of the non-ferrous division of the Bureau of
International Recycling, said in an interview yesterday.  In Chile, the world’s largest copper-producing nation,
unions at Anglo American Plc and  Xstrata Plc ’s Collahuasi mining
unit called on workers to reject a wage offer, setting the stage
for a possible strike at the fourth-biggest copper mine.
Employees will vote tomorrow on the proposal.  “Heightened expectations of mine strike activity in South
America and declining exchange stockpiles are likely to see
funds add to already high long positions,” Australia and New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. analysts led by  Mark Pervan  in
Melbourne said in a report today.  LME copper  stockpiles  declined for a fourth day to 367,475
tons, exchange figures showed. Orders to draw copper from LME
inventories fell 1 percent to 28,425 tons.  Lead, Zinc  Lead for three-month delivery on the LME reached $2,610 a
ton, the highest intraday price since Jan. 11, and zinc touched
$2,638.75 a ton, the highest level since Jan. 7. Shenzhen
Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Co., China’s third-largest zinc
producer, suspended output at its biggest smelter on Oct. 21
after breaches of environmental rules.  Lead was last down 0.6 percent at $2,570 a ton, and zinc
rose 0.9 percent to $2,587 a ton. Refined zinc production was
1.064 million tons in August, below demand of 1.095 million
tons, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group said today.
Lead output was 791,300 tons, exceeding demand of 789,100 tons,
it said.  Tin fell 1.1 percent to $26,600 a ton. Prices reached a
record $27,338.50 on Oct. 14. The metal has jumped 57 percent
this year, leading gains on the LME, after production was
disrupted in Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Aluminum slid 0.5 percent to $2,362 a ton and nickel fell
1.2 percent to $23,285 a ton.  To contact the reporter on the story:
