JSW Steel Ltd., India’s third-
biggest producer, posted a 15 percent gain in second-quarter
profit after increasing its output to meet demand from
automobile companies.  Group  net income  climbed to 3.73 billion rupees ($84
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 3.23 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today in a
statement. Sales rose 25 percent to 59.1 billion rupees.  The Indian automakers’ association doubled its forecast for
car-sales growth to 23 percent this fiscal year as rising
incomes and new models prompted drivers to buy a record number
of vehicles for a third straight month. The government estimates
steel consumption in India may rise 10 percent in the year to
March, boosted by record auto sales and higher spending on new
roads and power plants.  Contract prices of the key ingredients used in steelmaking
gained in the quarter, with iron ore doubling and coking coal
surging 73 percent. Total costs during the period rose to 53.3
billion rupees from 40.1 billion rupees.  The company’s  shares  fell as much as 2.2 percent to
1,212.60 rupees and traded at 1,221.60 rupees as of 3 p.m. in
Mubai. The stock more than quadrupled in 2009 and has climbed 14
percent this year.  JSW’s raw material costs rose to 35 billion rupees in the
quarter from 27.7 billion rupees a year earlier. The company
buys all of its coking coal from overseas and about 80 percent
of its iron ore needs.  JSW Steel is considering putting its overseas coal and iron
ore assets into a unit for a share sale to fund expansion, two
people familiar with the plans said on Oct. 13. The new unit may
control coal and iron ore mines in the U.S. and Chile, as well
as an exploration business in Mozambique.  To contact the reporter for this story:
