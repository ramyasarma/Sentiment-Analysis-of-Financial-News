Boston Properties Inc. , the biggest
U.S. office real estate investment trust, said third-quarter
earnings excluding items fell after interest  expenses  rose.  Funds from operations declined to $150.8 million, or $1.07
a share, from $158.5 million, or $1.13, a year earlier, the
Boston-based REIT said in a statement today. The company was
projected to have FFO of $1.03, according to the average
 estimate  of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The company’s interest costs climbed after it sold notes to
raise money for purchases of prestigious  properties  in its
favorite markets, said  Mitchell Germain , a REIT analyst with JMP
Securities LLC in New York. The capital raising helped put
Boston Properties in a position to buy Boston’s John Hancock
Tower, New York’s 510 Madison Ave. and the Bay Colony Corporate
Center in the Boston suburb of Waltham, Massachusetts, he said.  “The biggest primary driver in the decline in FFO is their
capital markets activity,” Germain said in a phone interview
before the report. “However that capital markets activity has
placed the company in a very envious position. They have what
might be the strongest  balance sheet  in the office sector, or
one of, which has afforded them the opportunity to be active on
the investment front.”  Boston Properties sold $700 million of senior notes in
April and another $700 million in October 2009. The company has
about $3 billion to spend on purchases, Germain estimated.  New York ‘Stress’  The analyst  cut  Boston Properties to “market perform”
from “outperform” on Oct. 18. The company faces “stress” in
New York, its biggest market, from the potential for job cuts in
financial services, he said. The industry is the city’s biggest
private user of office space, accounting for one out of every
three square feet of leases, according to Cushman & Wakefield
Inc.  Interest expenses rose to $97.1 million in the third
quarter from $77.1 million a year earlier, Boston Properties
said. Revenue from base rents rose 6.5 percent to $310.5
million.  The company  projected  FFO of $1.09 to $1.12 a share for the
fourth quarter. That’s higher than the $1.05 average estimate by
16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Boston Properties said it’s
forecasting FFO of $4.20 to $4.40 for all of 2011.  Hancock Tower is likely to yield a 4.3 percent cash return
in 2011, Boston Properties said. The return for the Bay Colony
complex is projected to be 4.4 percent, the company said.  In Manhattan, rents and vacancy rates have been falling.
Landlords were seeking $53.80 a square foot at the end of the
third quarter, down 6 percent from a year earlier, Cushman &
Wakefield said Oct. 5. Vacancy was 10.9 percent, compared with a
five-year high of 11.1 percent a year earlier.  Occupancies Rise  Boston Properties said its Manhattan buildings were 97.6
percent occupied as of Sept. 30, up from 95.4 percent at the end
of 2009. The landlord’s overall portfolio was 93.4 percent
rented, up from 92.4 at the end of last year.  Boston Properties had interests as of Sept. 30 in 145
properties totaling 38.2 million square feet (3.6 million square
meters), almost all in Midtown Manhattan and the Boston,
Washington, San Francisco and Princeton, New Jersey, areas. Its
holdings include Manhattan’s General Motors Building and four
buildings in San Francisco’s Embarcadero Center.  The earnings were released after the close of U.S.
exchanges. Boston Properties fell 86 cents to $89.87 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock is
up 34 percent this year, compared with a 19 percent increase in
the  Bloomberg REIT Office Property Index .  Funds from operations exclude depreciation and other items.
