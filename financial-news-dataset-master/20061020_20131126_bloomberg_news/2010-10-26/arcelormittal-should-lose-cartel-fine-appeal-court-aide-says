ArcelorMittal , the world’s largest
steelmaker, should lose a challenge to an antitrust fine, an
adviser to the European Union’s highest court said.  The fine against three of the company’s units should be
upheld,  Yves Bot , an advocate general at the EU’s  Court of
Justice  in Luxembourg, said in a non-binding opinion today. He
rejected arguments by ArcelorMittal that too much time elapsed
between the time of the violation and the antitrust fine. A
ruling by the court in line with the advice would be a victory
for the European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust
agency, which also filed an appeal.  ArcelorMittal is challenging the decision by the EU’s
antitrust regulator in 2006 to re-open a probe against it and
re-impose a 10 million-euro ($14 million) cartel fine levied on
the units. Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal in 2009 partly won a
first challenge when a lower EU court said two of the units
shouldn’t be held liable, while keeping the total fine the same.  The Brussels-based commission in 1994 fined ArcelorMittal
Luxembourg SA, formerly known as Arbed SA, for antitrust
violations. The EU’s top court in 2003 annulled that decision
based on procedural errors. The commission then opened a new
case and re-imposed a fine.  Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal declined to comment.  The commission decision concerned ArcelorMittal
International SA, formerly known as TradeArbed SA, ArcelorMittal
Luxembourg and ArcelorMittal Belval & Differdange SA, formerly
known as Arcelor Profil Luxembourg SA.  The cases are C-201/09 P, ArcelorMittal Luxembourg v.
Commission, C-216/09 P, Commission v. ArcelorMittal Luxembourg
SA and Others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
