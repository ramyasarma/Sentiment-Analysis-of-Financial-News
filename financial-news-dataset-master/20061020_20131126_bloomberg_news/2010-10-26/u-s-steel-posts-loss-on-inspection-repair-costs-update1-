U.S. Steel Corp. , the country’s
largest producer of the metal by volume, posted a surprise
third-quarter loss after spending $86 million on repair costs
while raw-material prices increased.  U.S. Steel’s  net loss  narrowed to $51 million, or 35 cents
a share, from $303 million, or $2.11, a year earlier, the
Pittsburgh-based company said today in a statement. Excluding a
one-time currency gain and an asset sale, the loss was $1.21 a
share, which compares with an  average estimate  for profit of 23
cents from 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. Steel, which today reported its seventh straight
quarterly loss, said that repair and maintenance costs were
“significantly higher” than in the second quarter.  Iron ore , a
key steelmaking ingredient, averaged $137 a metric ton in the
quarter, up 57 percent from a year earlier, according to Steel
Business Briefing data.  U.S. Steel  dropped  $1.42, or 3.4 percent, to $40.85 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Third-quarter revenue gained 60 percent to $4.5 billion
from $2.82 billion, the company said.  U.S. Steel, led by Chief Executive Officer  John Surma , said
fourth-quarter earnings for its flat-rolled steel business,  the
company ’s largest, will be in line with the third quarter as
lower maintenance and repair costs will be offset by a drop in
shipments and realized prices.  Soaring Costs  The company’s West Chester, Ohio-based competitor  AK Steel
Holding Corp.  also missed estimates. AK Steel posted a third-
quarter  net loss  of $59.2 million, or 54 cents a share, compared
with net income of $6.2 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement. The average of 11 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was for a loss of 38 cents.  “A stubbornly reluctant economic recovery and soaring raw
material costs will continue to challenge us in the near term,”
AK Steel’s CEO  James L. Wainscott  said in the statement.  AK Steel fell 53 cents, or 4 percent, to $12.84 in New
York.  Nucor Corp., the second-largest U.S. steelmaker by volume,
on Oct. 21 posted third-quarter profit that trailed analysts’
estimates.  U.S. Steel  produced  6.62 million tons of steel in the
second quarter and  Nucor  made 4.65 million tons, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
