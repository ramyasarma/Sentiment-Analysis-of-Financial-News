Typhoon Chaba strengthened from a
tropical storm over the Pacific Ocean south of Okinawa and is
forecast to approach the Japanese island within three days, the
U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.  Chaba, the 16th storm of the northwestern Pacific season,
was about 820 kilometers (510 miles) south of Naha, Okinawa at 3
a.m. local time today, the center said in an  advisory  on its
website. The storm had sustained winds of 120 kilometers per
hour and was heading north-northwest at 15 kph, the center said.  The typhoon is expected to strengthen to an upper Category
2 storm, the second-weakest on the five-step  Saffir-Simpson 
scale, with winds of 176 kph within two days, the center said.  Chaba’s eye is forecast to pass to the east of Okinawa
before turning northeast and skirting the coast of southern
Japan. The storm may be about 170 kilometers from the U.S. Navy
base at  Yokosuka , south of Tokyo, in five days, the center said.  Chaba is the name of a tropical flower in Thailand,
according to the Hong Kong Observatory, which  lists  names
assigned to storms in the northwest Pacific.  To contact the reporter on the story:
