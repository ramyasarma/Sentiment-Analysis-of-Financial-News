Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said he ordered a government takeover of the local unit of U.S.-
owned glass manufacturer  Owens-Illinois Inc .  Owens-Illinois, the world’s largest producer of glass
containers, was exploiting workers and damaging the environment,
Chavez said in comments carried on state television late
yesterday.  “The expropriation is already ready of this glass
company,” Chavez said. “What’s it called? Owens-Illinois.
Expropriate it.”  The nationalization is one of several since Chavez’s party
suffered a setback in legislative elections on Sept. 26 and
Chavez promised to deepen his socialist revolution. Perrysburg,
Ohio-based  Owens-Illinois  is on a list of companies the
government plans to take over, Chavez said.  “Owens-Illinois is a company with North American capital
that has been exploiting workers,” he said.  Stephanie Johnston , a spokeswoman for Owens-Illinois,
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Owens-Illinois employs about 22,000 people in 21 countries,
according to the company’s website. Major customers include
Anheuser-Busch,  H.J. Heinz , and SABMiller.  Owens-Illinois fell $1.62, or 5.5 percent, to $28 at 8:15
a.m. in  trading  before the open of the New York Stock Exchange.
The  shares  had declined 9.9 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
