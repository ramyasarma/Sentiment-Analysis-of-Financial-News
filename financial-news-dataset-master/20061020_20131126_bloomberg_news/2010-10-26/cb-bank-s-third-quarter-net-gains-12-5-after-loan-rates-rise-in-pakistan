MCB Bank Ltd. , Pakistan’s biggest
lender by market value, reported a 12.5 percent increase in
third-quarter profit after it raised lending rates and reduced
the amount of funds set aside for loan delinquencies.  Net income rose to 4.55 billion rupees ($53.1 million), or
5.99 rupees a share, from 4.05 billion rupees, or 5.33 rupees, a
year earlier, the Karachi-based bank said in a statement to the
 stock exchange  today. Revenue climbed to 15.4 billion rupees
from 13.5 billion.  Higher interest rates may limit growth in loans but the
bank generated more income on existing lending, said  Mustafa Bilwani , a research analyst at JS Global Capital Ltd. in
Karachi, who recommends investors hold the stock.  Pakistan’s central bank increased its benchmark interest
rate on July 30 for the first time since 2008, raising it to 13
percent from 12.5 percent, amid concern inflation may
accelerate. The central bank had to further increase the
discount rate to 13.5 percent on Sept. 29 following the worst
floods in the history of the nation.  MCB Bank’s interest income rose 12 percent to 13.8 billion
rupees in the third quarter, while its interest expense rose 19
percent during the three months, according to the statement.  MCB Bank  fell  0.8 percent to 202.95 rupees as of 3:30 p.m.
local time on the  Karachi Stock Exchange . The company plans to
pay a mid-year cash dividend of 3 rupees a share, according to
the statement.  “The decline in provisioning against non-performing loans
also added to the profit rise,” Bilwani said.  Pakistan’s  central bank  began requiring lenders to set
aside more funds to cover delinquent loans in October 2007, and
then eased the rules last year. Banks are currently allowed to
use 40 percent of the value of assets provided as collateral to
meet requirements for provisions against defaults.  Provisions against defaults fell to 9.75 million rupees in
the third quarter from 1.13 billion rupees a year ago, according
to the statement.  Net income in the nine months ended Sept. 30 rose to 12.5
billion rupees, or 16.44 rupees a share, from 11.8 billion
rupees, or 15.53 rupees, a year earlier, according to a
statement to the stock exchange. Revenue rose to 44.8 billion
rupees from 42.2 billion rupees.
