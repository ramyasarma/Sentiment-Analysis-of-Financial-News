Connector 2000 Association Inc., a
nonprofit company that runs a South Carolina toll highway, filed
its plan to repay creditors and restructure its debt of more
than $300 million.  The company filed a plan for adjusting its debt and the
terms of its current toll-revenue bonds Oct. 22 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Connector 2000
is a public-private partnership that operates the highway and
issued bonds to finance its construction.  The association, based in Piedmont, South Carolina, filed
for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in June after toll revenue fell short
of projections. Chapter 9 is the section of the bankruptcy code
used by government entities seeking to restructure debt.  South Bay Expressway LP , another developer and operator of
a nine-mile toll road near San Diego, filed a Chapter 11
bankruptcy March 22 to restructure more than $500 million in
debt. The company also sought court protection, citing
unexpectedly low traffic levels on the road and litigation
expenses. That toll road opened in November 2007.  Connector 2000 was formed in 1996 to finance and operate
the  16-mile toll road  known as the “Southern Connector” in
Greenville County. It also built the South Carolina Highway 153
Extension, a feeder road, according to court documents. Original
projections were for the highway to get about 21,000 tolls a day
after it opened. The Southern Connector has logged about 7,500
tolls a day, according to court papers.  State’s Objections  The  South Carolina Department of Transportation  objected to
the company’s bankruptcy filing and sought dismissal of the
case, claiming Connector 2000 isn’t eligible for protection from
creditors under Chapter 9 because it isn’t a municipality,
according to court documents.  Under the Bankruptcy Code, a municipality is defined as a
“political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a
state.”  Connector 2000 officials counter that the firm is an
instrumentality of the state because it’s “a nonprofit
corporation subject to the control” of the state “to issue tax
exempt debt” to finance the highway.  The Department of Transportation’s authority to set toll
rates and approve Connector 2000’s directors is further evidence
of its eligibility as a municipality, the company said in court
filings.  Trial Date  The plan can’t be approved until a judge decides whether
Connector 2000 can seek Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. A trial
on that issue is set for Dec. 6.  The company estimates bondholders are owed about
$328.8 million, according to court documents.  Bondholders, referred to as Series 1998A and Series 1998B
holders, are owed about $237.8 million, the papers show. The
creditors would share $172.1 million in so-called Tier 1 bonds
that would have first priority for repayment under the proposed
plan.  The bonds would mature 2051 accruing interest at
5.8 percent, paid semi-annually in cash. The bondholders also
would get $29.8 million in Tier 2 bonds, which would have
secondary priority for repayment.  Subordinate holders of the Series 1998C bonds, owed about
$90.9 million, would get $4.2 million in Tier 3 bonds if they
support the plan, court papers show. They would get nothing if
they reject the proposal.  Connector estimates about 83.5 percent of its projected net
revenue for each year would be used to make payments on the
Tier 1 bonds. The payments on the Tier 2 bonds would consume
14.5 percent of net revenue, while Tier 3 bonds would use
2 percent.  The case is In re Connector 2000 Association Inc, 10-04467,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of South Carolina (Spartanburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
