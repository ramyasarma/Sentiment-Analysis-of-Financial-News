India’s 10-year  bonds  rose the most
in two months as yields at their highest level in two years
lured investors.  Yields declined on speculation investors will favor safe-
haven assets after the benchmark stock  index  dropped to a one-
week low. Earlier, bonds had fallen as banks had fewer funds to
invest in debt as  borrowing  from the central bank rose.  “Bonds rallied as these are probably good levels to buy,”
said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at Development
Credit Bank in Mumbai. “Selling of equity assets today also to
some extent helped bonds.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, to 8.13 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The price rose 31 paise per 100 rupee face
amount to 97.84.  Lenders borrowed an average of 875.1 billion rupees ($19.7
billion) from the central bank’s repurchase auction window this
week, compared with 634 billion rupees last week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Reserve Bank of India  may increase the repurchase
auction rate, at which it lends to banks, for the sixth time
this year on Nov. 2, ten of the 14 economists said in a
Bloomberg News survey.  India must continue with steps to cool  inflation , currently
at double the “ideal” level, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee 
said yesterday.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, rose two basis points to 6.79
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
