The Russian government may sell
shares of OAO Sberbank on international markets as it offers as
much as 9 percent of the country’s largest lender to investors,
a person with direct knowledge of the plan said.  The government may sell as much as a 4 percent stake on the
domestic market as well as seeking a strategic investor, the
person said in Moscow today.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref  said on Oct.
21 that Russia should sell 3 percent to 4 percent of the bank’s
shares on the market. The government plans to hold on to a
controlling stake in Sberbank for the next five years, Deputy
Finance Minister  Alexei Savatyugin  said on Oct. 21.  Luis Saenz , a London-based director at Otkritie Financial
Corp., said the approval of the bank’s management stock options
program, which is expected in the coming weeks, is one of the
last impediments to launching a depositary receipts program.  Listing depositary receipts would be a positive for
Sberbank’s share price as it would boost liquidity and open up
the state-controlled company to a wider range of investors,
Saenz said by telephone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
