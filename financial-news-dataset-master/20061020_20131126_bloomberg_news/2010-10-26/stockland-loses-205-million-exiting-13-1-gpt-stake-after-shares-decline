Stockland  has sold its 13.1 percent
stake in  GPT Group  at a A$208 million ($205 million) loss, the
company said.  Australia’s biggest diversified property group sold the 243
million shares it owned in its smaller rival for A$2.75 a share
to existing investors, it said in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange today, valuing the sale at A$668 million.
Stockland bought the shares at an average price of A$3.60 in
November 2008, it said.  Sydney-based Stockland bought the stake when GPT was in a
weak financial position and there was potential to use the stake
to buy its retail assets, Managing Director  Matthew Quinn  said
in the statement. “Since we acquired the stake, GPT has
restructured its balance sheet, strengthened its board and
management and there is now little prospect of acquiring
assets,” he said.  Stockland, which last month won agreement to its A$320
million takeover bid for  Aevum Ltd. , now owns 83 percent of
Sydney-based Aevum, according to Bloomberg  data . It now holds a
14.8 percent stake in FKP Property Group, the Australian real
estate company backed by Malaysia’s  Mulpha International Bhd. ,
Bloomberg  data  shows.  Stockland maintained its forecast for 7 percent earnings
per share growth for the year ending June 30, 2011. Deutsche
Bank AG advised the company on the sale.  GPT closed down 2.4 percent at A$2.85 yesterday. Stockland
fell
1.3 percent to end the day at A$3.78.  To contact the reporter on this story:
