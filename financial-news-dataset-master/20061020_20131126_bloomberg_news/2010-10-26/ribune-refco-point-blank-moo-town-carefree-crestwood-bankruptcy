fraud can’t be sued by a bankruptcy trustee for aiding and
abetting the fraud unless they totally abandon the company’s
interests, the New York Court of Appeals ruled on Oct. 21 in a
case arising from the liquidation of  Refco Inc.   The suit was brought by the trustee of the litigation trust
created under the Chapter 11 plan confirmed for Refco in
December 2006. The U.S. District Court on New York dismissed the
suit. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan certified
questions about governing New York law to the New York Court of
Appeals. Although called the Court of Appeals, it is the highest
court in the New York state court system.  The New York court ruled that it was proper to dismiss the
suit because the complaint was “saturated by allegations that
Refco received substantial benefit” from the fraud conducted by
the insiders. The suit faulted the professional firms for
failing to detect the fraud.  The New York appeals court continued a strict reading of a
long-standing defense from common law known as in pari delicto.
The doctrine says that a company or its representative, such as
a trustee, can’t sue third parties when the company itself was
perpetrating fraud. Except in limited circumstances the court
described, it doesn’t matter that the fraud was carried out by
company officers.  For the in pari delicto defense not to prohibit a trustee
from suing, the New York Court of Appeals said that the company
officer “must have totally abandoned his principal’s interest
and be acting entirely for his own” purposes. The court said
that a bankruptcy trustee can succeed only if the “scheme that
benefitted the insider operated at the corporation’s expense.”  The New York court declined to follow the highest court in
New Jersey which went the other way in a similar case.  In the Refco case, the professionals let off the hook
include the law firm  Mayer Brown LLP  and the accounting firm
Grant Thornton LLP. The suit charged the firms and others with
breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting the fraud at
Refco, with the consequent loss of more than $500 million by
Refco customers.  Refco and affiliates filed under Chapter 11 in October
2005, one week after disclosure $430 million was owing by
purported customers secretly controlled by the former Chief
Executive Officer  Phillip R. Bennett , who was given a 16-year
prison sentence for his crimes.  The case is Kirschner v. KPMG LLP, 151, Court of Appeals of
the State of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
