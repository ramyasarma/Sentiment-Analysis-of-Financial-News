Ralph Goodale, the deputy leader for
Canada’s main opposition Liberal Party, said today that BHP
Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion proposed acquisition of Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc. is not an “ordinary” transaction.  Goodale, who was speaking to reporters in Ottawa, also
reiterated his party’s position that Industry Minister Tony
Clement should reject the acquisition under his Investment
Canada review. He added BHP’s purchase should be denied because
the fertilizer is strategically important for Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
