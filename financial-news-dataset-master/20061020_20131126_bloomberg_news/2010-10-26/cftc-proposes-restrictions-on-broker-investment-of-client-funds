The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission moved to restrict what brokers can do with clients’
assets after investments in money-market mutual funds and
government-sponsored entities soured during the global financial
crisis.  CFTC commissioners voted 4-1 today to propose limiting
investments in money-market funds to 10 percent of client assets
and investments in GSE securities to 50 percent. The rule would
stiffen restrictions on what brokers can do with customer money,
or margin, used to back futures contracts.  The commission will take public comment on the proposal
before staff members make any changes. The rule requires a
second vote by CFTC commissioners to become binding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
