Sinovel Wind Co. , a Chinese wind
turbine maker, faces further investigation by the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, which canceled today’s planned
meeting to consider the company’s IPO.  The watchdog needs to probe “certain matters” at Sinovel
before considering permitting the sale of 105.1 million shares
in an initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
the commission said in a statement on its website yesterday
evening, without giving details.  Sinovel, aiming to challenge the world’s largest wind-
turbine maker in five years, plans to sell about 10 percent of
its enlarged share capital to fund 1.7 billion yuan ($255
million) of projects, according to a prospectus released on Oct.
22. Sinovel plans factories and offshore wind projects to
benefit from China’s growing demand for clean energy.  Sinovel mainly makes 1.5- and 3-megawatt wind turbines. It
had production capacity of 3.3 gigawatts at the end of last
year, with 99.6 percent of sales from 1.5-megawatt turbines.  The company has supplied wind turbines to domestic power
companies, including  China Huaneng Group ,  China Guodian Corp. ,
 China Datang Corp. ,  China Huadian Corp.  and project developer
 China WindPower Group Ltd .  The Beijing-based turbine maker said Oct. 15 that it
completed the production of China’s first 5-megawatt prototype,
the nation’s largest, and plans to start producing 6-megawatt
wind turbines in the first half of 2011.  -Wang Ying in Beiing. Editor: Josh Fellman  To contact the reporter on this story:
