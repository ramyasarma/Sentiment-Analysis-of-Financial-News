Hydroelectric reserves in France
fell, reducing supplies of water to generate electricity in
Europe’s second-biggest power market.  Water reservoirs for electricity production slid for a
sixth week, dropping 4 percentage points to 66 percent full at
the start of this week, according to data on the  website  of
Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, a unit of Electricite de
France SA.  Reserves are 4 percentage points higher than last year and
5 points lower than in 2008. France gets about 20 percent of its
power capacity from running water through turbines. Utilities
can retain water for use when demand and prices are higher.  RTE compiles data from generators EDF, GDF Suez SA and
Societe Nationale d’Electricite & de Thermique. The three
companies produce more than 90 percent of French electricity.  To contact the reporters on this story:
