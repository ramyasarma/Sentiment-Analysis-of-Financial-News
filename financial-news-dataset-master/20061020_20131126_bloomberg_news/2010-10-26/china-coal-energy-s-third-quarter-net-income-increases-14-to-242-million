China Coal Energy Co. , a unit of the
country’s second-biggest producer of the fuel, said unaudited
net profit rose 14.2 percent in the third quarter to 1.61
billion yuan ($242 million).  Raw coal production in the first nine months of the year
rose 20 percent to 9.2 million tons, the company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Earnings per share were 0.12 yuan in the quarter.  China Coal in August said it plans to meet a target of
doubling production by 2015 as the world’s fastest-growing major
economy expands. Output will be increased by building mines,
upgrading existing ones and by acquisitions, President Yang
Lieke said.  The Beijing-based miner produced 108.5 million metric tons
of raw coal last year and aims to boost output by 15 million
tons this year, the company said on April 22. The company is
targeting production of 200 million tons in 2014.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
