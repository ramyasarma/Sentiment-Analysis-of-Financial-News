Brazilian  bank lending  expanded at
the fastest pace since June as interest rates charged on
consumer debt fell to a record low, adding to pressures on the
central bank to take steps to cool the economy.  Outstanding credit in Latin American’s largest economy
increased 19.7 percent in September from the same month a year
ago to a record of 1.61 trillion reais ($946 billion), led by a
51.4 percent increase in mortgage lending, the central bank said
in a statement distributed today in Brasilia.  The average interest rate charged on consumer debt fell in
September to a record low of 39.4 percent from 39.9 percent in
August, as banking competition increased and consumers switched
to cheaper loans, such as mortgages,  Altamir Lopes , head of the
central bank’s economic department, told reporters in Brasilia.  Fueled by record credit expansion, domestic demand is
driving Brazil’s fastest growth in more than two decades,
prompting policy makers to boost borrowing costs by two
percentage points since April to prevent overheating. Concern
over the real’s appreciation means the bank may seek to slow
credit growth without further rate increases, said  Neil Shearing 
at Capital Economics Ltd.  “I don’t think the central bank can really raise rates
because of the currency implications,” Shearing, senior
emerging-markets economist at the consultancy, said by phone
from London. “The key may be, instead, increasing reserve
requirements.”  Policy makers can curb credit growth by boosting the
deposits banks must hold at the central bank.  Record Low Rates  Record-low interest rates in the U.S., coupled with signs
of additional easing by the Federal Reserve, helped push
Brazil’s currency to 1.6442 per dollar on Oct. 14, its strongest
level since September 2008.  The real’s rally led the Finance Ministry to triple this
month to 6 percent a tax foreign investors must pay to buy
fixed-income securities in Brazil.  Brazil’s currency fell 0.7 percent today to 1.7070 per U.S.
dollar at 1:30 p.m. New York time. The real has weakened 1.2
percent in October.  Mortgage lending, which accounts for about 7.8 percent of
total lending, rose 3.8 percent to 125.2 billion reais in
September from a revised 121 billion reais in August, the
central bank said. The figure is up 51.4 percent from a year
ago, the fastest rate of increase since December 2009.  Credit rose to 46.7 percent of gross domestic product, from
46.2 percent in August. The average interest rate charged on
credit fell to 35.1 percent, from 35.2 percent in August.  Loan Defaults  The total loan default rate was 4.7 percent in September,
down from 4.8 percent in August. The rate has fallen from 5.9
percent in August 2009. The company default rate was 3.5
percent, down from 3.6 percent in August, and for personal loans
it was 6 percent, down from a revised 6.2 percent.  Retail sales rose a faster-than-forecast 2 percent in
August from a month earlier. September unemployment fell to 6.2
percent, the lowest figure on record.  Policy makers left the benchmark Selic rate at 10.75
percent for the second straight meeting on Oct. 21. The
unanimous decision was forecast by all 51 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Brazilian economists expect the central bank to resume
interest rate increases in April and to lift the Selic to 11.75
percent by June next year, according to the median forecast in a
Oct. 22 central bank survey of about 100 economists.  The yield on interest rate future contracts due January
2012, the most traded on the Sao Paulo stock exchange today,
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 11.34
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
