Lesotho is planning to open a stock
exchange before the end of next year, Finance Minister  Timothy Thahane  said.  This follows the issue of three- and five-year government
bonds last week, and treasury bills in 2008, Thahane told
reporters in Maseru. It is too early to forecast how many
companies will trade shares, Thato Mohasoa, spokesman for the
Central Bank of Lesotho, said by phone today from Maseru.  “These developments will, in turn, pave the way for the
third phase, which would be the establishment of a stock
exchange,” Thahane said.  The southern African nation, surrounded by South Africa,
dropped a plan to set up a stock market in 2000 because there
weren’t enough big companies to join the exchange. Lesotho’s
currency, the loti, is linked to the rand and its gross domestic
product was about $1.3 billion in 2008, according to the Lesotho
 Bureau of Statistics .  Lesotho’s government issued $7.4 million of three-year
bonds and $11 million of five-year bonds on Oct. 20, Thahane
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
