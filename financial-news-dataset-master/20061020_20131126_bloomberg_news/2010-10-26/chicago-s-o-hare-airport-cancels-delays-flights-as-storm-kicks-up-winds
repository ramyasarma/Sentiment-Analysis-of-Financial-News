Chicago’s O’Hare airport halted
departures until 8:30 a.m. local time, forcing cancellations of
more than 125 flights, as high winds from a Midwest storm move
through the area.  O’Hare is the second-busiest U.S. airport and is a hub for
 United Continental Holdings Inc.  and  AMR Corp. ’s American
Airlines. Chicago’s Department of Aviation commented on the
cancellations in an e-mail today.  American has scrubbed 22 flights for its main jet
operations and 36 flights by its Eagle regional unit, said  Mary Frances Fagan , a spokeswoman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based
airline.  Chicago’s Midway airport, where the largest carrier is
 Southwest Airlines Co. , and Minneapolis, a hub for  Delta Air
Lines Inc.,  are both experiencing delays of as long as 45
minutes, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
