Iran began loading fuel into the
core of its first nuclear power station, which is scheduled to
begin generating electricity next year.  The loading process and testing of the plant at Bushehr
will take about two months,  Ali Akbar Salehi , who heads the
country’s Atomic Energy Organization, said today on state-run
 Press TV . The 1,000-megawatt plant will then need to warm up and
is expected to begin producing power at 40 percent of its
capacity in February, he said.  Fuel was transferred to the reactor area of the plant at a
ceremony on Aug. 21 to mark the opening of the Russian-built
facility. Under Iran’s agreement with Moscow-based  Rosatom , the
state-owned Russian company will supply uranium for the plant
and take away spent fuel.  Iran is under international sanctions over its nuclear
program, which the U.S. and many of its allies say is a cover
for developing atomic weapons. Iran rejects the allegation and
says it needs the technology to generate electricity and for
other civilian purposes such as medical research.  Operating the Bushehr reactor may save Iran, the second-
largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, 11 million barrels of crude or 1.8 billion cubic
meters of gas per year, according to the London-based  World
Nuclear Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
