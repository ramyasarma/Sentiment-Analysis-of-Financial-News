Nigeria’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell 7.6 percent to $33.9 billion in the month to Oct. 21,
according to data on the Central Bank of Nigeria  website , as the
bank sold dollars to prop up the value of the naira.  Reserves fell from $36.7 billion the month earlier, the
bank said, and are down from a high of $58.3 billion in March
2008.  “The foreign reserve was partially depleted because the
government struggled to meet huge foreign-exchange demands at
its twice-weekly foreign-exchange market in September,”  Ayo Teriba , chief executive officer of Lagos-based Economics
Associates, said by phone today.  Fitch Ratings lowered its outlook on Nigeria’s BB- rating
to “negative” from “stable” on Oct. 22, concerned about
withdrawals from the excess crude account and a drop in foreign
currency reserves. The decline in reserves increased the risk to
the economy from any renewed drop in oil prices, Fitch said.  The naira gained to 149.54 to the dollar today from 151.33
yesterday.  “The outlook is very bleak if you continue to deplete your
foreign reserves at this rate; there will come a time when you
will have nothing left to cover your imports,” said Babatunde
Obaniyi, an analyst at Lagos-based Afrinvest West Africa Ltd.  Nigeria relies on crude oil exports for about 95 percent of
its foreign currency earnings, according to the Finance
Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
