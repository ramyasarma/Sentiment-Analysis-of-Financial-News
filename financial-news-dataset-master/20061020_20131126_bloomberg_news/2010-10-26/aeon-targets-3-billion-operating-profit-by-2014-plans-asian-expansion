Aeon Co. , Japan’s second-largest
retailer, said it expects annual operating profit to reach 250
billion yen ($3 billion) by February 2014 as it boosts the
proportion it spends on expanding in China and Southeast Asia.  The target  Aeon  set out in a management plan announced at a
briefing today is almost double the 130 billion yen operating
profit the company posted last fiscal year. It also set a sales
goal of 6 trillion yen for the year ending February 2014.  The operator of the Jusco supermarket chain is focusing on
Asian markets including China and Malaysia as consumer spending
in the Japanese economy has stagnated amid falling wages.  Aeon 
has also increased the number of products under its own Topvalu
label, which generates higher  profit margins  than national
brands.  “ Aeon  is perhaps Japan’s best-run bigger supermarket,”
 Edwin Merner , president of Atlantis Investment Research Corp. in
Tokyo, which manages $3 billion, said before the announcement.
Still, the company faces problems including a mature market, and
having many stores in areas where the population is declining,
he said.  The retailer’s shares  fell 0.7 percent to close at 982 yen
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange before the announcement. The stock
has gained 31 percent this year compared with a 9.9 percent
decline for the broader  Topix index .  Aeon  will invest 830 billion yen on opening stores and
renovation in the three years ending February 2014, according to
the plan. The company will allocate 25 percent of that budget in
China and Southeast Asia, up from 8 percent in the previous
three years when it spent a total of 960 billion yen.  Aeon had 94 stores in Malaysia, Thailand and China, as of
Aug. 31, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
