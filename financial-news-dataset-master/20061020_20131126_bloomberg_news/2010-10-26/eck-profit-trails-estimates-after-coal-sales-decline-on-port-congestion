Teck Resources Ltd. , Canada’s
largest diversified mining company, reported third-quarter
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates after it shipped less
coal because of port constraints.  Net income fell 46 percent to C$331 million ($323 million),
or 56 cents a share, from C$609 million, or C$1.06, a year
earlier, the Vancouver-based company said today in a statement.  Profit excluding costs related to the refinancing of debt
and gains from investments, asset sales, derivatives and foreign
exchange was 79 cents a share. That trailed the 89-cent average
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales gained 18
percent to C$2.5 billion from C$2.13.  Teck’s coal sales dropped 3.1 percent to 5.5 million metric
tons, less than the company’s previous guidance of 5.8 million
to 6.2 million tons. The company ships coal from Westshore
Terminals in British Columbia, which Teck said was affected by
congestion and loading problems.  Teck  dropped  33 cents, or 0.7 percent, to C$45.93 at 4 p.m.
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. The shares have advanced 25
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
