Crude oil was little changed after
confidence among U.S. consumers climbed in October from a seven-
month low and the dollar rose against the yen and euro.  Oil rebounded after the Conference Board’s  confidence  index
increased to 50.2 from a revised 48.6 in September. Futures
dropped below $82 a barrel earlier today as the dollar advanced
from its lowest level in 15 years versus the yen on concern
Japan will renew action to weaken its currency. A stronger
dollar curbs the appeal of commodities as an investment.  “The consumer confidence number was both positive and
better than expected,” said  Jason Schenker , the president of
Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant. “This is definitely supportive for the market.
We’ll also continue to keep an eye on the dollar and stocks.”  Crude oil for December delivery rose 3 cents to settle at
$82.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures are
up 4.9 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for December settlement rose 12 cents to
end the session at $83.66 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Prices declined from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased 6.43 million barrels to 371.2 million.
December oil was down 1 cent to $82.53 a barrel in electronic
trading at 4:32 p.m.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the New
York-based Conference Board’s index would climb to 49.9 from a
previously reported 48.5 for September, according to the median
of 75 projections.  Stronger Dollar  The yen weakened to 81.47 against the dollar from 80.81
yesterday, when it touched 80.41, the strongest level since
April 1995. The dollar rose 0.8 percent against the euro at
$1.3855, compared with $1.3965 yesterday.  “We started out lower on the stronger dollar,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New
York. “At around 10 a.m. the market rebounded on the consumer
confidence numbers. Now the market appears to be ignoring the
dollar and has stalled.”  U.S. equities fluctuated as International Business Machines
Corp.’s $10 billion buyback plan and higher-than-estimated
consumer confidence countered results that disappointed
investors at  U.S. Steel Corp . and  Texas Instruments Inc .  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was little changed at
1,185.64 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 0.1
percent to 11,169.46.  U.S. Stockpiles  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
U.S. crude-oil inventories climbed by 1 million barrels last
week, according to the median of 15 responses in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Gasoline supplies climbed by 625,000 barrels, according to
the survey. Supplies of distillate fuel  probably decreased  for a
fifth week as distributors took deliveries before winter and
exports to Europe increased.  The department is scheduled to release its weekly report at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  ConocoPhillips may have power restored at its Linden, New
Jersey, refinery sometime today after an outage that began
yesterday, according to a state official. The plant, located
along New York Harbor, has a capacity of 238,000 barrels a day
and processes mainly light, low-sulfur crude oil, according to
the company’s website.  “Gasoline is getting some support from the Conoco
outage,” Bentz said.  Refinery Work  Crews worked through the night to replace faulty electrical
equipment,  Ed Choromanski , an administrator for air compliance
and enforcement at the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, said in an e-mail. They will attempt to get line
power back, which “may be sufficient to run the refinery,” he
said.  Gasoline futures for November delivery gained 1.67 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to settle at $2.094 a gallon in New York.  The French Senate passed President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
pension bill, paving the way for the minimum retirement age to
increase to 62 from 60. The bill goes tomorrow for a final vote
at the National Assembly. Protests against the plan eased today
as a quarter of France’s oil refinery workers agreed to go back
to work.  Employees at three of France’s 12 oil refineries voted to
return to work yesterday. Almost all of the barricades at
France’s 219 fuel depots have been lifted. Eighty percent of
service stations should be back in business today, Energy
Minister  Jean-Louis Borloo  said.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 360,810 contracts as of 4:33
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 512,723
contracts yesterday, 26 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.4 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
