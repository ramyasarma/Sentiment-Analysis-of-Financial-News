Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ’s third-
quarter profit increased 6.4 percent, topping analysts’
estimates as the drugmaker cut costs. Sales missed estimates
after the U.S. health-care overhaul reduced reimbursements.  Income  from continuing operations rose to $949 million, or
55 cents a share, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit was 59 cents a share,
beating by 6 cents the average  estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Bristol-Myers aims to trim more than $2.5 billion in
expenses by 2012 and has eliminated 15,000 jobs, or 35 percent
of its workforce, since 2007 through firings and divestitures of
nondrug businesses. The company is increasing its research focus
on biotechnology and making acquisitions to replace medicines
facing generic competition in the next two years.  “Revenues were light, but higher gross margin, lower
operating expenses and a lower tax rate more than overcame
this,” said  Timothy Anderson , an analyst for New York-based
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., in a note to investors. “Overall a
fair quarter for the company.”  Bristol-Myers fell 30 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $26.86 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has  gained  23 percent in the past 12 months.  2010 Forecast  Sales rose 0.2 percent to $4.8 billion, missing analysts’
estimates by $131 million. The U.S. health-care overhaul reduced
third-quarter sales by 1.6 percent, and the company faced lower
international reimbursement rates from austerity measures taken
in European government health programs.  Bristol-Myers repeated its 2010 profit  forecast  of $2.10 to
$2.20 a share, excluding some items. It lowered its 2010 revenue
forecast to “low-to-mid single-digit” growth, down from a
forecast of mid-single digits.  Revenue from Plavix, the world’s second-biggest selling
medicine, after New York-based Pfizer Inc.’s Lipitor, rose 6.7
percent from a year earlier to $1.66 billion. Plavix is co-
marketed with Paris-based  Sanofi-Aventis SA . The drug faces
generic competition in the U.S. in 2012.  Marketing, sales and administrative expenses decreased 6.4
percent for the quarter to $892 million, Bristol-Myers said.
Advertising and product promotions decreased 9.8 percent to $231
million. Research and development expenses increased 0.5 percent
to $824 million.  Health Overhaul  The U.S. health-care law  expanded the number of hospitals
serving low-income patients eligible for reduced prices on
medicines, increased discounts to Medicaid and made subsidies
for retirees’ prescriptions taxable.  Third-quarter sales of Abilify, a mood stabilizer, fell 7
percent from a year earlier, to $608 million. Bristol-Myers has
said the U.S. health-law changes will hurt sales of that drug
because Medicaid, the federal and state health program for low-
income people, is cutting rebates.  In the HIV-drug category, Sustiva revenue climbed 9 percent
to $342 million, and Reyataz rose 4 percent to $375 million.
Sales of the hepatitis B treatment Baraclude increased 19
percent to $228 million.  Bristol has been selling off its non-pharmaceutical
businesses, including medical imaging, wound care and infant-
nutrition. The company has used proceeds to buy back shares and
acquire new medicines and drugmakers. The most recent deal was
the $885 million acquisition of Seattle-based ZymoGenetics, a
maker of hepatitis treatments, completed earlier this month.  Continuing operations accounted for all of the company’s
net income of in the current quarter. Last year’s continuing
operations income of $892 million, or 45 cents a share, excludes
$74 million in profit from the Mead Johnson infant-nutrition
business split off by Bristol-Myers last year.  Per-share figures this year were calculated on fewer
shares; Bristol-Myers started repurchasing $3 billion in stock
in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
