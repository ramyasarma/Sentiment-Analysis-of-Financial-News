Brookdale Senior Living Inc.’s  stock 
was halted following a 13 percent surge that triggered a circuit
breaker implemented after the U.S. equity market crash in May.  An order for  100 shares  on the Nasdaq Stock Market drove
the shares up to $21.87 at 11:00:06 a.m. New York time from
$19.32 in the preceding transaction, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The previous trade had been the stock’s official
open and came 90 minutes before the pause occurred.  Brookdale fell 12 percent to $19.22 on the subsequent
 transaction  two seconds later. The stock was down 79 cents, or
3.9 percent, from yesterday’s close at $19.27 as of 11:14 a.m.
in New York. Brookdale said today that affiliates of Fortress
Investment Group LLC sold 13 million shares at $18.76 apiece.  The surge in the stock triggered a curb implemented by U.S.
exchanges after the May 6 stock market crash erased $862 billion
in less than 20 minutes. The pause usually lasts five minutes
for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and  Russell
1000 Index  as well as  344  exchange-traded funds once they rise
or fall at least 10 percent within five minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
