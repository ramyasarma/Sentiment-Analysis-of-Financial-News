Russia is the world’s most corrupt
major economy, according to Transparency International’s 2010
Corruption Perceptions Index, sliding to the 154th spot of 178
countries and placing it alongside Tajikistan and Kenya.  Russia’s ranking makes it the most corrupt among the Group
of 20 nations, with the next-worst performing member Indonesia
in 110th place, according to the index released by the Berlin-
based organization today. Russia placed 146th in the watchdog’s
2009 index of 180 countries, when Indonesia ranked 111th.  While President  Dmitry Medvedev  vowed to combat corruption
when he came to power in 2008, Russians surveyed at the end of
July ranked former president and now Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin’s  inability to deal with the issue during his 10 years in
power as the administration’s biggest failure.  Cases of bribery in the first half of 2010 jumped to 5,708
from 5,633 in the same period of 2009, Prosecutor General  Yury Chaika  said on Oct. 13, adding that a doubling in the number of
officials cleared on corruption charges shows investigators are
failing to build solid cases.  Russians pay bribes totaling $300 billion a year,
equivalent to almost a quarter of gross domestic product,
according to Kirill Kabanov, head of the National Anti-
Corruption Committee. Medvedev’s promises to reduce corruption
won’t succeed unless law enforcement is improved, he said.  “Fighting against corrupt officials means action by law
enforcement bodies, and they are one of the main sources of
corruption,” Kabanov said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
