The  United Nations  General Assembly
voted for the 19th consecutive year to urge an end to the U.S.
trade embargo against Cuba, which the government in Havana has
labeled an “act of genocide.”  The non-binding resolution, adopted by a 187-2 vote with
three abstentions, asks the U.S. to “repeal and invalidate”
the embargo. The trade ban has been in effect since 1962, three
years after  Fidel Castro  seized control of Cuba.  Israel was the only nation to join the U.S. in voting
against the resolution. Palau, Marshall Islands, and Micronesia
abstained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
