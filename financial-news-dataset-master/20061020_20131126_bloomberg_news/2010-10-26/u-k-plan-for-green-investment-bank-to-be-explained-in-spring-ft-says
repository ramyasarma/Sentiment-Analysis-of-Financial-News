The U.K. government will publish
details of its plan for a “green” investment bank in the
spring, the Financial Times reported, citing the Treasury.  “Significant proceeds” from asset sales will go into the
bank and may take the amount available toward 2 billion pounds
(3.2 billion), the newspaper said.  The funds will be used for initial, high-risk, investment
in technologies such as carbon capture and nuclear and offshore
wind-power, the FT added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
