Sugar is in a “Goldilocks economy”
as a possible supply shortage and stronger demand drive prices
toward the highest levels in several decades, said researcher
F.O. Licht.  Macquarie Group Ltd. cut its estimate for the market’s
surplus in the 2010-2011 season by 70 percent to 1.5 million
metric tons in an Oct. 14 report. Demand will increase 2.1
percent as world production rises 5.4 percent, the bank said.
Raw sugar traded in New York reached the highest price since
1981 in February and is now about 7 percent below that level as
it closes in on a fifth monthly advance in a row.  “We are in a Goldilocks economy simply because everything
is pointing to lower supplies in 2010-2011 than everyone
anticipated earlier, while at the same time the demand side has
still to react,”  Christoph Berg , managing director of
Ratzeburg, Germany-based Licht, said Oct. 20 in a phone
interview.  Sugar jumped on concern about a potential drop in supply as
droughts and floods damaged crops in producing nations from
world leader Brazil to Australia. Wheat doubled in two months
this year in Chicago because of adverse weather, corn surged 33
percent in four months, the most in 2 1/2 years, and cotton
reached the highest level in more than a century in New York.  Supply Shortfall?  There is “definitely” a risk of a global sugar shortage
of “a couple of million tons,” according to Berg.  “The weather has been creating a lot of difficulties
around the world, and this could result in production estimates
to be cut further,” he said. “However, at the same time, these
high prices will have an impact on consumption eventually.”  Worldwide sugar production will rise 11.9 million metric
tons to 166.4 million tons this year, Licht predicted on Oct.
12, calling the increase “far lower” than might otherwise have
been expected.  “Even with a 1- to 3-million-ton surplus, you will still
have a very tight market,” Berg said. “It would still need
another year of stronger surplus in order to balance the
market.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.22 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 28.28 cents a pound at 11:17 a.m. London time on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Prices may reach 30 cents, according
to Berg. The sweetener touched 30.4 cents, the highest level
since 1981, in February.  Still, prices might drop back to 25 cents because the
involvement of funds and speculators may “turn the market
fairly quickly,” Berg said. Speculative long positions, or bets
prices will rise, outnumbered short positions by 160,660
contracts on ICE Futures U.S. in the week ended Oct. 19, up 4.9
percent from a week earlier, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
