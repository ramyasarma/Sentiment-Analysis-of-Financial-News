Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-
largest automaker, introduced the Fuga luxury hybrid sedan in
the country, the first model using the company’s own gasoline-
electric technology.  The model will be priced from 5.78 million yen ($71,500) in
Japan and has fuel economy of 19 kilometers per liter (45 miles
per gallon) under the Japanese highway test system, the company
said in a statement today. That compares with  Toyota Motor
Corp. ’s 2.05 million-yen Prius, the world’s best-selling hybrid,
which gets 38 kilometers per liter.  Nissan’s hybrid system uses a lithium-ion battery supplied
by Automotive Energy Supply Corp., a joint venture between
Nissan and NEC Corp. that also makes the battery for the
automaker’s Leaf electric car. Adding production volume by using
the batteries in more models may reduce manufacturing costs for
the Yokohama-based carmaker.  Nissan’s only other passenger-car hybrid model is the
Altima, which uses Toyota’s hybrid system. The company is
introducing the Fuga to boost sales in Japan as the end of a
government subsidy for fuel-efficient vehicles damps
industrywide demand.  Shares in Nissan fell 0.8 percent to 727 yen in Tokyo
trading as of 10:21 a.m. The stock has declined 10 percent in
2010.  Honda Motor Co.  introduced a hybrid version of its Fit
compact on Oct. 8, which is priced from 1.59 million yen and has
fuel economy of 30 kilometers per liter.  Nissan has booked more than 23,000 pre-orders for its Leaf
vehicle, which goes on sale in December. Chef Executive Officer
 Carlos Ghosn  has said he aims to have capacity to build 500,000
electric cars a year by 2012. The Leaf will sell for $32,780 in
the U.S. and 3.76 million yen in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
