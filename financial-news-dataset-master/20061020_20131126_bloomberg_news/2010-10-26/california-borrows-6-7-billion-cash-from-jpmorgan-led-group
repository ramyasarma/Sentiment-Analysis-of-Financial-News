California borrowed $6.7 billion
from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and five other banks to pay delinquent
bills that piled up during the state’s record-length budget
impasse, Treasurer  Bill Lockyer  said.  California, the largest U.S. issuer of municipal debt,
agreed to pay 1.4 percent to the banks, which also include
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for the bridge loan, Lockyer said. He
will repay the debt in about two weeks when he sells an
estimated $10 billion of revenue anticipation notes, a short-
term municipal bond the state offers when cash is low and repays
from later tax collections.  The so-called bridge loan was needed after the most
populous state racked up $8.4 billion of bills that couldn’t be
paid in the 100 days California was without a budget. Governor
 Arnold Schwarzenegger  signed the spending plan Oct. 8 after
lawmakers agreed on steps to eliminate a $19 billion deficit
brought on by the recession.  As part of the plan, lawmakers delayed about $5 billion of
subsidies for schools and colleges until later in the year, to
ease the cash crunch.  The bridge loan is California’s second in as many years.
Lockyer borrowed $1.5 billion in August 2009 from JPMorgan at an
annual interest rate of 3 percent after a similar budget impasse
forced the state to issue IOUs to pay some bills. The loan was
repaid when Lockyer sold $8.8 billion of short-term notes a
month later and used some of the proceeds to repay the debt.  JPMorgan’s $3.125 billion loan was the largest of the
group, followed by Goldman Sachs’s $1.5 billion. Wells Fargo &
Co. lent $1 billion, followed by $500 million from Citigroup
Inc., $325 million from Morgan Stanley and $250 million from the
Golden 1 Credit Union. The loans mature in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
