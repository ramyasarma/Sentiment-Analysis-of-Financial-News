New York City construction spending
is likely to reach bottom in 2010 after three years of declines,
according to a forecast released today.  Building expenditures probably will total $23.7 billion,
down 12 percent from last year and 24 percent from the 2007 peak
of $31.1 billion, the  New York Building Congress  said in its
annual construction outlook.  Spending is likely to reach $25.8 billion in 2011 and $28.6
billion the following year, according to the group. The 2012
projection is “tenuous” because the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, the state agency that runs the New York area’s
subways and commuter trains, has yet to fully fund its capital
commitments for that year, the trade association said.  “All eyes are on the MTA,”  Richard T. Anderson , the group’s
president, said in a statement. “While the MTA’s projected $3.5
billion in 2011 capital spending seems secure, it is uncertain
how much of the $7.6 billion in planned 2012 spending will
actually materialize.”  Construction employment is likely to average 115,000 in
2010, down 12 percent from the 2008 peak of 131,400, according
to the report. The group forecasts jobs will rise to 120,700
next year and 128,300 in 2012. The 2012 projection is dependent
on full funding for the  MTA ’s projects, the association said.  The Building Congress, which represents New York’s
construction industry and unions, urged “a concerted effort” by
government officials and transit advocates to assure the MTA
capital plan is funded. Congestion pricing -- fees on vehicles
entering Manhattan’s densest commercial neighborhoods -- and
tolls on East River bridges may be considered as potential
revenue sources, the group said.  Offices, Sports Venues  Non-residential spending -- including expenditures on
offices, hotels and sports and entertainment venues -- will
total $7.4 billion this year, down from $8.8 billion in 2009,
according to the forecast. It’s likely to rise to $8.7 billion
next year, then decline to $7.7 billion in 2012.  The rebuilding of the World Trade Center probably will
account for about $2 billion a year of construction spending, or
about one-fourth of all non-residential spending citywide
through 2012, the Building Congress said.  The recession’s aftermath “continues to take its toll on
contractors and skilled workers,”  Dominick Servedio , chairman of
the New York Building Foundation, said in the statement. “While
demand remains weak overall, we are fortunate that a few major
projects, including the World Trade Center, Atlantic Yards and
Madison Square Garden, will continue to generate construction
activity during the forecast period.”  Slump Continues  The slump in residential building is likely to continue,
according to the report. Spending on such projects probably will
total $1.6 billion this year, down from $2.5 billion in 2009.
From 2006 to 2008, when plentiful credit helped fuel a boom,
residential construction outlays averaged $6.2 billion annually.  Homebuilding expenditures probably will rise to $1.9
billion next year and $2.2 billion in 2012, the Building
Congress said. The group forecasts that the city will add 6,500
residential units next year, up from this year’s 6,000, and
7,000 in 2012. The city averaged 32,000 new units annually from
2005 to 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
