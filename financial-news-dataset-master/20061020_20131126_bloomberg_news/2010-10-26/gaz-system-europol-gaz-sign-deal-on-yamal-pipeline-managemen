Poland’s pipeline operator Gaz-
System SA said it signed a deal to take over the management of
the Yamal natural gas pipeline from EuRoPol Gaz SA, a joint
venture of OAO Gazprom of Russia and Poland’s Polskie Gornictwo
Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA.  The deal, initialed on Oct. 18, will pave the way for the
Polish energy regulator to officially name Gaz-System as the
operator of the Yamal pipeline on the territory of Poland, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
