Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
AB’s Xperia captured 21 percent of Japan’s smartphone market in
the six months ended September, cutting the share of  Apple
Inc. ’s iPhone,  MM Research Institute Ltd.  said.  Devices running on Apple’s software accounted for 60
percent of all smartphone shipments in the nation during the
period, down from 61 percent a year earlier, Tadayuki Shinozaki,
an analyst at the Tokyo-based research, said by telephone today.
Xperia, which runs  Google Inc. ’s Android software, went on sale
in Japan on April 1.  Sharp Corp. , which introduced its first Android model in
June, had 6.3 percent of the shipments, the researcher said in a
report today.  Toshiba Corp.  and handsets made by Taiwan’s HTC
Corp., which run on Android and Microsoft Corp.’s Windows
software, had the same share of 4.5 percent, it said.  Softbank Corp. , Japan’s third-largest mobile-phone operator,
is the exclusive provider of the iPhone in Japan. Xperia
operates only on the network of  NTT DoCoMo Inc. , the country’s
largest wireless carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
