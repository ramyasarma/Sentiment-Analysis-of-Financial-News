Northern Trust Corp.  rose the most
in three months in U.S. trading after the U.K.’s Daily Mail
newspaper said HSBC Holdings Plc may make an offer for the
Chicago-based custody bank.  The stock climbed 5.3 percent to $50.57 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the most since July 7. Northern Trust has
declined 3.5 percent this year, while the 15-member Standard and
Poor’s asset management and custody banks  index  is little
changed.  HSBC is considering a $65-a-share bid for Northern Trust to
expand its prime-custody operations, the Mail said in its Market
Report, without saying where it got the information. Paul
Harris, a spokesman for HSBC in London, declined to comment, as
did John O’Connell, a Northern Trust spokesman.  Europe’s largest bank earlier this month abandoned a bid to
buy a $7.3 billion stake in South Africa’s Nedbank Group Ltd.
Lenders are under pressure to hold more capital than the minimum
international regulators agreed in Basel last month.  Northern Trust last week posted a 17 percent decrease in
third-quarter earnings as low interest rates squeezed lending
and money-market revenue. Custody banks keep records, track
performance and lend securities to institutional investors such
as pension plans and hedge funds. Northern Trust also manages
mutual funds and institutional accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
