Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle, the world’s biggest export harbor for the power-
station fuel, increased 3 percent last week while the queue of
vessels waiting to load shortened.  The volume of the commodity exported in the week ended 7
a.m. local time yesterday climbed to 2.45 million metric tons
from 2.38 million in the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp.
said on its website today.  Rio Tinto Group,  Xstrata Plc  and BHP Billiton Ltd. are
among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor, which
has three export terminals. Nine vessels were outside the port,
down from 12 a week earlier, while the waiting period averaged
14.25 days, compared with 13.92, the report said.  Power-station coal prices at Newcastle, an Asian benchmark,
gained 2.2 percent, according to the  globalCOAL  NEWC Index

22, from $96.91 in the previous period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
