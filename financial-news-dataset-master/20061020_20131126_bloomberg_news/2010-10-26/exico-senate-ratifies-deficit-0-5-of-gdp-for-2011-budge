Mexico’s upper house of congress
passed the income portion of the 2011 budget, approving a wider
deficit and higher oil price than President  Felipe Calderon 
originally proposed.  Senators ratified the 2011 income law, approved by the
lower house on Oct. 20, with a deficit equal to 0.5 percent of
gross domestic product and an estimated oil price of $65.40 per
barrel. Calderon on Sept. 8 proposed a deficit of 0.3 percent
and estimated oil would sell for $63 per barrel on average next
year.  Upper house lawmakers also ratified a tax increase on
cigarettes and set a 25 percent tax on energy drinks such as
those sold by Red Bull GmbH.  Mexico’s 2010 budget calls for a deficit of 0.7 percent of
GDP. That compares with a 9.1 percent deficit in the U.S.
through the first half of this year and a 3.4 percent deficit in
Brazil through August.  The lower house must agree on the spending portion of the
2011 budget proposal by Nov. 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
