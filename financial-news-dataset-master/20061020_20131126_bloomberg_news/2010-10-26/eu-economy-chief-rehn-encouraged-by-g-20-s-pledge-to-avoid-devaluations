Group of 20 commitments to avoid
competitive currency devaluations are encouraging, European
Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn said.  “The problems caused by imbalances were clearly

to refraining from competitive devaluation of currencies,” Rehn
said at the Lisbon Council think tank in Brussels today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
