Anglo American Plc  and  Xstrata Plc’s 
Collahuasi unit may seek to extend wage talks with workers to
avert a strike at the world’s fourth-largest copper mine.  Collahuasi’s management aims to continue talks into next
month if workers reject a pay deal in an Oct. 27 vote, company
spokeswoman Bernardita Fernandez said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. Under Chilean labor rules, a company can extend
the negotiating period for five days with the consent of workers
before a strike takes place, she said.  “We are open to listening and talking,” Fernandez said.
The five-day extension “represents a possibility to talk.”  Unions called on workers to reject a company offer, setting
the stage for a strike that may drive copper prices higher,
Australian and New Zealand Banking Ltd. analysts led by  Mark Pervan  in Melbourne said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
