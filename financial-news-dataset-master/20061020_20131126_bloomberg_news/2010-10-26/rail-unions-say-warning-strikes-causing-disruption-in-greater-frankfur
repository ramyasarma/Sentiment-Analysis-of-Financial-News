German regional and long-distance
trains were delayed after railway workers temporarily walked off
the job, Deutsche Bahn AG said.  The strikes by 700 workers this morning at railway control
centers and maintenance shops are focused on the states of
Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, the Transnet and GDBA
unions said in a statement today. Delays on long-distance routes
may last until evening,  Deutsche Bahn  said.  The state-owned railway said it’s using hundreds of
additional workers to keep operations running. Customers who
can’t get to their destinations can receive reimbursements for
their tickets without charge, Deutsche Bahn said.  The unions yesterday called on employees to strike today to
put pressure on Deutsche Bahn and a number of private operators
to agree on a uniform wage structure for the industry. Deutsche
Bahn urged the unions to negotiate and call off the strikes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
