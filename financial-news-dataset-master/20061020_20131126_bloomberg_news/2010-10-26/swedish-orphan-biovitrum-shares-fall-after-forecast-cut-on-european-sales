Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB fell the
most in more than a year in Stockholm trading after cutting its
full-year forecast.  Swedish Orphan said sales will increase by 1 percent to 4
percent compared with its earlier forecast of 8 to 10 percent,
because of weaker sales than expected in Europe. Shares in the
Stockholm-based drugmaker fell as much as 8.2 percent, the
steepest decline since July 2009, and were down 1.90 kronor, or
4.6 percent, to 39.50 kronor at 9:14 a.m. local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
