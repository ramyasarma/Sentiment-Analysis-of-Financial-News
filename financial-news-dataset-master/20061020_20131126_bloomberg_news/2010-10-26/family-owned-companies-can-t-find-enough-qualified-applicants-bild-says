A number of Germany’s family owned
companies aren’t currently able to fill vacancies because of a
lack of skilled personnel,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing a study
by DZ Bank AG.  Companies in the electrical and metal industries are most
affected by the scarcity, according to the report, which said 29
percent of companies overall couldn’t fill vacancies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
