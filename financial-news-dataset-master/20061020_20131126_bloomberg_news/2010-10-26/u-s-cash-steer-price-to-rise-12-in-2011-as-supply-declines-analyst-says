Average U.S. cash-steer prices may
climb 12 percent in 2011 as a reduction in supply creates “a
very bullish market for cattle,” said  Altin Kalo , a commodity
analyst at Steiner Consulting Group.  Spot-market live-steer prices will average $1.0683 a pound
next year, up from a projected 95.25 cents in 2010, Kalo said
today in an interview in Chicago.  “We’ve got our slaughter number down about 2.3 percent for
the year for 2011,” Kalo said in a separate telephone
interview. There will be “a bit of a rebound in consumer demand
in the U.S. and expect export market to be firm in 2011,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
