A Swiss  consumer indicator  fell to
the lowest in six months in September, indicating the economic
recovery may stall.  UBS AG ’s  index of consumption , which aims to predict
developments about three months ahead, fell to 1.7 from 1.95 in
August, the Zurich-based bank said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s the lowest since March.  “We expect that consumption will continue to grow robustly
in the coming quarters,” UBS said in the statement. “Low
interest rates and an improvement in the labor market, as well
as the ongoing strong increase in the permanent resident
population, should continue to support private consumption.”  Swiss consumers are stepping up spending after an export-
led recovery prompted companies to boost hiring and output.
 Unemployment  dropped to 3.7 percent in September, the lowest in
more than a year. Still, the Swiss central bank on Sept. 16 kept
borrowing costs near zero and forecast a “marked” economic
slowdown in the second half of the year.  The consumer indicator is based on new car sales, retail
sales, overnight hotel stays by Swiss residents within the
country, consumer confidence and credit-card transactions
registered by UBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
