Transportation companies are close
to a level that may help drive more gains for U.S. stocks, said
 Christopher Verrone , at Strategas Research Partners.  The  Dow Jones Transportation Average , which includes
bellwethers FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc., rose to
the highest level since May 3 yesterday and touched its
September 2008 high on an intraday basis. Should the 20-member
gauge of railroads, trucking companies and airlines close above
yesterday’s intraday high of 4,824, it would send a bullish
signal for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , Verrone said.  “Those are economically sensitive groups leading the push
in the markets,” Verrone, lead technical analyst at Strategas,
said in a telephone interview from New York. “It’s a pretty
constructive backdrop. With the transports leading the push
higher, the market’s advance may have the potential to extend
into the first quarter.”  The  S&P 500  has risen as much as 16 percent since reaching
this year’s low in July as companies reported earnings that beat
analyst estimates and the Federal Reserve indicated it will buy
bonds to stimulate the economy.  Of the 13 Dow Transportation companies that reported
results since Oct. 7, 69 percent have  topped  analysts’ per-share
earnings estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 16 percent for the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
