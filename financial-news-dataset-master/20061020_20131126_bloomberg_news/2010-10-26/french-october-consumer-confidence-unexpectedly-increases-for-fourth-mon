French consumer confidence
unexpectedly rose for a fourth month in October to the highest
level since March as employment prospects and corporate earnings
improved.  A gauge of sentiment rose to minus 34 from minus 35 in
September, national statistics office Insee said today in a
statement from Paris. Economists predicted a reading of minus
37, the median of eight forecasts gathered by Bloomberg showed.  Jobless claims slipped to 2.69 million at the end of August
from a five-year high of 2.7 million in May as companies such as
 PSA Peugeot Citroen  and BNP Paribas SA began expanding their
workforces for the first time since the end of France’s worst
recession since World War II. Together with the increase in
wages in the second quarter, that’s helping buoy confidence and
readiness to spend.  “Fewer households are anticipating an increase in
unemployment,” Insee said. People “judge that their financial
situation is improving,” as is their ability to build savings
in coming months, it added.  Expectations that unemployment will worsen fell to 43 in
October from 45 in September. They are down from a peak of 86 in
June 2009 and from 64 at the beginning of the year, Insee
figures show.  The Labor and Finance Ministries report jobless claims for
September later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
