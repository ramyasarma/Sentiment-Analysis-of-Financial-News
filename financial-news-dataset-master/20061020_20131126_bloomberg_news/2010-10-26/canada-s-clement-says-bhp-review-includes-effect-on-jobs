Canadian Industry Minister Tony
Clement reiterated that BHP Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion hostile
takeover offer for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. will be
evaluated on a “net benefits” test.  Clement said the review also evaluates whether the bid will
help innovation, competitiveness and jobs, calling it a “de
facto” national interest test.  Clement said he is feeling no “pressure” and will
consider the points of view of the province and BHP. He spoke to
reporters in Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
