India’s benchmark stock index fell
as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said the global economic
recovery is fragile and expressed concern about inflation.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , the biggest household products
maker, fell the most in almost three months. India must continue
with steps to cool inflation, currently at double the “ideal”
level, Mukherjee said ahead of the central bank monetary policy
meeting next week. Idea Cellular Ltd., the third-largest mobile-
phone company by value, slid the most in two months after profit
fell 18 percent. Its larger peer  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  retreated to
a one-week low.  “Indian investors have not been participating much in the
market,” said  Krishna Sanghavi , head of equities at Kotak
Mahindra Asset Management Co., which manages about $1 billion in
assets. “It’s obviously not a good sign. We’ll have some
disappointments in select stocks and areas like
telecommunications. In telecoms the impact of competition is not
fully reflected in the numbers.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
lost 81.73, or 0.4 percent, to 20,221.39 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai.  Foreign funds became net buyers of Indian stocks for a 38th
trading day, the longest run of inflows since the 40-day period
ended Aug. 9, 2005. Overseas  investment  into Indian stocks
surged 71 percent this year to a record, making the benchmark
index the most expensive in Asia and among the world’s 20
largest markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
dropped 0.4 percent to 6,082. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.4
percent to 2,573.73.  Hindustan Unilever  Hindustan Unilever decreased 2.6 percent to 298.25 rupees,
its steepest drop since July 28.  State Bank of India , the
nation’s largest lender, slid 1.8 percent to 3,180.8 rupees,
reversing three days of gains.  Housing Development Finance
Corp. , the biggest mortgage lender, lost 1.4 percent to 696.35
rupees.  “We shall have to continue to take steps to ensure that
prices are moderated,” Mukherjee said at the Economic Editors’
Conference in New Delhi today. “It will be ideal if we have 4
to 5 percent  inflation , but it may be difficult.” He didn’t
elaborate on the steps required.  The benchmark wholesale-price  inflation rate  climbed to
8.62 percent in September, an increase Mukherjee said was driven
by food prices. Ten-year government bond yields are trading at a
two-year high on speculation central bank Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao may raise interest rates for a sixth time on Nov. 2.  Tata Steel  Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest producer of the alloy, dropped
2.4 percent to 605.65 rupees, its lowest since Sept. 17.
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the largest aluminum producer,
declined 1.6 percent to 217.75 rupees after climbing 4.4 percent
yesterday.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, rose as much as 0.3 percent. A stronger
U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals more expensive in other
currencies and saps demand for commodities as an alternative
investment.  Idea lost 3 percent to 69.45 rupees, the most since Aug.
24.  Reliance Communications Ltd. , the second-largest mobile-
phone operator, fell 2.1 percent to 175.75 rupees, while larger
rival  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  declined 2.5 percent to 328.8 rupees,
its lowest level since Oct. 20.  “Valuations aren’t cheap, investors are being cautious,”
said  Kishor Ostwal , managing director of CNI Research (India)
Ltd., a publicly traded equities research provider in Mumbai.
“At high levels, anything can cause a correction. So, investors
are thinking it’s better to take some money off the table and
book a little profit.”  Titan Industries  Titan Industries Ltd. , the nation’s largest jewelry
retailer, surged 6.1 percent to 3,491.05 rupees, its highest in
at least 19 years, after saying second-quarter profit rose 65
percent from a year earlier.  Foreign funds  bought a net  13.8 billion rupees  ($310.2
million) of Indian equities on Oct. 22, extending this year’s
record inflows to 1.12 trillion rupees, according to data on the
 website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
