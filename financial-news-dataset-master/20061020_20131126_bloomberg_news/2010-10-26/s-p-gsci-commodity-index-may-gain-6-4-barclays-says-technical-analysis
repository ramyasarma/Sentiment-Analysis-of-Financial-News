The S&P GSCI Spot Index of 24
commodities may gain at least 6.4 percent after the measure
climbed above previous resistance levels, according to technical
analysis by Barclays Capital.  The attached chart shows the index has been moving higher
since the beginning of 2009, and previous resistance levels at
about 549 and 554 have now become support areas. The measure may
climb to the 50 percent retracement of the 2008-2009 decline at
about 600, one of the levels singled out in so-called Fibonacci
analysis.  “The past two weeks have seen many commodity markets slip
lower, and while the risk of further downside price action
remains, weakness should be seen as counter-trend and
corrective,” New York-based Barclays analyst  MacNeil Curry  said
in a report yesterday. “As such, we maintain our bullish bias
for a push towards” the 50 percent Fibonacci level and “likely
beyond,” he said.  The index was at 564.1411 at 7:18 a.m. in London and
reached a two-year high of 577.949 on Oct. 14. Assets invested
against the S&P GSCI were estimated at between $75 billion and
$80 billion as of August,  Michael McGlone , senior director of
commodities at S&P indices, said last month.  Raw materials have gained as adverse weather boosted
agricultural commodities and as investors bought metals as an
alternative to a weakening dollar and on speculation the Federal
Reserve will ease policy further to support growth.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
