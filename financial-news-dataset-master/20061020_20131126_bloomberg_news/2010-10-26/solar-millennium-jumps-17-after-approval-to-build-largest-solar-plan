Solar Millennium AG jumped as much
as 17 percent in German trading after its U.S. affiliate won
approval to build the world’s largest power plant using heat
from the sun to generate electricity.  The stock climbed as much as 2.875 euros to 19.675 euros as
of 11:30 a.m. local time.   The $6 billion project proposed for a site in California
was cleared by U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, according to
a statement from the agency yesterday.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
