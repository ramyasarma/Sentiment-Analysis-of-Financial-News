DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. ,
producer of “Shrek Forever After,” said third-quarter profit
doubled on international box-office sales. The shares rose.  Net income increased to $39.8 million, or 47 cents a share,
from $19.6 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, beating the
36-cent average of six analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales gained 39 percent to $188.9 million, the
Glendale, California-based studio said today in a statement.  “Shrek Forever After” contributed $120.4 million of
revenue in the quarter, driven by ticket sales outside the U.S.
International box office for “Shrek,” as well as DVDs and
other revenue from the company’s library, boosted sales above
the $163.3 million average estimate of 14 analysts. Of 18
following the company and tracked by Bloomberg, 7 recommend the
stock, 8 say “hold” and 3 have “sell”  ratings .  Revenue from “Shrek” exceeded Wall Street projections by
about $25 million, according to  Michael Pachter , an analyst with
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. He has a “neutral” rating
on the stock.  The company’s two theatrical releases so far this year have
taken in $1.23 billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to
Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher. “Shrek Forever
After,” released in May, has collected $734 million, while
March’s “How to Train Your Dragon” has taken in $493 million.  The DVD of “How to Train Your Dragon” went on sale on
Oct. 15, too late to affect the quarter’s results. The disc was
the top-selling U.S. home video for the week ended Oct. 16,
according to Rentrak Corp. The company releases the film
“Megamind” in theaters on Nov. 5.  Fourth-quarter sales of the “Dragon” DVD should total
$164 million, the estimate of  Barton Crockett , an analyst at
Lazard Capital Markets, which rates the stock “hold.”  DreamWorks Animation rose $1.89 to $36.25 in extended
trading after the results. The stock gained $1.14 to $34.36 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  and has
declined 14 percent this year.  (DreamWorks Animation began a conference call at 4:30 p.m.
