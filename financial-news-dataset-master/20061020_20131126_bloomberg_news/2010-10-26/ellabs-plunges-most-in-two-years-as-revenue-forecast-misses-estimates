Tellabs Inc. , a telecommunications
equipment maker that sells to  AT&T Inc.  and Verizon Wireless,
fell the most in two years after forecasting revenue for the
fourth quarter that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.  Sales will rise to $410 million to $430 million in the
fourth quarter, the Naperville, Illinois-based company said
today in a statement. That missed the $441.4 million average of
projections compiled by Bloomberg.  The forecast may indicate that Tellabs’ customers are
spending less and the company is relying more on less profitable
businesses, said  Michael Genovese , a New York-based  analyst  for
Soleil Securities Corp. Revenue was $389.3 million in the fourth
quarter a year earlier.  Gross margin, the percentage of revenue left over after the
costs of producing a product, will be 42 to 46 percent in the
fourth quarter, the company said. That’s compared to 45 percent
a year ago. Analysts were predicting 51 percent, Genovese said
in a note.  Shares  fell $1.07, or 13 percent, to $6.99 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading at 9:52 a.m. New York Time after earlier
declining 14 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Oct. 6,
2008. The company had gained 42 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
