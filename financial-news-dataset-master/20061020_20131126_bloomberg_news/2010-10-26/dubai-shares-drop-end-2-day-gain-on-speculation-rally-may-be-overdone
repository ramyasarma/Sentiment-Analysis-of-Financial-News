Dubai shares declined for the first
time this week, led by  Emaar Properties  PJSC and Aramex PJSC, on
investor speculation gains this month may have outpaced
prospects for profit growth.  Emaar, the company with the biggest weighting in the
emirate’s benchmark index, lost 1 percent. Aramex, the Middle
East’s biggest courier company, dropped to the lowest in a
month. The  DFM General Index  slid 0.5 percent to 1,744.63,
trimming the gain for the month to 3.6 percent, at the 2 p.m.
close in the emirate.  “We are seeing profit taking,” said  Kifah Maharmeh ,
general manager at Al Dar Shares & Bonds Brokerage in Abu Dhabi.
“Volumes are low” and investors are “waiting for results.”  Gains of 19 percent in the second half of the year have
left the 32 members of Dubai’s index valued at an average price
to earnings ratio of 14.3. That compares with 12.3 times in Abu
Dhabi and 11.8 times for shares in Qatar’s gauge. About 87
million shares traded in Dubai today compared with a three-month
daily average of 109 million.  Emaar may say tomorrow third-quarter profit rose 6.6
percent to 698 million dirhams ($190 million), according to the
median estimate of four analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The
shares declined to 3.84 dirhams today, paring the gain since
June 30 to 25 percent.  Aramex lost 2.3 percent to 2.12 dirhams, the lowest close
since Sept. 21.  Abu Dhabi’s  measure  slid 0.2 percent and the  Kuwait SE
Price Index  dropped 0.1 percent. Bahrain’s  measure  fell 0.2
percent, while Qatar’s  QE Index  and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  rose 0.4
percent. The Bloomberg  GCC 200 Index  rose 0.2 percent and Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  advanced less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
