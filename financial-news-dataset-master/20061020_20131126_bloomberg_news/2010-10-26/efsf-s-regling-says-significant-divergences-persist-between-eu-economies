The head of the euro-area’s
financial backstop said the worst of the European debt crisis is
over while adding that “significant divergences” persist
between countries in the region.  “Europe has taken decisive action to tackle sovereign-debt
issues in the euro zone,”  Klaus Regling , chief executive
officer of the European Financial Stability Facility, told a
conference today in Brussels. “The worst of the crisis in
Europe is behind us.”  The EFSF would sell bonds backed by 440 billion euros ($614
billion) in national guarantees and use the money it raises to
make loans to euro-area countries in need. The new entity would
sell debt only after an aid request is made by a country.  The EFSF, created for three years, is the main part of a
750 billion-euro aid package that European Union finance
ministers hammered out in May to combat a sovereign debt crisis.
Another 60 billion euros come from the European Commission --
the EU’s executive arm -- and 250 billion euros from the
International Monetary Fund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
