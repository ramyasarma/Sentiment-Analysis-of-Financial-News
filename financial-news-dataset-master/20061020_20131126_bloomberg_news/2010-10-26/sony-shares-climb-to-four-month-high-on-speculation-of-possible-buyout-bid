Sony Corp.  rose to the highest level
in more than two months in Tokyo trading on speculation that the
company may become a buyout target, an analyst said.  The maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation game
consoles rose 0.7 percent to 2,742 yen at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, the highest level since Aug. 2. More than 17.6 million
shares changed hands, more than double the 180-day average of
7.5 million.  “The gain is likely a temporary move based on speculation
of a possible buyout,” said  Yuji Fujimori , a Tokyo-based
analyst at Barclays Capital. There is also speculation about
possible acquisitions in the games and consumer electronics
industry, the analyst said.  Panasonic Corp. , Tokyo-based Sony’s closest domestic rival,
fell 0.4 percent today and Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average declined 0.3 percent.  Sony won’t comment on speculation,  George Boyd , a company
spokesman, said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
