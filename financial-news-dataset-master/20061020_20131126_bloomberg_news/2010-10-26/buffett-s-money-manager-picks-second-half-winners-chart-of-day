Todd Combs ’s latest stock picks as a
hedge-fund manager may help explain why  Warren Buffett  selected
him yesterday to oversee a “significant portion” of Berkshire
Hathaway Inc.’s investments.  Combs’s Castle Point Capital Management LLC added five
financial companies to its stock holdings in the second quarter,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from regulatory filings.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the second-half performance of
the shares through yesterday. Four of the five rose more than a
gauge of financial companies in Standard & Poor’s benchmark U.S.
stock indexes, including the S&P 500.  Leucadia National Corp. , a holding company like Berkshire,
set the pace with a 29 percent advance.  CIT Group Inc.  climbed
20 percent,  Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.  rose 16 percent
and  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  added 11 percent.  Chatham Lodging Trust , a hotel owner that went public in
April, was the only one to fall short of S&P’s  index . The real-
estate investment trust rose 5.9 percent, trailing the industry
gauge by 0.4 percentage point.  Combs’s fund also added warrants on  First Financial Bancorp 
and  PNC Financial Services Group Inc.  and convertible preferred
shares of Wells Fargo & Co. in the second quarter, according to
Bloomberg data. First Financial’s stock gained 12 percent in the
second half through yesterday and PNC’s fell 4.4 percent. Wells
Fargo’s shares added 0.5 percent.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
