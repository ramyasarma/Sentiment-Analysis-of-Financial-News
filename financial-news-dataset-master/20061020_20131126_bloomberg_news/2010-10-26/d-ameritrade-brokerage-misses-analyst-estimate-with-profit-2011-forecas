TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ., the
third-largest U.S. retail brokerage by client assets, reported
fiscal fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst estimates as
equity trading slowed.  Net income fell 27 percent to $114 million, or 20 cents a
share, during the period that ended Sept. 30, compared with
$156.7 million, or 26 cents, a year earlier, the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company said today in a statement. The results
missed the 23-cent  average estimate  of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Earnings and sales  missed estimates as trading slowed the
most since June 2007. Brokerages are contending with the slowest
U.S. stock trading volume in at least two years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. TD Ameritrade hasn’t increased
 earnings  from a year earlier since the third quarter of 2008,
and Chief Executive Officer  Fred Tomczyk  bought options
brokerage Thinkorswim Group Inc. last year to expand beyond
equities.  “The fiscal fourth quarter was a bit of a disappointing
quarter for TD Ameritrade,” Patrick O’Shaughnessy, a Chicago-
based analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc., wrote in a
note. “Commission revenue came in below our already-reduced
estimate.”  Shares Slip  TD Ameritrade  slipped  0.5 percent to $16.67 at 12:43 p.m.
in New York trading after falling as much as 5.1 percent
earlier, the most intraday since Aug. 11. Before today they had
declined 14 percent in 2010. The NYSE Arca Securities
Broker/Dealer Index, which tracks 11 companies including TD
Ameritrade, has fallen 5.5 percent in the same period.  TD Ameritrade, which expects the Federal Reserve to
maintain its benchmark lending rate at near zero next year,
forecast 2011 profit of 90 cents to $1.20 a share, compared with
the average projection of $1.14, according to Bloomberg  data .
The company projected revenue will be a range of $2.4 billion to
$2.9 billion and said it estimates a range of 335,000 to 410,000
average client trades per day. Clients have placed an average of
367,000 daily trades so far in October.  The company will pay a 5-cents-a-share quarterly  dividend ,
according to the statement. It will be payable on Dec. 15 for
shareholders who own stock as of Dec. 1. TD Ameritrade considers
acquisitions first as a way to return capital, followed by share
buybacks, then dividends, Tomczyk said on a conference call
today.  No Acquisitions  “We will continue to look at acquisitions or investments
for growth that provide opportunities to add scale or
capabilities to our business model,” he said on the call. “And
while there are a number of potential opportunities, we have not
yet seen one that makes both strategic and financial sense.”  The company has enough cash to consider further share
buybacks and potential acquisitions, Tomczyk said in a phone
interview. “We haven’t taken anything off the table with
respect to introducing the dividend,” he said.  Stock-trading volume  on U.S. exchanges slowed during the
July-to-September period to a daily average of 7.66 billion
shares. That’s 18 percent less than the same period a year
earlier and the lowest for a quarter in data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to June 2008. Individual investors have
lost faith in equities, removing money from funds focused on
U.S. stocks for 24 straight weeks, according to estimates from
the Washington-based Investment Company Institute.  Sales Miss  Commissions and fees  revenue  fell 31 percent to $250
million in the fourth quarter, according to today’s statement.
Total sales of $608.8 million missed the average analyst
estimate by 1.6 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey. TD
Ameritrade clients placed an average of 317,684 trades per day,
compared with 410,576 a year earlier and 413,461 during the
quarter that ended in June. Net interest revenue rose 15 percent
to $110.9 million.  The shares declined because of “the fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings miss and 2011 guidance that falls short of consensus
expectations, which seem to outweigh the initiation of a
dividend,”  Chris Ross , a New York-based analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd., wrote in a note after the release.  The brokerage had $354.8 billion in client assets as of
Sept. 30, or 17 percent more than a year earlier, according to
the statement.  The company said 2010 operating expenses were $1.6 billion,
and forecast 2011 operating expenses of $1.56 billion to $1.71
billion.  ‘Headwinds’  “I think in the environment we’re in, the headwinds that
you see in the market and level of uncertainty in the economy
and the market, we’re just going to keep our expenses prudently
tight with selective investments,” Tomczyk said in an
interview, citing sales headcount and development in the
company’s technology and marketing programs.  Charles Schwab Corp. , the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, reported third-quarter profit on Oct. 15 that
beat the average analyst estimate as sales from earned interest
and asset-management fees offset a decline in trading revenue.
 E*Trade Financial Corp.  posted quarterly profit on Oct. 20 that
met analyst estimates after setting aside less money for future
loan defaults.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, TD Ameritrade’s largest shareholder,
said Ameritrade’s contribution will add C$33 million to its
wealth management unit in the fiscal fourth quarter. Toronto-
Dominion is Canada’s second-largest bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
