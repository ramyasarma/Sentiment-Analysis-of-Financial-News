The Obama administration is
“monitoring” reports about cuts in exports of rare earths from
China, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said.  President Barack Obama’s National Security Council and the
National Economic Council are keeping watch to see whether China
is slowing down shipments of the minerals, Gibbs said at a
briefing.  “These are important in the production of a whole host of
things and obviously something that NEC and NSC will monitor,”
Gibbs said.  China, the source of more than 90 percent of the world’s
rare earth commodities used to make disk drives, wind turbines,
flat-screen TVs and smart bombs, announced cuts in production in
July and limits on exports as it seeks to control prices of the
commodities.  Germany, Japan and the U.S. have called on China to restore
exports.  Obama likely will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao at
a meeting of the Group of 20 nations next month in Japan.  “If it’s something the security and economic teams think
is
important in terms of where those reports are certainly we
wouldn’t hesitate to bring it up,” Gibbs said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
