South Korea’s won remains
undervalued compared with its level before the global financial
crisis, Asian Development Bank President  Haruhiko Kuroda  said.  Some currencies “including the Korean won, have recently
appreciated quite substantially, but compared with the level
before the crisis, the won is still depreciated,”  Kuroda  said
at a conference in Seoul today.  Emerging Asian economies need to coordinate and cooperate
on currency realignment, and fast-growing emerging nations
should let their currencies appreciate, he also said.  The won has risen 3.3 percent in the past month against the
dollar, the best performer in non-Japan Asia, adding to threats
to South Korea’s exports from slower global growth. Asia’s
fourth-largest economy has joined nations from Brazil to China
and Japan in seeking to limit currency gains this year.  Organizations such as the  Association of Southeast Asian
Nations  or the  Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum can
facilitate currency realignment, Kuroda said.  The won’s strongest level in the past five years was 900.75
against the dollar in October 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It weakened to 1,570.65 in March 2009, and was
trading at 1,117.8 as of 1:38 p.m. in Seoul.  Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 economies vowed to
avoid “competitive devaluation” after meeting in South Korea
last week, as they sought to calm fears of a trade war stemming
from the use of cheaper currencies to promote growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
