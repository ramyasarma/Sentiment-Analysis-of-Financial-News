France will probably sell fewer
bonds than the 186 billion euros worth planned for next year
amid improving government finances as the regional sovereign-
debt crisis eases, the head of the country’s debt agency said.  “It’s very probable that it will be slightly below” 186
billion euros, said  Philippe Mills , chief executive officer of
Agence France Tresor. “We have slightly below funding needs
with the implementation of fiscal consolidation. The commitment
of the French government is very strong.”  France, the second-largest economy in the euro area, will
probably also exceed its target to cut the amount of Treasury
bills outstanding by 15 billion euros this year, Mills said.
“The mainstream scenario is that it will be more than 15
billion euros,” he said in an interview in Brussels today.  France may issue a new 15-year inflation-linked bond
denominated in euros within weeks, depending on demand, he said.  “We are interested in doing this kind of maturity, but
we’re open on the timing,” Mills said. ‘It could be in coming
weeks or early 2011.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
