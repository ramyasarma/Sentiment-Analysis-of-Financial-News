Michael Ignatieff, the leader of
Canada’s opposition Liberal Party, said today Prime Minister
Stephen Harper is “selling out” Canadian interests by not
blocking a BHP Billiton Ltd. $40 billion bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc.  Ignatieff, who was speaking in Parliament, used his first
three opportunities of the daily question period to call on the
government to block the transaction. The Conservative Party
House of Commons leader, John Baird, responded that Canada will
judge the proposed acquisition based on whether it provides
“net benefits” to the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
