The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 4 basis
points to 451.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30 a.m.
in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals a deterioration in
the perception of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1 basis point to 96.75. The cost
of protecting bank bonds from default also increased, with the
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt of 25
banks and insurers up 1 at 121 and the subordinated index 2
higher at 175.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
