Carly Fiorina , the Republican
nominee for U.S. Senate from California, has been hospitalized
for an infection linked to reconstructive surgery after
overcoming breast cancer.  “Carly is upbeat and her doctors expect her to make a
quick and full recovery and be back out on the campaign trail
soon,”  Deborah Bowker , Fiorina’s chief of staff, said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Fiorina, 56, a former  Hewlett-Packard Co.  chief executive
officer, is facing Senator  Barbara Boxer , a Democrat, in one of
the races crucial to determining whether Republicans win
control of the Senate in the Nov. 2 elections. Republicans need
a net gain of 10 seats to achieve a Senate majority.  “We wish Carly Fiorina a speedy recovery and hope she is
able to return to her normal schedule soon,” Boxer’s campaign
manager, Rose Kapolczynski, said in a statement.  An average of opinion polls compiled by the  RealClear
Politics  website gives Boxer a lead of 2.8 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
