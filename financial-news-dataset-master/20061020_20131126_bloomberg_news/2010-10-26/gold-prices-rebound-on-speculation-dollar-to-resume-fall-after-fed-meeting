Gold futures rose on speculation
that the dollar will resume its decline, boosting the appeal of
the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback rose as much as 0.8 percent against a basket
of major currencies. Through yesterday, gold futures gained 5.3
percent since Sept. 14, when the Federal Reserve signaled it may
ease monetary policy further to spur the economy, while the
dollar lost 4.9 percent. The Fed will meet on Nov. 2-3.  “Metals traders believe the dollar is going to continue
downward and they’re positioning for the outcome after the Fed
meeting,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in
Chicago. “The dollar is inherently weak and so far, we’ve had a
very minor corrective bounce. The trend hasn’t changed by any
means.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 70 cents to
$1,339.60 an ounce at 12:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.8 percent. Gold reached
a record $1,388.10 on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
