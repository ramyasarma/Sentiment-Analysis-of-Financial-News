Paul Tudor Jones , founder of $11.5
billion hedge-fund firm Tudor Investment Corp., said a
revaluation of China’s yuan would do more to cut U.S.
unemployment than asset purchases by the Federal Reserve.  A 30 percent revaluation of China’s currency against the
dollar over two years, followed partially by other nations such
as Brazil, Russia and India, would result in a trade-weighted
8.5 percent depreciation of the U.S. currency, Jones said in an
Oct. 21 investor letter. This strategy would create 3 million
jobs in the U.S. and cut the unemployment rate by 1.4 percent by
2014, he said.  A revaluation is “almost six times as powerful in reducing
unemployment as the Fed’s $1+ trillion worth of quantitative
easing,” Jones, 56, said in the letter, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg. “The Fed’s large-scale asset purchases
will have a minimal impact on unemployment that completely fades
to zero by 2015.”  WTO & Rare Earths  China may be vulnerable in seeking to defend its restraints
on the export of rare earths or other commodities because of
conditions it accepted when joining the World Trade Organization
in 2001, a former WTO judge said.  While the trade arbiter’s rules allow nations to tax
exports and safeguard natural resources, China signed pledges
that it would only tax or limit exports from a list of specific
raw materials, said  James Bacchus , a lawyer at  Greenberg Traurig
LLP  in Washington. WTO rules prohibit export quotas, he said.  “What makes China vulnerable is the accession agreement it
signed” to join the WTO, Bacchus, who was chairman of the WTO’s
appellate body, told reporters at a conference on rare earths in
Washington.  Wind-Turbine Tenders  China’s tender for turbine makers to supply 3.5 gigawatts
of wind power projects in Xinjiang and Hebei drew bids that were
significantly lower than previous auctions, according to a
Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst who attended an event to
open the bids.  Chinese wind turbine manufacturers  Sinovel Wind Co. ,
 Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.  and  Dongfang Electric
Corp.  submitted bids for all of the 24 projects, said An Na, the
Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst who attended the ceremony
held by the National Energy Administration in Beijing. A total
of 177 bids were received for all the projects, she said.  China Iran Oil Warning  A reduction in China’s imports of crude oil from Iran may
be a “warning sign” regarding the Middle Eastern country’s
pursuit of nuclear technology, according to consultants
 Petromatrix GmbH .  China cut crude imports from  Iran  in the period from
January to September compared with a year ago even as the
world’s biggest energy consumer shipped in more oil, Petromatrix
said. It decreased supplies from Iran to 415,000 barrels a day,
from 499,000 a day last year, Petromatrix said, citing data from
the Beijing-based Customs General Administration.  Sinovel IPO Delayed  Sinovel Wind Co. , a Chinese wind turbine maker, faces
further investigation by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, which canceled a planned meeting to consider the
company’s IPO.  The watchdog needs to probe “certain matters” at Sinovel
before considering permitting the sale of 105.1 million shares
in an initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange,
the commission said in a statement on its website, without
giving details.  U.S. Copper Pipe Duties  Chinese and Mexican copper pipe will face U.S. dumping
duties after a trade panel concluded that American makers may be
harmed by the low-cost imports of the plumbing and heating pipes.  The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled 5-0 in favor
of a complaint by Memphis, Tennessee-based  Mueller Industries
Inc.  and Cerro Flow Products LLC in St. Louis. It’s the last of
four steps the manufacturers needed to clear to get tariffs
imposed on the pipes.  Obama Watching Rare Earths  The Obama administration is “monitoring” reports about
cuts in exports of rare earths from China, White House press
secretary  Robert Gibbs  said.  President Barack Obama’s National Security Council and the
National Economic Council are keeping watch to see whether China
is slowing down shipments of the minerals, Gibbs said at a
briefing.  MARKETS:  Most U.S. stocks fell, a day after benchmark indexes
