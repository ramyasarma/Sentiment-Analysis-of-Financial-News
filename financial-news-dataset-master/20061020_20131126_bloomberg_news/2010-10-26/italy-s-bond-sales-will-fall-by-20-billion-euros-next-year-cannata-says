Italy will probably reduce its bond
issuance next year by 20 billion euros ($28 billion) as the
nation cuts its deficit, said  Maria Cannata , director general of
public debt at the nation’s finance ministry.  “The consolidation is extremely in line with forecasts,”
Cannata said in an interview in Brussels today.  This year Italy is scheduled to sell between 240 billion
euros and 250 billion euros of bonds, Cannata said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
