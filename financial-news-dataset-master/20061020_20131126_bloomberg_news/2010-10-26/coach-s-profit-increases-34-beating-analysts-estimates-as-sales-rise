Coach Inc. , the largest U.S. maker
of luxury leather handbags, reported a 34 percent increase in
first-quarter profit after luring more shoppers to its stores.
The stock climbed the most in 18 months.  Net income rose to $188.9 million, or 63 cents a  share , the
New York-based company said today. That compared with the 55-
cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales gained 20
percent to $911.7 million, also topping projections.  Chief Executive Officer Lew Frankfort cited “resiliency”
in handbags and accessories in North America for the gains. Some
U.S. consumers are spending more on discretionary goods such as
Coach’s Poppy bags, which typically sell for $200 to $400. The
company also cut average prices to spur spending.  “It’s reflective in part on the success of their overall
pricing strategy that they introduced last summer,” Jennifer
Milan, an analyst with Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in New York,
said in a phone interview. She advises investors to buy Coach
shares.  Coach also boosted  sales  by expanding in Western Europe and
accelerating store openings in China. This year the company also
debuted men’s stand-alone stores and introduced new Charm and
Julia totes.  The stock rose $5.30, or 12 percent, to $49.78 at 4:00 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since
April 2009. The shares have climbed 36 percent this year.  Comparable-store sales climbed 8.5 percent in North America
in the quarter ended Oct. 2. A year earlier, first-quarter
profit amounted to $140.8 million, or 44 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
