Southern Copper Corp. , the largest
producer of copper in Mexico and Peru, will resume shipments of
the metal from its refinery and smelter at the La Caridad
complex in northern Mexico “within days or a couple of weeks
maximum,” said a spokesman for parent Grupo Mexico.  Southern Copper plans to resume output after it reopened
the refinery and smelter that had been shut for almost seven
weeks amid a labor dispute, Grupo Mexico spokesman  Juan Rebolledo , said today in a telephone interview from Mexico City.  Third-quarter earnings will be curbed “insubstantially”
because of the production loss during the closure, Rebolledo
said. A labor accord was reached, he said, without elaborating.  Southern Copper  declared force majeure Sept. 9 at the
refinery after some former workers and rival union members
blocked access the previous week. Force majeure is a legal
clause that allows producers to miss contracted deliveries
because of circumstances beyond their control.  The plant processed about 140,000 metric tons of copper
last year. The La Caridad complex in Sonora, Mexico, is
currently the country’s largest producer of copper.  Rebolledo said Southern Copper sold copper concentrates to
third-party smelters that the refinery couldn’t process because
of the blockade.  Copper futures for December delivery gained 1.35 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $3.8700 a pound at 12:54 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. Earlier, the metal fell as much as 0.6 percent. The
price touched $3.893 today, the highest since July 7, 2008.  Southern Copper rose 1.2 percent to $42.97 at 1:14 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has climbed
24 percent  in the past year .  To contact the reporter on this story:
