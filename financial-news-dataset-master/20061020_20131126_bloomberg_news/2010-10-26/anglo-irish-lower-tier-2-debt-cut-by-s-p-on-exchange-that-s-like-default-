Anglo Irish Bank Corp. ’s lower Tier
2 subordinated bonds were cut to D for default by Standard &
Poor’s after the nationalized lender announced a debt exchange
offer.  S&P lowered the rating on some of Anglo Irish’s riskiest
securities by four levels from CCC because the tender offer is
“a distressed exchange and tantamount to default,” the New
York-based firm said in a statement today.  DBRS, a rival rating company based in Toronto, said
yesterday it would cut Anglo Irish’s subordinated debt by one
step to default after it completed the bond exchange, announced
on Oct. 21. The lender is offering investors 20 cents on the
euro in new bonds to those tendering junior debt, and 1 cent per
1,000-euro ($1,390) face amount for those declining to take
part, after the Irish government said bondholders should be
forced to share the burden of bank bailouts.  If Anglo Irish investors fully accept the tender offer, the
bank “will reportedly create additional core Tier 1 capital of
about 1.5 billion euros,” S&P said.  S&P kept Anglo Irish’s BBB senior credit rating on
CreditWatch negative, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
