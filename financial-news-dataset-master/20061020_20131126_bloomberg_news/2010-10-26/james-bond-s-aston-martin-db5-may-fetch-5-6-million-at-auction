A gadget-packed 1964 Aston Martin
DB5 driven by  Sean Connery  in two James Bond movies may fetch
more than 3.5 million pounds ($5.6 million) in an  auction today ,
according to RM Auctions.  “That’ll be a record price certainly for any movie car,”
Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions, said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday. “Everyone all
over the world is going to be watching this auction because of
the Bond Car.”  The silver car -- which comes with props such as a bullet-
proof shield, revolving number plates, an oil slick sprayer and
machine guns -- is among more than 100 vehicles under offer at
the annual ‘Automobiles of London’ event at Battersea Evolution
in London, the auction house said in an e-mailed statement.  The  DB5  featured in ‘Goldfinger’ in 1964 and ‘Thunderball’
a year later. A second DB5, which also appeared on screen, was
stolen from an airplane hangar in Boca Raton, Florida, in 1997.
Its whereabouts is unknown, according to RM’s website.  The car has one ex-factory owner, Jerry Lee, an American
broadcaster who brought it for $12,000 in 1969. He is selling
the Aston Martin to fund his charitable organization, The Jerry
Lee Foundation.  Joining the DB5 in the auction are 18 Aston Martins, 12
Rolls-Royce cars, 9  Ferraris  and 8 Bentleys. In May 2009, RM
Auctions sold its most expensive car -- a 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa
Rossa for $12.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
