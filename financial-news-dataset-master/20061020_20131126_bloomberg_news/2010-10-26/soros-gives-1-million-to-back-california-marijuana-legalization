Billionaire investor  George Soros 
gave $1 million to support passage of marijuana legalization in
California a week before the election, after polls showed the
proposal losing steam with likely voters.  “Regulating and taxing marijuana would simultaneously save
taxpayers billions of dollars in enforcement and incarceration
costs, while providing many billions of dollars in revenue
annually,” Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management LLC, wrote
in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article today.  Soros donated $1 million to the “Drug Policy Action
Committee to Tax and Regulate Marijuana - Yes on Prop. 19,”
according to a  filing  posted on the California Secretary of
State’s website. Soros’s spokesman,  Michael Vachon , confirmed
the contribution.  Proposition 19, a referendum on the Nov. 2 ballot, would
make it legal for Californians over 21 to possess and grow pot
for personal use. The measure has lost ground, with 51 percent
of likely voters opposed, to 39 percent in support, according to
a University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll Oct.
22. A May survey showed backers leading, 49 percent to 41
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
