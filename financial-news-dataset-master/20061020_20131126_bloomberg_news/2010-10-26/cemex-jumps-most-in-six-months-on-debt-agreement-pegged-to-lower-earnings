Cemex SAB , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, jumped the most since April after amending a
financial agreement with banks to take into account lower-than-
expected earnings.  Cemex gained 5.7 percent to 10.71 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 12:43 p.m. New York time. Earlier, the shares gained
as much as 9.1 percent, the biggest jump since April 23.  The company will pay a fee of 25 basis points and agreed to
sell equity or equity-linked securities of $1 billion next year
as part of the amendments, according to a statement. Cemex last
year reached a financial agreement with banks to refinance $15
billion of debt to avoid default. The amendments come as the
company posted its fourth-straight net loss.  “It takes away a significant pressure, or a significant
risk, with regards to the debt review,” said  Carlos Hermosillo ,
an analyst with Grupo Financiero Banorte in Mexico City.  Cemex posted a net loss of $89.3 million in the third
quarter, compared with net income of $121 million, or 14 cents,
a year earlier, the Monterrey, Mexico-based company said today.
Profit has been hurt by a slower than expected recovery in the
global construction industry.  Mexico’s benchmark IPC  index  was little changed at
35,269.74.  To contact the reporter on this story:
