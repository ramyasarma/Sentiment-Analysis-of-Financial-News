Canadian stocks  fell the most in two
months as metal and crude oil prices dropped on a stronger U.S.
dollar and  Canadian National Railway Co . failed to boost its
profit forecast.  CN, the country’s biggest railroad, lost 3.4 percent after
at least three analysts reduced their rating on the stock.
 Barrick Gold Corp ., the world’s largest gold producer, decreased
1.8 percent as the U.S. dollar rose against all other major
currencies.  Suncor Energy Inc ., Canada’s biggest oil and gas
producer, declined 2.4 percent after the U.S. reported an
increase in crude supplies.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 117.43
points, or 0.9 percent, from a two-year high to 12,567.25.  “The real key today focuses around the U.S. dollar,” said
 Robert McWhirter , who oversees C$140 million ($136 million) as a
money manager at Selective Asset Management Inc. in Toronto.
“We continue to get a large number of comments from a large
number of technicians that say the U.S. dollar has been
oversold. Gold, copper and oil are going to pull back as a
result.”  The S&P/TSX has slipped 0.8 percent since Oct. 13 after
surging 9.9 percent in the prior two months. The  U.S. dollar  has
rebounded 1.3 percent against a basket of world currencies over
the last two weeks as concerns over potential U.S. Federal
Reserve stimulus measures became factored into exchange rates.  Slow Start  The U.S. dollar advanced to a one-week high today after the
Wall Street Journal said Fed asset purchases are likely to total
“a few hundred billion dollars over several months.” The
newspaper did not say where it obtained the information.  Economists at Bank of America Corp. and  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc . had forecast the central bank will announce $500 billion in
securities purchases next week and eventually buy at least $1
trillion.  “People were expecting more of a shock-and-awe kind of
thing -- $500 billion right out of the gate,” McWhirter said.  Gold stocks  declined as the metal lost 1.2 percent in New
York. Barrick decreased 1.8 percent to C$46.94.  Kinross Gold
Corp ., Canada’s third-largest gold producer, decreased 2.6
percent to C$17.61.  Eldorado Gold Corp ., Canada’s fifth-biggest
producer by market value, retreated 3.1 percent to C$17.07.  Oil Inventories  Crude oil fell 0.7 percent to $81.94 a barrel. U.S.
 inventories  climbed by 5 million barrels last week, the U.S.
Energy Department said today. The figure is five times the
median estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Suncor dropped for a 10th day, its longest streak of
declines ever, slumping 2.4 percent to C$32.55. Cenovus Energy
Inc., Canada’s fifth-biggest energy company by market value,
slipped 1.2 percent to C$29.09.  Canadian Oil Sands Trust , the
largest owner of the Syncrude project, declined 1.7 percent to
C$26.48.  An  index  of base-metals and coal producers retreated 1.9
percent as copper fell from a 27-month high and  Teck Resources
Ltd . and  Lundin Mining Corp . missed analysts’ earnings
estimates.  Teck, Canada’s largest company in the industry, dropped 1.4
percent to C$45.31 after reporting profit of 79 cents a share,
excluding certain items, missing the average analyst estimate of
89 cents a share. Lundin Mining, which produces base metals in
Europe, sank 6.8 percent to C$6.31 after falling short of the
average third-quarter analyst profit forecast by 36 percent,
excluding certain items.  Missed Estimate  Canadian National lost 3.4 percent, the most in 14 months,
to C$66.13 after announcing third-quarter earnings that beat the
average analyst estimate by 4.7 percent, excluding certain
items. The railroad didn’t increase its 2010  profit forecast ,
leaving it short of the average analyst prediction.  In a note to clients,  John R. Mims , an analyst at BB&T
Corp., called CN’s forecast “disappointing” and cut his rating
on the stock to “hold” from “buy.”  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  fell as investors speculated
the Fed will try to spur the U.S. economy gradually.  Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest lender by
assets, dropped 1.3 percent to C$54.92.  Toronto-Dominion Bank ,
its largest domestic rival, declined for a fifth day, retreating
0.9 percent to C$73.55.  Manulife Financial Corp ., North
America’s third-biggest insurer, lost 1.5 percent to C$12.88.  Reinsurance Sale  Sun Life Financial Inc . advanced for a  ninth day , the
longest streak in six years, increasing 2 percent to C$28.58.
Canada’s third-largest insurance company agreed to sell a
business backstopping life insurance policies to  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc .  TMX Group Inc., which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange,
rallied 1.9 percent to a one-year high of C$34.18 after raising
its quarterly  dividend  5.3 percent to 40 cents a share as of the
dividend payable Nov. 26.  IESI-BFC Ltd ., Canada’s largest publicly traded waste-
management company, decreased 5.2 percent to C$23.39 after
reiterating its 2010 sales forecast of $1.395 billion to $1.415
billion. Analysts had forecast revenue of $1.419 billion,
according to the average of 14  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
