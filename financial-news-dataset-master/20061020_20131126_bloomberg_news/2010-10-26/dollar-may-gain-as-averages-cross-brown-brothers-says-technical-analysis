The dollar may advance against the
euro should the 5- and 20-day moving averages intersect,
according to Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.  The currency pair reversed direction four times as the
technical indicators crossed during the past six months, said
 Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York.  “The euro bulls are at the end of their punch,” Chandler
said. “We’ve got to get past next week’s events: the elections
and the Federal Reserve meeting. After the election, the dollar
will find better traction.”  The 16-nation currency has appreciated 4.5 percent versus
the dollar since Sept. 21, when the Fed said after its policy
meeting that it may boost asset purchases, a measure that may
debase the dollar. The Fed will meet again Nov. 2-3, and U.S.
elections will be Nov. 2.  The euro decreased 0.8 percent to $1.3857 at 3:24 p.m. in
New York, from $1.3965 yesterday. It touched $1.4159 on Oct. 15,
the highest level since Jan. 26.  Figures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on Oct. 22 that bets the  euro  will gain versus the dollar
were at almost the highest level since October 2009, indicating
the common currency’s rally may be poised for a reversal.  Since mid-April, the 5- and 20-day moving averages have
crossed four times: April 21, June 16, Aug. 12 and Sept. 14.
Each time, the euro-dollar changed direction.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
