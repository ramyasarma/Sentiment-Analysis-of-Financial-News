German consumer confidence will
remain at the highest level in two and a half years in November
after the economic outlook improved and unemployment declined,
according to GfK AG.  The Nuremberg-based market research company said today that
its  consumer sentiment index , based on a survey of about 2,000
people, will remain at 4.9, the highest since May 2008.
Economists forecast a gain to 5.1 in November, the median of 26
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey  shows.  German  unemployment  declined for a 15th month in October
after surging exports and investment fueled record economic
expansion in the second quarter. The country’s HDE retail
association last month raised this year’s sales growth forecast
to 1.5 percent from zero.  “Positive consumer sentiment in conjunction with the
significant relaxation on the labor market will ensure a further
stabilization of domestic demand,” GfK said in a statement.
“Consumers still expect the German economy to continue to
recover.”  GfK’s measure of households’ economic expectations rose to
56 in October from 53.5 in September. A gauge of income
expectations decreased to 36 from 45.2, while an index of
consumers’ willingness to spend fell to 22.5 from 30.7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
