China may increase coal imports as
cold weather moves across the country, Deutsche Bank AG said.  Imports rose 15.6 percent in September from the previous
month, analyst Adam Sieminski wrote in a report dated today.
China’s refined copper imports, down 9.5 percent over the same
period, probably remained weak this month because of national
holidays, he wrote. October copper imports have been low for the
past six years, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
