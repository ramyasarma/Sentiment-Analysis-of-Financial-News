Canada’s two-year, C$47 billion ($46
billon) economic stimulus plan was “well managed,” a federal
auditor said, as proper spending oversight was kept in place
while departments sped up approvals to ease a recession.  “I give the government high marks for that initial
phase,” Auditor General  Sheila Fraser  said today in Ottawa. All
projects her office checked met the eligibility requirements,
she said, adding another review on how well the approved
projects were delivered is due next year. She was unable to
verify how many jobs the stimulus created or saved.  Conservative Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  has said
measures such as construction projects and enhanced jobless
benefits helped pull Canada out of the recession faster than
other Group of Seven countries, while opposition leader  Michael Ignatieff  of the Liberal Party has said some of the money has
been wasted and other measures should be extended past a March
deadline.  Today’s report also found “troubling” lapses in the C$11
billion purchases of two types of military helicopters.
Officials failed to account for the complexity of the projects
that led to delays and cost over-runs, Fraser said.  “They were presented as off-the-shelf,” she said at a
press conference. “They were helicopters that had never flown
before.”  There was also “sound regulation and supervision” of
financial institutions during the global credit squeeze, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
