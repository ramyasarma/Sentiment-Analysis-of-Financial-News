RBC Capital Markets, the investment
banking unit of  Royal Bank of Canada , said it’s been designated
a primary dealer in Germany.  The announcement follows yesterday’s appointment of the
Toronto-based firm as a primary dealer for France. RBC Capital
Markets has been a market maker in the U.K. for more than a
decade and in the U.S. was designated a primary dealer to the
Federal Reserve of New York in July 2009, the bank said.  “We are now looking to build on our success in these
markets and are focused on establishing a trade capability
across multiple jurisdictions in Europe,”  Harry Samuel , RBC’s
global co-head of fixed income currencies, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Primary dealers participate in auctions of government debt,
place treasury securities and liquidity in the secondary market
and report on market developments and transaction volumes, the
bank said. RBC also acts as the equivalent of a primary dealer
in Canada and Australia. Royal Bank of Canada is the country’s
biggest bank by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
