U.K. stocks dropped, sending the
FTSE 100 Index lower for a second day, as a fall in raw-material
prices weakened mining shares.  Rio Tinto led commodity stocks lower.  CSR Plc  slumped 10
percent as the maker of chips used in Nokia Oyj mobile phones
forecast profit for the fourth quarter that missed estimates.
Soco International Plc plunged 11 percent after saying it will
plug and abandon a well in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  fell 61.28, or 1.1 percent, to
5,646.02 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has still
climbed 17 percent since July 1 as investors speculated that the
Federal Reserve will announce additional measures to spur the
economy at its November meeting, while companies from Nokia to
Fiat SpA reported results that beat analysts’ estimates. The
FTSE All-Share Index declined 1.1 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index fell 0.3 percent.  “Traders seem wary ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next
meeting on Nov. 3,” said  Manoj Ladwa , a senior trader at ETX
Capital in London. “Given the recent gains and the difficulty
the market had pushing through the 5,800 level, a pullback to
around 5,400 looks increasingly likely in coming days.”  Copper Drops  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company, slid
2.6 percent to 4,052.5 pence. BHP Billiton Ltd. declined 1.5
percent to 2,163.5 pence and Xstrata Plc lost 3.8 percent to
1,264 pence. Copper dropped for a second day as the dollar
strengthened and on speculation that users in China deem the
recent rally as excessive given ample domestic supplies.  CSR lost 10 percent to 309.6 pence, the biggest drop since
July. Fourth-quarter revenue will probably fall to between $170
million and $185 million, the company said.  Soco International lost 11 percent to 292 pence after the
U.K. energy explorer in Africa and Southeast Asia said a second
well in the Democratic Republic of Congo failed to find
recoverable oil and gas in the main target area.   Carpetright
Plc , the U.K.’s biggest carpet retailer, slumped 7.3 percent to
677 pence. The company said revenue fell as it shut stores and
fewer customers bought carpets and floor coverings.  Talvivaara Mining Co. Plc gained 2.5 percent to 546 pence.
The company said its third-quarter financial result will be
“substantially” better than in previous quarters as nickel
prices rose more than it had expected.  Banks gained after Deutsche Bank AG posted results that
topped analysts’ projections. Barclays Plc gained 1.8 percent to
282.3 pence and Lloyds Banking Group Plc climbed 1.7 percent to
69.12 pence.  Halfords Group Plc rallied 4 percent to 425.8 pence after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley upgraded the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
