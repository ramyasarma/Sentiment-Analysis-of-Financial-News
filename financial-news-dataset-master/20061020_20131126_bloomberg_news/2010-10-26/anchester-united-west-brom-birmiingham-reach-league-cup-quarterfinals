Defending champion Manchester United
beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-2 to advance to the quarterfinals
of English soccer’s League Cup.  Premier League clubs Birmingham, West Bromwich Albion and
Wigan also moved into the final eight by beating lower-division
teams, as did Ipswich of the second-tier Championship.  Javier Hernandez came off the bench to score in the 90th
minute to give Manchester United the fourth-round victory at Old
Trafford. Bebe and  Ji-Sung Park  also scored for United, while
George Elokobi and Kevin Foley had the goals for Wolves.  Birmingham beat Brentford of League One in a penalty
shootout 4-3 after the game finished 1-1 following extra time.
Birmingham’s  Kevin Phillips  scored in second-half stoppage time
to cancel out a 68th-minute goal from Sam Wood.  West Brom and Wigan beat teams from the Championship. Simon
Cox scored twice to lead West Brom over Leicester 4-1, while
goals from Mauro Boselli and  Ben Watson  gave Wigan a 2-0 win
against Swansea. Ipswich came from behind to beat Northampton,
which is next-to-last in League Two, 3-1.  The remaining three quarterfinal spots will be filled
tomorrow, when Aston Villa hosts Burnley, Arsenal visits
Newcastle and Stoke travels to West Ham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
