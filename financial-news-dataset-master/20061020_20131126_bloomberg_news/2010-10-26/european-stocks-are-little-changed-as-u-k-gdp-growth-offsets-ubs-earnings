European stocks were little changed,
paring their losses, as the U.K. economy grew in the third
quarter by twice as much as forecast, offsetting a surprise
investment-banking loss at UBS AG.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed, slipping 0.1
percent to 267.09 at 11:19 a.m. in London after earlier dropping
as much as 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
