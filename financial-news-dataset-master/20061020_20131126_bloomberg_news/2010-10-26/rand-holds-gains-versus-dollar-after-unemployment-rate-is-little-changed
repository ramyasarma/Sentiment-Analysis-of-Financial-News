South Africa’s rand held gains
versus the dollar after a government report showed the nation’s
unemployment rate was little changed in the third quarter.  The currency traded 0.1 percent stronger at 6.9119 per
dollar by 11:32 a.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of
6.9218.  South Africa’s unemployment rate was 25.3 percent in the
third quarter, up from a revised 25.2 percent in the three-
months through June, the Pretoria-based statistics office said
in a report today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
