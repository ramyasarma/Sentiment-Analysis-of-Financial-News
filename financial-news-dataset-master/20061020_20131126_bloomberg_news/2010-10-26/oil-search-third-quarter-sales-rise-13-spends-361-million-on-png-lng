Oil Search Ltd. , Papua New Guinea’s
largest oil and gas producer, said third-quarter revenue
increased 13 percent as prices climbed.  Revenue rose to $142.2 million in the three months ended
Sept. 30 from $125.5 million a year earlier, the Port Moresby-
based producer said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange today. Output fell about 12 percent to 1.85 million
barrels of oil equivalent, partly because of aging fields, the
company said.  Oil Search, a partner in a $15 billion liquefied natural
gas project led by  Exxon Mobil Corp.  in Papua New Guinea, said
it spent $361 million on the development during the quarter. The
venture, among more than a dozen in Australia and Papua New
Guinea targeting Asian demand for the cleaner-burning fuel,
employed 3,000 people at the end of September, it said.  The partners continue to discuss plans to expand the
project and may accelerate drilling at the Hides gas field, Oil
Search said.  The company’s  shares  dropped 0.5 percent to A$6.49 in
Sydney, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.5 percent.
Oil Search has gained 5.9 percent this year, compared with the
benchmark’s 3.8 percent decline.  Oil Search received an average price of $79.06 a barrel for
its oil in the quarter, compared with $72.44 a year earlier.  A
company-wide review of strategy is at an “advanced stage,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
