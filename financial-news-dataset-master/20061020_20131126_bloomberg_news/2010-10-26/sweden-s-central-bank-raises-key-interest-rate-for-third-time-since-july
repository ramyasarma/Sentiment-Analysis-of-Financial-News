Sweden’s central bank raised the key
interest rate for a third time since July, as it continues to
cool the country’s recovering economy. The Stockholm-based
Riksbank raised the benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage
point to one percent, it said in a statement published today on
its website. The decision was expected by all 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
