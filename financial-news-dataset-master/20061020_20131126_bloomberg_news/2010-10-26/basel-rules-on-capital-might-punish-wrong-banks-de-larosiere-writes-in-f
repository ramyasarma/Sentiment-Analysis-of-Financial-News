The rules on banks’ capital and
liquidity proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
might punish European banks that mostly survived the financial
crisis without state bailouts, said  Jacques de Larosiere , the
co-chairman of the Eurofi Financial Forum.  Writing in the Financial Times, de Larosiere said these
banks, the strong deposit bases of which gave the system
stability, might, under the Basel proposals, reduce activities
with modest margins, such as lending to small and medium-sized
businesses, and operate in a more profitable but riskier way.  Thus, the banking model most conducive to financial
stability and economic growth might be the main casualty of the
new arrangements, and the Anglo-Saxon model that developed
trading activities and unsupervised off-balance sheet vehicles
with risky and opaque products would be left in place, de
Larosiere argued.  To contact the reporter on this story:
