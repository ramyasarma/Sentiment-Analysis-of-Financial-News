Agco Corp. , the second-biggest U.S.
maker of farm equipment, sees orders from livestock and dairy
farmers “improving slightly,” Chief Financial Officer  Andy Beck  said.  “We are seeing some improvement,” Beck said in a
telephone interview today. “We are not expecting a big recovery
in our business relating to that sector of the market in the
fourth quarter but we are optimistic that they are starting to
see a little better performance.”  Sales to livestock and dairy farmers comprise as much as a
quarter of Agco’s revenues in the U.S. and a third in Europe,
said Greg Peterson, Agco’s director of investor relations. North
American retail sales of mid-range tractors and hay equipment
declined in the first nine months of 2010 from a year earlier,
the Duluth, Georgia-based company said in a statement today.  “It’s going to take those farmers a period of time to
recover,” Beck said. “They’ve had a fairly extended period of
weakness.”  Agco today raised its full-year earnings forecast to $2.10
to $2.20 share from $1.85 to $2 given previously.  Third-quarter net income climbed more than fivefold to
$62.3 million, or 65 cents a share, from $11.1 million, or 12
cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding restructuring and
severance costs was 66 cents a share, beating the 49-cent
average of 14 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
increased 19 percent to $1.66 billion from $1.39 billion.  Agco  fell $1.02, or 2.3 percent, to $42.81 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 32 percent this year.  Deere & Co., based in Moline, Illinois, is the world’s
largest maker of farm equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
