Macquarie Group Ltd. has cut about
60 jobs in a shakeup of its infrastructure investing unit, the
Financial Times reported.  Macquarie closed its third European infrastructure fund to
new investors after raising 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion),
less than a quarter of its initial target, the FT said.  The company had 590 people in its infrastructure investment
team, the newspaper reported. Paula Hannaford, a Macquarie
spokeswoman in Sydney, didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment on the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
