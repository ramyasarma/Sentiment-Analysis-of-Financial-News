Soybean-meal exports from India,
Asia’s top supplier of the animal feed, may surge 83 percent
this month as farmers boost sales to benefit from prices set for
a fourth straight monthly gain, a processors’ group said.  Sales to Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and China
may total 400,000 metric tons in October, compared with 218,247
tons a year earlier,  Rajesh Agrawal , a coordinator for the
Soybean Processors Association of India, said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Soybean-meal futures in Chicago are poised for a fourth
straight monthly advance after the oilseeds surged on increased
import demand from China and on concerns that soybean planting
may be curbed in Brazil, the world’s second-biggest producer
after the U.S. India’s soybean-meal exports may jump to 3.5
million tons in the year that began Oct. 1, from 2.35 million
tons last year, Agrawal said.  “There’s a fair amount of demand for Indian meal from our
traditional buyers,” Agrawal said. “Rising prices haven’t
deterred them as Indian meals have inherent advantages.”  India exports the majority of its soybean meal, mixed with
poultry feed as a form of protein to aid the growth of birds and
cattle. Meal from the South Asian country is preferred by buyers
in Southeast Asia because it’s made from non-genetically
modified seeds and has short delivery times, Agrawal said.  ‘Alarming Rate’  The feed was being offered at about $420 a ton on a free-
on-board basis at ports in western India, Agrawal said. Soybean-
meal for December delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent to
$331.60 a ton on the Chicago Board of Trade and traded at
$332.80 a ton at 2:38 p.m. Mumbai time. The contract climbed as
high as $340.20 on Oct. 21, the highest price since June 15,
2009.  “Since climatic conditions in Brazil and Argentina are
still a concern, China’s demand for U.S. meal is growing at an
alarming rate, supporting meal prices,” AnandRathi Commodities
Ltd. said in a report today. “Besides, meal demand from India
is also strong, supporting the rally in meal prices on the CBOT
as well as on the spot front in domestic markets,” it said.  Soybeans have jumped 10 percent this month on the National
Commodity & Derivatives Exchange in Mumbai as an extended
monsoon season delayed harvests in Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra, the biggest producers. November-delivery futures
fell as much as 0.6 percent to 2,233 rupees ($50.23) per 100
kilograms today.  Extended Monsoon  Daily market arrivals of soybeans have risen to about 1
million bags of 50 kilograms each a day, from about 600,000 bags
last week, and may drop during the Diwali holiday on Nov. 5,
Agrawal said.  A yellow mosaic virus attack on plants in some areas in
Madhya Pradesh may damage about 200,000 to 300,000 tons of
oilseeds, according to an initial assessment, he said. A rebound
in output in Maharashtra may make up for the shortfall, he said.  Production may total 10.1 million tons this crop year as
average yield per hectare will increase 8 percent to 1,089
kilograms because of a stronger-than-normal monsoon, the
processors’ group said on Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
