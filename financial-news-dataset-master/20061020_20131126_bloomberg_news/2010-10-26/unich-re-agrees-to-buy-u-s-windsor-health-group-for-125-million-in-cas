Munich Re , the world’s biggest
reinsurer, agreed to buy Windsor Health Group Inc. for $125
million in cash to expand in the U.S. Medicare market.  Munich Re, which is buying Windsor from a group of
investors, will finance the takeover from “existing
resources,” the Munich-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The transaction is scheduled to be completed at
the end of the fourth quarter, the reinsurer said.  Windsor, which is based in Nashville, Tennessee, operates
government-sponsored health plans, providing services to more
than 75,000 members in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South
Carolina and Tennessee, Munich Re said. The health-care company
expects to post earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of $31 million this year and gross written
premium income of $420 million, the German reinsurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
