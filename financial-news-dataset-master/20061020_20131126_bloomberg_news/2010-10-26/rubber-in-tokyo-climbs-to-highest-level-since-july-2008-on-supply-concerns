Rubber futures in Tokyo advanced to
a 27-month high on speculation that China, the world’s largest
buyer, will increase purchases to replenish stockpiles amid
concerns over declining supplies from floods and heavy rains.
Shanghai rubber reached a record.  The April-delivery contract, which was listed today on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, climbed to 343.3 yen per kilogram
($4,252 a metric ton), the highest level since July 14, 2008,
before trading at 339.3 yen at 12:05 p.m. Rubber futures in
Shanghai surged to a record 33,320 yuan ($5,002) a ton before
trading at 33,165 yuan.  “Stockpiles remain at a low level, prompting buyers to
step up purchases,”  Chaiwat Muenmee , analyst at commodity
broker D.S. Futures, said by phone from Bangkok. “Floods in
Thailand and China also raised concerns that production may be
damaged, reducing limited supplies.”  Stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell 0.7 percent to
7,355 tons on Oct. 10, according to data today from the Rubber
Trade Association of Japan.  Natural rubber  inventories  increased by 3,880 tons to
41,681 tons, the highest level in six months, the Shanghai
Futures Exchange said on Oct. 22, based on a survey of 10
warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.
That was 73 percent lower than this year’s high of 151,832 tons
in January.  Torrential rains this month in Hainan after a severe
drought in Yunnan at the beginning of this year, the top two
producing areas in China, will reduce domestic rubber output,
according to Guo Cheng, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co.  Natural rubber imports by China jumped 19 percent from a
month earlier to 190,000 tons in September as the country’s
 passenger-car sales  to dealerships quickened from August on
additional incentives for buyers.  Wholesale deliveries of passenger cars rose 19.3 percent to
1.21 million, accelerating from 18.7 percent in August, the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
