Commerzbank AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Blessing  said more coordination of banking rules
is needed as regulators seek to prevent future financial crises.  New rules by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
move “into the right direction, but we have to be careful the
pendulum doesn’t swing in the wrong direction,” Blessing said
at the Sibos conference in Amsterdam today. “In Europe we need
to move to more European regulation. One of the reasons of the
crisis was regulatory arbitrage.”  The Basel Committee gave regulators the option of
introducing an additional capital buffer to curb the excessive
lending that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. Last month’s Basel III proposals are the strictest
since nations began regulating the global banking system
together in 1974.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chief Executive Officer
 Stephen Hester  also said yesterday that national differences in
regulation should be reduced. ’’If the global differences would
become too big it will be destructive,’’ he said on the
sidelines of the Sibos conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
