Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich emirate
spending billions of dollars to diversify its economy, expects
slower growth and a lower population than previously estimated
by 2030, said a planning official.  There will probably be “more tempered economic growth, but
also lower population growth, because the two are very much
related in the region,” Michael White, a senior planning
manager at the government’s Urban Planning Council, said today
in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Marrakesh. “In
2030 we’ll probably see less than the 3 million.”  The government’s Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 plan
targets 7 percent annual growth through 2015 and 6 percent
thereafter. The emirate won’t reach that this year, Mohamed Omar
Abdulla, undersecretary at the Department of Economic
Development, said on Feb. 2. The emirate forecast its second
annual budget deficit this year.  Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates and
holder of most of its oil resources, in February 2009 injected
16 billion dirhams ($4.4 billion) into its banks after foreign
investors withdrew funds, non-performing loans increased and
global credit markets tightened. Abu Dhabi also lent Dubai $20
billion as it delayed payments on $24.9 billion in debt.  The government is making middle-income housing and
government buildings priorities, White said. It is now a
requirement that “all major developments” include 20 percent
of real-estate units at prices suitable for middle-income
earners.  The  International Monetary Fund  raised its forecast for
economic growth for the United Arab Emirates this year to 2.4
percent from 1.3 percent. In 2011, growth is projected to
accelerate to 3.2 percent, the IMF said in an Oct. 24 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
