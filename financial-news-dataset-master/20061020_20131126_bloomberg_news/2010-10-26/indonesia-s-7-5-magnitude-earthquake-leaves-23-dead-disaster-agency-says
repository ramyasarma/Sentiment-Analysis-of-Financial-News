A magnitude-7.5 earthquake that
caused a small tsunami in Indonesia’s Kepulauan Mentawai region
off western Sumatra yesterday left at least 23 people dead and
167 others missing, the  National Disaster Management Agency  said.  The quake triggered a 3-meter (10-foot) high tsunami that
reached 400 meters inland, Nelis Zuliasri, head of information
at the agency, said today. Eight Australians are among the
missing, she said. They were on a boat in the area where contact
has been lost, she said.  “It’s not clear yet if all of 23 victims were dead because
of the tsunami or hit by ruins,” Zuliasri said by telephone
from Jakarta. The death toll was as of 3:30 p.m. local time
today, the disaster agency said in a statement on its website.  The temblor struck the Kepulauan Mentawai region of
Indonesia, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from Padang, the
provincial capital of West Sumatra, and 640 kilometers from
Singapore at 9:42 p.m. local time yesterday, Priyadi Kardono, a
spokesman at the country’s disaster management agency, said
yesterday. The quake was centered at a depth of 33 kilometers,
according to the USGS.  Ten aftershocks of magnitude 5 to 6.2 were recorded by
Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, the
office said in a statement on its website.  Indonesia, a country of more than 17,000 islands, is prone
to earthquakes as it forms part the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of
volcanoes and fault lines surrounding the Pacific Basin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
