Banco Bonsucesso SA plans to sell as
much as $150 million 10-year bonds to yield 9.5 percent,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The yield is at the high end of a range of 9.25 percent to
9.5 percent given last week to investors. The Sao Paulo-based
bank’s Tier 2 bonds, which can be accounted for as regulatory
capital, may price tomorrow, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms aren’t set.  Banco Santander SA and Banco Espirito Santo SA are managing
the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
