Sugar prices declined the most in
more than a week on speculation that rising output in India, the
world’s second-largest producer, will ease global supply
constraints. Cocoa also retreated.  India’s sugar-cane crop will probably be bigger than
forecast two months ago,  Sergey Gudoshnikov , an economist at the
London-based International Sugar Organization, said today. The
nation may produce 26 million metric tons of the sweetener, up
from an estimate of 25 million tons, he said.  “Sugar coming from India will ease the pressure for now,”
said  Ricardo Scaff , a trader at Rabobank International in New
York.  Raw sugar for March delivery declined 0.54 cent, or 1.9
percent, to settle at 27.96 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest drop since Oct. 15.  The price has still more than doubled after touching a 13-
month low on May 7 as adverse weather threatened production in
Brazil, Russia and China.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery fell
$8.90, or 1.2 percent, to $708.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for December delivery lost $41, or 1.4
percent, to $2,889 a ton in New York.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery dropped 43
pounds, or 2.2 percent, to 1,920 pounds ($3,042) a ton.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery declined 0.1
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.4935 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
