Equity Bank Ltd. , Kenya’s biggest
lender by customers, posted a 52 percent increase in nine-month
profit as loan income surged and said it plans to expand in East
Africa next year. The stock rose for a second day.  Net income climbed to 5.13 billion shillings ($63.6
million) in the period ended Sept. 30, from 3.38 billion
shillings a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer  James Mwangi 
told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital. Net interest
income, the amount banks earn from interest charges on loans,
advanced 52 percent to 12 billion shillings, he said.  Earnings were boosted by “a growing loan book, which has
been buoyed by the increased optimism in the economic outlook,”
Mwangi said.  Banks in Kenya have posted higher earnings as growth in the
region’s biggest economy accelerates and after the central bank
slashed interest rates to a record low to boost credit extension
to businesses and households. Lenders’ assets grew 25 percent to
1.6 trillion shillings in the 12 months through August, as
deposits increased by 22 percent to 1.2 trillion shillings,
Central Bank of Kenya Governor  Njuguna Ndung’u  said last week.  Deposits at Equity grew to 98.8 billion shillings in the
period, from 65.7 billion shilling a year earlier, Mwangi said.
Non-performing loans fell 20 percent to 3.57 billion shillings.  The lender, which already has branches in neighboring
 Uganda  and  Southern Sudan , plans to add units in Rwanda and
Tanzania in the first quarter of next year, Mwangi said.  Equity’s shares gained 25 cents, or 1 percent, to 26.75
shillings at 12:35 p.m. in Nairobi. The stock has surged 86
percent so far this year, outperforming a 44 percent increase in
the benchmark  NSE-20 index  over the same period.  “Equity’s earnings are ahead of the industry in terms of
growth,”  Francis Mwangi , an analyst at Nairobi-based African
Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said in an interview from the
city today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
