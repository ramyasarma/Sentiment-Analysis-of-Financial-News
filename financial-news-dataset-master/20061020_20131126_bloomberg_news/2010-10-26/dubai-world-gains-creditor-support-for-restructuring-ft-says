Dubai World secured full backing for
a $25 billion restructuring after the one creditor that hadn’t
agreed was bought out, the Financial Times reported, citing
unidentified people.  Aurelius Capital Management sold $5 million of Dubai
World’s outstanding liabilities to Deutsche Bank AG, the report
said.  By gaining full creditor support, Dubai World can save the
time and money required to present the plan to a special
tribunal, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
