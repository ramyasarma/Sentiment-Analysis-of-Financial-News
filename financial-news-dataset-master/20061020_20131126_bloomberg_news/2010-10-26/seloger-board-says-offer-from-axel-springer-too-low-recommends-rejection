SeLoger.com’s supervisory board
recommended that investors reject Axel Springer AG’s 34 euros a
share offer, saying it undervalues the company.  An independent expert report valued the company at 37.1
euros to 40 euros a share, the board said in a filing with the
French stock market regulator today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
