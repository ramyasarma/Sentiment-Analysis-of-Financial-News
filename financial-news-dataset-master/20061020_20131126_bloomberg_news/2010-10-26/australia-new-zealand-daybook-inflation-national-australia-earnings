---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: Most U.S. stocks fell as results that disappointed
investors at companies from U.S. Steel Corp. to Kimberly-Clark
Corp. offset higher-than-estimated consumer confidence.
*U.S. Steel tumbled 3.2 percent after a surprise quarterly
loss because of repair costs.
*Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies diapers and Kleenex
tissues, lost 6 percent as profit dropped amid higher costs for
materials.
*The Conference Board’s confidence index increased to 50.2 from
a revised 48.6 in September. The proportion of people who said
jobs were plentiful fell to the lowest level this year.
*The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent to
1,185.16 at 3:10 p.m. in New York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.49 points, or 0.1
percent, to 11,169.54.  London: European stocks retreated after UBS AG, Switzerland’s
biggest bank, reported a surprise investment-banking loss and
ArcelorMittal forecast a decline in earnings, overshadowing
better-than-forecast U.K. economic growth.
*UBS tumbled 5 percent after reporting quarter-on-quarter
drop in revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities.
ArcelorMittal sank 5 percent as it reiterated a “cautious”
outlook for the fourth quarter.
*The Stoxx 600 lost 0.2 percent to 266.92 at the 4:30 p.m. close
in London, as more than two companies fell for every one that
rose.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks fell for a second day, led by exporters
and brokerages, as the yen traded near a 15-year high against
the dollar and as trading volume shrank.  *The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent to 9,377.38
at the 3 p.m. market close.
*The broader Topix index lost 0.4 percent to 817.94.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.5
percent to 4,687.80 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.1 percent to 3,285.44
at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar rose against the euro on speculation an
increase in debt purchases by the Federal Reserve will cause
inflation to accelerate.
*Sterling rallied against all of its major counterparts as a
report showed the U.K.’s economy grew in the third quarter at
double the pace forecast by economists and Standard & Poor’s
raised the nation’s credit outlook.
*The U.S. currency appreciated 0.9 percent to $1.3836 per
euro at 2:16 p.m. in New York.
*The dollar gained 1 percent to 81.62 yen.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries remained lower after the government’s
auction of $35 billion in two-year debt, the second of four note
sales this week totaling $109 billion, drew higher-than-average
demand.
*The securities yielded a record-low 0.40 percent, versus the
average forecast of 0.409 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.
The bid-to-cover ratio was 3.43. The average at the past 10
auctions was 3.2.
*The yield on the current two-year note  increased two basis
points to 0.38 percent at 1:31 p.m. in New York.  COMMODITIES  GOLD  New York: Gold futures rose on speculation that the dollar will
resume its decline, boosting the appeal of the precious metal as
an alternative asset.
*Gold futures  for December delivery rose 70 cents to $1,339.60
an ounce at 12:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price dropped as much as 0.8 percent.  METALS  New York: Copper prices rose in New York, extending a rally to a
27-month high, on signs that global demand will outpace supplies.
*Inventories monitored by the London Metal Exchange have
dropped to the lowest level in a year amid analyst forecasts for
a global shortfall this year and next.
*Copper futures for December delivery rose 0.6 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $3.869 a pound at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex
in New York. Earlier, the metal reached $3.893, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 2008.  OIL  New York: Crude oil was little changed after confidence among
U.S. consumers climbed in October from a seven-month low and the
dollar rose against the yen and euro.
*Crude oil for December delivery rose 3 cents to settle at
$82.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  WHAT TO WATCH
