Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President  William Dudley  said the U.S. economy is gradually
recovering and its “momentum” has slowed in recent months.  “The Great Recession has been followed by a tepid
recovery,” Dudley, 57, said today in the text of a speech in
Rochester, New York. “Since 2009, economic activity has grown,
but not robustly,” he said. “The momentum has slowed.” His
remarks were similar to a speech yesterday in Ithaca, New York.  Dudley, who is also vice chairman of the policy-setting
Federal Open Market Committee, repeated his view that the
central bank will probably need to embark on a second round of
unconventional stimulus to address too-low inflation and a
jobless rate that’s stuck near 10 percent.  The Fed, having reduced interest rates almost to zero and
bought $1.7 trillion in securities, is considering a new round
of asset purchases as the economy shows signs of flagging,
according to the minutes of the FOMC’s Sept. 21 meeting. Policy
makers are also weighing efforts to boost public expectations
that inflation will rise, the minutes said.  Dudley said on Oct. 1 that more unconventional stimulus is
“likely to be warranted” because inflation is too low and
unemployment too high, fueling speculation the  FOMC  will act at
its meeting on Nov. 2-3. He reiterated this view on Oct. 19 and
again yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
