Peruvian villagers protesting for
food aid blocked a river in the northern Amazon jungle,
preventing oil barges from docking, Argentina’s Pluspetrol SA
said.  The company, the largest oil and natural gas producer in
Peru, distributed 730 tons of food and 1,500 tons of water since
a July oilspill in the Maranon River, Pluspetrol said today in
an e-mailed statement. Distribution was halted after an Oct. 19
report by the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute showed no
traces of oil in the river, Pluspetrol said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
