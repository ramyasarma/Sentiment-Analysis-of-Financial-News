A plan to build solar-power
generators in the Sahara desert to feed electricity to the
European Union may ease the continent’s reliance on Russia for
supplies, EU Energy Commissioner  Guenther Oettinger  said.  The 27-nation bloc, which buys about 25 percent of its
natural gas from Moscow-based  OAO Gazprom , needs to consider
generating power in North Africa to diversify its energy
sources, Oettinger said today in Barcelona.  “We need many small dependencies and not one big
dependency,” Oettinger said at a conference. “So maybe Morocco
or Tunisia are additional dependencies to the OPEC states or to
gas from Russia.”  Policymakers and executives are meeting in the Spanish city
this week to build support for Desertec, an initiative that aims
to connect Europe to Saharan solar power through high-voltage
transmission cables. Governments must agree on sharing
investments and supplies before it goes forward.  The world’s deserts receive more energy from the sun every
six hours than the human race consumes in a year, the Desertec
Foundation says on its website.  To realize the potential of Saharan solar energy, the EU
must create an integrated power grid to transfer electricity
between countries, Oettinger said. He said in February he will
present a plan to EU leaders for developing the continent’s
power grid during the next 20 years.  Political Support  “Infrastructure and harmonization are our European
issues,” he said. “I hope to get concrete reactions and,
first, political support from our member states.”  Dii Gmbh , the company created last year to develop the
first trial projects, is backed by Deutsche Bank AG, Siemens AG
and ABB Group as well as the Desertec Foundation.  OAO Gazprom last year cut gas supplies to Ukraine after
accusing the country of siphoning off gas for other countries.
Ukrainian officials denied the charge. The curbs reduced
Europe’s gas supply from Gazprom by about 60 percent, the
company said.  Solar thermal generators may supply as much as 10 percent
of the world’s electricity by 2050 so long as governments ensure
there is sufficient funding for research and provide incentives
for deploying the technology, the International Energy Agency
said in a report this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
