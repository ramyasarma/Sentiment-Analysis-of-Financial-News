AutoTrader.com , which runs a website
linking buyers and sellers of used cars, has agreed to acquire
Kelley Blue Book, a provider of new- and used vehicle
information.  Details of the transaction, which is expected to close by
the end of the year, are not being disclosed, Atlanta-based
AutoTrader said in a statement to PRNewswire today. The price
is about $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported,  Paul Johnson, Kelley Blue’s chief executive officer and the
rest of the “leadership team” will remain in place, according
to the statement. Kelley Blue, founded in 1926, provides auto
information to dealers, banks and insurance companies in the
U.S. on a weekly basis, according to the statement.  “Together we can bring a host of new technologies and
tools to market that will significantly improve the car shopping
process for consumers, and help auto dealers and
manufacturers,” AutoTrader President and CEO Chip Perry said in
the statement.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. acted as Kelley Blue’s financial adviser 
on the sale, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. provided financial 
advice to AutoTrader, the acquiring company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
