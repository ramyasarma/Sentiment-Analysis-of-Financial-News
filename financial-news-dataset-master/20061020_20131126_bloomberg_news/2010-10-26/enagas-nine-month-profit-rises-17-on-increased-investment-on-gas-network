Enagas SA , Spain’s natural-gas grid
company, said third-quarter profit rose 15 percent after
starting operations on more assets that earn a fixed return.  Net income  rose to 89.8 million euros ($125 million) from
78 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company said
today in a filing, beating the 85.9 million-euro average
estimate in a  Bloomberg survey  of analysts. Nine-month profit
gained 17 percent to 254.9 million euros.  Enagas, which gets a fixed return on investments and makes
money from transporting gas, has purchased assets and expanded
its network. Chief Executive Officer  Antonio Llarden  forecasts
net income will rise an average of at least 7 percent a year
from 2009 through 2014 after growing about 10 percent this year.  “These good results are higher than estimated and higher
than the company’s guidance, and continue to reflect the good
operating momentum this year,” said  Antonio Cruz-Guzman , an
analyst at Banesto Bolsa SA in Madrid who has an “overweight”
rating on the stock.  Enagas  shares fell 0.7 percent to 15.235 euros at 1:05 p.m.
in Madrid. They are down 1.2 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 3.64 billion euros.  The company plans to put 3.4 billion euros of assets in
operation through 2014, or about 680 million euros a year, up
from an average of 550 million euros in 2007 through 2009,
Enagas said on July 20. It will invest 3.5 billion euros through
2014, or 700 million euros a year, compared with 730 million
euros a year in the previous three years.  Investments  This year, Enagas will invest more than the 700 million
euros it had forecast after it made acquisitions, Llarden said
on a conference call. Enagas on July 27 said it bought an 18
percent stake in the Gaviota gas storage site from Murphy Spain
Oil Co. and on Sept. 3, it announced the purchase of 15 percent
in the Bahia de Bizkaia Gas regasification plant in Bilbao from
Repsol YPF SA.  Enagas invested 559.1 million euros in the first nine
months and started operating 190.7 million euros of assets,
including a compression station in Montesa. Nine-month sales
from regulated operations rose 12 percent to 719 million euros.  The company plans to start three liquefied natural gas
tanks at plants in Barcelona, Huelva and Cartagena in the fourth
quarter.  Net debt  climbed to 2.97 billion euros in September from
2.8 billion euros a year earlier and the average cost of debt
fell to 2.68 percent from 3.10 percent. Enagas estimates debt
will rise to 3.27 billion euros at the end of this year.  Enagas is investing in liquefied natural gas terminals and
is already building the El Musel regasification plant. The
company runs three of Spain’s six regasification terminals that
turn the liquefied fuel back into gas. Spain is Europe’s biggest
importer of LNG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
