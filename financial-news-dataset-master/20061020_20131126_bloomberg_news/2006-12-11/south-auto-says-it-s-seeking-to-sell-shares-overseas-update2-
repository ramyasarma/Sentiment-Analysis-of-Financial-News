             China South Automobile Co., parent of
the Chinese partner of  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , said
it's aiming to sell shares in Hong Kong or the U.S. next year to
fund its expansion plans.  
 ``We're looking at raising stocks abroad because we need to
tap the financial markets overseas,'' South Auto President Yin Jiaxu said today. ``We're aiming for that to happen in 2007.''  
 South Auto may follow SAIC Motor Corp. in tapping capital
markets to fund expansion in the world's fastest-growing major
vehicle market. Vehicle sales in the country rose 26 percent in
the first 10 months of 2006 to 5.77 million units.  
 South Auto has invited Ford, Mazda,  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  and
other companies to invest when it sells shares, the South China
Morning Post reported on Oct. 20, citing Yin. The company may
raise about $500 million in an initial public offering in Hong
Kong as early as next year, the report added.  
 The company could get approval to list in Hong Kong within
25 days of getting permission to sale shares from the Chinese
regulator, Yin said today in a live telecast of an event to mark
China's fifth anniversary as a World Trade Organization member.  
 South Auto is the largest shareholder in  Chongqing Changan
Automobile Co. (200625) , which makes vehicles with Ford, Mazda and Suzuki
in China. Changan Auto's net income more than doubled to 533.3
million  yuan  in the nine months to Sept. 30, it said on Oct 18.  
 Changan Auto's yuan-denominated shares rose 5.4 percent to
6.81 yuan today. The stock has risen 87 percent this year.  
 SAIC Motor received approval to sell 19.1 billion yuan of
assets, including stakes in ventures with General Motors Corp.
and Volkswagen AG, to its listed unit, Shanghai Automotive Co.
last month.
