             Russian stocks fell, with the
benchmark  RTS Index (RTSI$)  sliding from a record and posting its first
loss in 15 sessions. OAO  Gazprom (GAZP)  and OAO  Lukoil (LKOH)  led the decline
after crude oil dropped in New York.  
 The dollar-denominated RTS Index lost 0.7 percent to
1,838.61 at the close of trading in Moscow. The measure today
touched an intraday record of 1860.14. It gained 10 percent in
the previous 14 trading days, its longest winning streak ever.
The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.1 percent to 1611.67.  
 Gazprom, the world's biggest natural-gas company, fell 2.1
percent to $11.48. Lukoil, Russia's largest oil producer,
decreased 1.3 percent to $89.50. Crude oil for January delivery
lost as much as 1.3 percent to $61.25 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  
 Oil fell amid skepticism that any OPEC decision at a
meeting in Nigeria on Dec. 14 will reduce a surplus in global
supply. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the
producer of about 40 percent of the world's oil, will consider a
second reduction in three months. Stockpiles in the U.S., the
world's largest consumer, have risen 5.3 percent in the past
year.  
 Russia  is the world's second-largest oil supplier and
energy companies make up more than half of the RTS Index. The
measure has surged 70 percent in the past 12 months, compared
with a 28 percent gain for the Morgan Stanley Capital
International's Emerging Markets Index, a global benchmark.  
 Higher Price Estimate  
 OAO Sberbank (SBER) , the country's biggest lender, climbed 2.4
percent to a record $2,861, valuing the company at $57 billion.
Merrill Lynch & Co. raised its price estimate on the shares by
36 percent to $3,400 after increasing the forecast for the
bank's earnings this year and next.  
 Sberbank will benefit from surging mortgages in Russia and
a planned sale of new shares, Merrill Lynch analyst  Paul Tucker 
wrote in a report today. The lender aims to sell 198 billion
rubles ($7.6 billion) of new shares early next year, Economy
Minister  German Gref  said Dec. 6.  
 ``The extra liquidity, and the proposed removal of some
foreign ownership hurdles will be net positive,'' Tucker said.
``The country still has fewer than 200,000 mortgages -- and we
think this will be the next great story.''  
 OAO Uralsvyazinform, Russia's fixed-line telephone monopoly
in the Urals region, surged 8.5 percent to a record 5.35 cents,
the biggest one-day gain in more than four months. OAO Central
Telecommunication Company, which operates in central Russia,
gained 3 percent to 68 cents. OAO VolgaTelecom, a provider of
fixed-line services in the Volga region, advanced 1.8 percent to
$4.55.  
 Acquisition  
 OAO Comstar United Telesystems approved the acquisition of
a 25 percent plus one share stake in the operators' parent
holding OAO Svyazinvest from billionaires Leonard Blavatnik and
 Viktor Vekselberg  over the weekend, Reuters reported today,
citing unidentified banking sources. The stake in the state
holding is valued at $1.3 billion, according to the  news agency .  
 Irina Potekhina, a spokeswoman at AFK Sistema holding,
which controls Comstar, said ``there is no purchase.'' Comstar's
head of investor relations Maria Yeliseyeva could neither
confirm nor deny the deal. The company will have a board meeting
tomorrow, she said.  
 Shares of Comstar increased 1.2 percent to $7 in London.
