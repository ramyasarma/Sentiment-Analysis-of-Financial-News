             Aber Diamond Corp., owner of retail
jeweler  Harry Winston , rose the most in about 15 months on the
Toronto Stock Exchange after a wire service reported the company
may increase its stake in a Canadian diamond mine.  
 The shares rose C$2.65, or 6.6 percent, to C$42.79 at 4:10
p.m. in composite trading, the biggest gain since July 4, 2006.
Toronto-based Aber's shares have risen 20 percent in the past
year.  
 Aber, owner of 40 percent of the Diavik mine in the
Northwest Territories, would be interested in buying the
remaining 60 percent stake if  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  was willing to sell,
the Canadian Press reported, citing Aber Chief Executive Officer
Robert Gannicott. Gannicott said Toronto-based Aber had a first
right of refusal on Rio's investment in the mine.  
 Australia 's Herald Sun newspaper reported earlier this week
that Rio may sell its diamond operations, including Diavik, as
part of its planned takeover of Alcan Inc., citing unidentified
people.
