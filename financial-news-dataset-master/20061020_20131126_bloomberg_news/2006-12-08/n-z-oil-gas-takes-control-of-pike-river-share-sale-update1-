             New Zealand Oil & Gas Ltd. (NZO)  said it
will manage the sale of shares in its Pike River Coal Ltd. unit
after three of the miner's directors resigned.  
 Pike River, 61 percent-owned by  New Zealand Oil & Gas (NZO) , is
planning to sell shares in February to help fund the NZ$144
million ($99 million) development on the nation's South Island.
Shareholders in the Wellington-based oil explorer will be
offered one Pike share for every eight New Zealand Oil & Gas
shares held.  
 ``To ensure these objectives are met in the most effective
manner, NZOG has taken direct control of the process,'' the
company said in a statement to the New Zealand stock exchange.  
 The Pike River mine, near Greymouth, is part-owned by
Saurashtra Fuels Pvt. and  India 's  Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd. (GNC)  It will
become New Zealand's second-biggest export coal mine when full
output of 1.3 million tons a year is reached after two years.  
 Former Pike River Chairman Denis Wood and directors James Ogden and Graeme Duncan resigned from the board for personal
reasons, New Zealand Oil & Gas said without elaborating.  
 ``We're not prepared to say any more than that,'' Wood said
in an interview. ``I just wish the project well.''  
 New Zealand Oil & gas shares fell 2 cents to NZ$1.02 at
1:35 p.m. in Wellington.  
 Tunneling and site preparation has started at Pike River,
which is scheduled to start producing low-ash and low-phosphorus
coking coal late next year.  
 The project is proceeding well and the board is confident
the share-sale timetable will be achieved, Pike Chairman Ray Meyer said in the statement.
