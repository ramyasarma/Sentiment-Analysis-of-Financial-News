             Scottish & Newcastle Plc, which is in a
legal battle with  Carlsberg A/S (CARLA)  over their Russian joint venture,
said arbitration of the dispute will be resolved within six months.  
 ``The final award shall be made by July 3, 2008,'' Edinburgh-
based Scottish & Newcastle said today in a statement, citing a
letter from the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to both brewers.
Carlsberg does not expect a resolution in the case for at least a
year, spokesman Jens Peter Skaarup said.  
 Scottish & Newcastle, the largest U.K. beermaker, began
arbitration in October after Carlsberg and  Heineken NV (HEIA)  made an
unsolicited takeover proposal. Scottish & Newcastle and Valby,
Denmark-based Carlsberg share control of Baltic Beverages
Holding AB, the biggest brewer in  Russia .  
 ``It's still our understanding that it will take at least
12 months,'' Skaarup said today in a telephone interview. ``We
have our doubts they will be able to resolve the case by July.''  
 Scottish & Newcastle  shares  slipped 0.5 penny, or 0.1
percent, to 734.5 pence in  London . Carlsberg stock declined 12
kroner, or 2 percent, to 604 kroner in Copenhagen and Heineken
fell 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 43.78 euros in Amsterdam.  
 The British brewer has rejected both the first bid approach
from Carlsberg and Heineken and a sweetened proposal worth 7.3
billion pounds ($15 billion) as too low.
