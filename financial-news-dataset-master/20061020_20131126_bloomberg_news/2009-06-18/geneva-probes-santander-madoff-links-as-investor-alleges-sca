             Geneva’s public prosecutor has opened a criminal probe into allegations that  Banco Santander SA’s (SAN)  Optimal Investment Services defrauded clients by misrepresenting its relationship with  Bernard Madoff .    Prosecutor Dario Zanni said he appointed a magistrate to investigate the complaint filed by Franck Berlamont, head of Geneva Partners, an independent asset manager. Optimal clients lost about 2.3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) on investments with Madoff, who pleaded guilty to 11 counts of fraud after running a $65 billion  Ponzi scheme  and is awaiting sentencing on June 29.    Optimal’s prospectus said it managed the firm’s Madoff- linked investments and had conducted a full review of Madoff, which included analyzing trades, visiting his  New York  office, and interviewing his chief risk and chief financial officers, Berlamont said in an interview. Now the Geneva-based unit of  Spain’s biggest bank  says it isn’t liable for the losses because Madoff managed the investments.    “I was scammed by my neighbors,” Berlamont said in his office overlooking Lake Geneva. “Santander and Optimal repeatedly presented false information to investors, and the list of false or misleading statements is simply mind boggling.”    A Santander spokesman declined to comment on the complaint. About 93 percent of Santander’s individual private banking clients have accepted the company’s compensation offer for Madoff-related losses, he said. The offer doesn’t apply to institutional clients such as Berlamont.    Magistrate Marc Tappolet will investigate Berlamont’s complaint, Zanni said. In April, Tappolet charged five directors of Aurelia Finance SA with criminal mismanagement of client assets related to Madoff investments.    ‘Life of Hell’    In the U.S., investors are directing their anger at Madoff, 71, who used the money from new clients to pay off old ones. The former money manager’s victims have written 113 letters telling the judge who will sentence Madoff that he deserves “no forgiveness.”    “He has condemned his investors to a life of hell, while his hell will be the prison you sentence him to,” wrote Emma De Vita, 81, an investor from Chalfont,  Pennsylvania .    Irving Picard , the bankruptcy trustee liquidating Madoff’s firm, has said he found no evidence that Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC made any stock trades on behalf of clients for as long as 13 years.    Berlamont, who  manages  less than $300 million, said he decided to invest through Optimal in 2007 because he wanted the security offered by the oversight of a larger institution. Optimal employed 73 people, according to its due diligence report dated April 30, 2008. Berlamont said he put about 10 percent of his private clients’ holdings in the Optimal Strategic U.S. Equity product, as well as some of his own money.    ‘Very Secretive’    Optimal began investing with Madoff in 1996.    “It should be noted that Madoff is very secretive and has a policy of requiring its clients of not disclosing its name in any documents,” Optimal’s lawyers wrote in a four-page memo to Manuel Echeverria, then the firm’s chief executive and chief investment officer, prior to meetings with Madoff in 2002.    The meetings on Sept. 18-19, 2002, were designed to limit Madoff’s “potential discretion” over the funds and “reduce any potential exposure” for Optimal, the firm’s lawyers said in a five-page memo that was written after the talks on stationery bearing Optimal’s name and address and Santander’s logo.    As a result of the meetings, Optimal decided to appoint a unit of Bank of Bermuda Group as custodian of the fund, with Madoff as sub-custodian.    “The new custodian will keep all the exposure/ responsibility in case of liquidation of the fund as neither Madoff nor any of the Santander entities will be disclosed in the prospectus as custodian,” according to the memo.    Contradictory Statements    Optimal  had $10.4 billion under management in April last year, according to the 30-page due diligence report, which covers the firm’s entire fund of hedge funds business. The firm said Jan. 27 it planned to  close seven funds  after a surge of withdrawals following disclosure of Madoff-related losses.    The due diligence report says that “investment decisions are made by the investment committee.”    The four-page memo written before the 2002 meetings proposed that different language be added to Optimal’s agreement with Madoff.    “All investment decisions in the account at BLM are effected by persons associated with BLM,” the suggested language reads, referring to Bernard L. Madoff.    ‘Can’t Have It Both Ways’    The conflict between those two statements is at the heart of Berlamont’s complaint, said his  attorney , Carlo Lombardini, who is also involved in the Aurelia complaint.    “When you ask someone to invest your money and they produce a prospectus saying that they manage the assets, when in fact it’s managed by a third party, there’s a serious case to answer,” Lombardini said.    “Everyone was happy to say that it was their  product  when times were good, but when things turn bad they say it was a fraud and nothing to do with them. They can’t have it both ways.”    Lombardini’s arguments may be rejected by the courts, which tend to favor bankers, said Anton Keller, secretary of the Swiss Investors Protection Association.    “Swiss lawyers and judges seem to have built into their DNA that in case of doubt at least, both foreign and Swiss institutions must be protected above the individual,” Keller said. “They’ll throw out cases on the flimsiest of grounds, which is why we favor direct negotiations, arbitration and parliamentary interventions.”    To contact the reporter on this story: Warren Giles in Geneva at  wgiles@bloomberg.net     To contact the editor responsible for this story: Frank Connelly at  fconnelly@bloomberg.net
