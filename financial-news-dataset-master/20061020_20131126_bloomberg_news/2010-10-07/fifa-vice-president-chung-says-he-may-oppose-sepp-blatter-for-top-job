FIFA  vice-president  Chung Mong-joon 
may oppose  Sepp Blatter  for the role of head of soccer’s
governing body, the South Korean said today.  “It’s still too early to say there would be no contender
next May,” Chung told delegates at the Leaders in Football
conference in London today.  When asked about his own intentions, Chung said he would
“think about it.”  The election for the FIFA presidency will take place in May
2011. Blatter, from Switzerland, has been at the helm since
1998.  FIFA’s “governance must be global, democratic and
accountable,” Chung said. “President Blatter once said,
‘change is most durable.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
