Vacancies at U.S. neighborhood and
community shopping centers rose in the third quarter as
unemployment lingered near a 26-year high and consumer
confidence fell, according to  Reis Inc.   The vacancy rate at shopping  centers  climbed to 10.9
percent from 10.3 percent a year earlier, the New York-based
property research firm said today in a statement. Vacancies were
unchanged from the second quarter, when they reached the highest
level since 1991. The record of 11.1 percent was set in 1990,
according to Reis data going back 30 years.  Retailers and their landlords are being hurt by a U.S.
jobless rate that was  9.6 percent  in August and has been close
to 10 percent for more than a year. The Conference Board’s  index 
of consumer confidence fell to 48.5 last month, the lowest level
since February, the New York-based private research group said.  “Even if we see a resumption in consumer confidence and a
rise in retail spending, retail properties typically lag
recoveries by anywhere from 12 to 18 months,”  Victor Calanog ,
director of research at Reis, said in the statement.  Landlords’ asking rents dropped to $19.07 a square foot
from $19.26 a year earlier and were unchanged from the prior
three months. Effective rents, or what tenants actually pay,
fell to an average $16.58 from $16.94 a year earlier, also
unchanged from the second quarter.  At regional and superregional malls, vacancies rose to 8.8
percent from 8.6 percent a year earlier, Reis said. They fell
from 9 percent in the second quarter.  Department Stores  Regional malls typically include department stores and
fashion and general merchandise retailers and range in size from
400,000 to 800,000 square feet (37,000 to 74,000 square meters),
according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Super-regional malls, including the  Mall of America  in
Minnesota, South Coast Plaza in Southern California and Tysons
Corner Center in Virginia, are defined as those larger than
800,000 square feet.  Neighborhood shopping centers tend to be 30,000 to 150,000
square feet and mainly house convenience retailers. Community
 shopping centers  are 100,000 to 350,000 square feet and may
include a discount department, home-improvement or grocery
store.  To contact the reporter on this story:
