KazMunaiGaz National Co. , a Kazakh
state-owned energy company, may borrow $14 billion to fund
developments through 2014 and probably won’t sell stock in an
initial public offering.  The company may borrow 70 percent of its $20 billion
investment program for 2010 to 2014, Chief Executive Officer
 Kairgeldy Kabyldin  said today in Almaty. The Kazakh state energy
company sees no economic advantage from an IPO in current market
conditions, he said.  KazMunaiGaz said in April the investments will include $1.5
billion to $2.5 billion a year for the Kashagan development, one
of the world’s biggest oil discoveries in the last 40 years. The
company, which accounts for 24 percent of the Central Asian
nation’s oil production, has $11 billion of bonds and loans
outstanding, with peak debt payment of $2.7 billion next year,
according to Bloomberg  data .  The Kazakh government will decide this year or in early
2011 whether to sell KazMunaiGaz stock in an IPO, Kairat
Kelimbetov, chief executive officer of the National Wellbeing
Fund Samruk-Kazyna, said yesterday. The fund holds the state
stake in KazMunaiGaz.  KazMunaiGaz’s investment plans for projects such as
Kashagan may require the state to dip into its National Oil
Fund, Kelimbetov said on Oct. 6. He didn’t specify when it might
become necessary.  Transfer to KazMunaiGas EP  “We considered transferring the state-owned stake in
Kashagan to KazMunaiGas Exploration Production from the parent,
but this won’t solve the problem,” Kelimbetov said, referring
to the national company’s London-traded oil production unit.  Borrowing will help cover the state company’s needs,
including cash for Kashagan,  Timur Kulibayev , a deputy head of
the Samruk-Kazyna, said on Oct. 5.  KazMunaiGaz, the majority owner of Rompetrol Group, had to
repay 571 million euros ($800 million) of bonds held by the
Romanian state in exchange for the refiner’s historical debt in
September. Rompetrol, the owner of Romania’s second-biggest oil
refiner, faces legal action over its decision to convert part of
its debt into shares, the European country’s government said on
Oct. 1.  KazMunaiGaz plans to reach an agreement with Romania on the
debt this year, Kabyldin said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
