Yemen’s budget deficit reached 507
billion rials last year, exceeding government expectations by 80
billion rials, the Yemen Observer cited Finance Minister Noman
al-Suhaibi as saying yesterday.  Al-Suhaibi said the deficit was largely due to a decrease
in investment and ongoing subsidies for oil derivatives, the
weekly newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
