Volkswagen AG’s Audi unit increased
its worldwide sales in September by 16 percent, to 102,650 cars
and sport-utility vehicles, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. The increase was driven by deliveries in China, which
rose 45 percent, the company said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
