India’s stocks fluctuated. Exporters
fell after a U.S. report raised concern about the global
economic recovery. Consumer-related shares gained as the
International Monetary Fund raised the nation’s growth outlook.  Infosys Techologies Ltd. , the second-largest software
services provider, lost 0.9 percent. Private payrolls in the
U.S. unexpectedly fell, ADP Employer Services reported
yesterday. Indian software companies get about half of their
sales in the world’s largest economy.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , a
household products maker, rose for the first time in four days.
 Bharti Airtel Ltd. , a mobile-phone operator, gained the most in
two weeks. The IMF cited strengthening consumer demand for its
higher economic expansion forecast.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex , was
little changed at 20,534.63 at 1:43 p.m. in Mumbai after
swinging between gains and losses at least nine times. The S&P
CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost 0.1 percent
to 6,182.95. The  BSE 200 Index  advanced 0.2 percent to 2,617.51.  “Opinions are divided between investors who think India’s
markets will gain and those who think there will be a
correction,” said Gajendra Nagpal, chief executive officer of
Unicon Financial Intermediaries Pvt., a brokerage in New Delhi.
“Foreigners are more gung-ho about our markets than local
investors because they have limited options and India’s growth
stands out.”  Sensex Record  The Sensex has gained 28 percent from the May 25 low,
approaching the record closing high of 20,873.33 on Jan. 8,
2008. The gauge is the best performer this year among the
world’s 10 biggest stock markets. The measure climbed 12 percent
last month, the most since May 2009.  Infosys declined 0.9 percent to 3,076.5 rupees. Wipro Ltd.,
India’s third-largest software-services provider, lost 0.6
percent to 462 rupees. U.S. companies cut 39,000 jobs last
month. Economists had predicted 20,000 would be added, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Hindustan Unilever, the maker of Knorr soups and Lux soap,
added 0.8 percent to 303.4 rupees. Bharti advanced 1.4 percent
to 357.15 rupees.  The South Asian economy will expand 9.7 percent this year,
the  Washington-based lender  said in its World Economic Outlook
yesterday, more than the 9.4 percent estimated in July. The IMF
lowered its prediction for global expansion to 4.2 percent, from
4.3 percent, citing unemployment, public debt and fragile
banking systems.  “Low reliance on exports, accommodative policies, and
strong capital inflows have supported domestic activity and
growth,” the IMF said in the report. “The rapid pace of
domestic activity, evidenced by rapidly rising inflation, led
the central bank to increase the repo policy rate.”  Overseas  funds  bought a net  9.7 billion rupees  ($217
million) of Indian equities on Oct. 5, extending this year’s
record inflows to 939.7 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
