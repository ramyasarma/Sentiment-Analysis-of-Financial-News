euro’s appreciation against major currencies puts undue strains
on the European economy as it struggles to recover from the

in the adjustment of global exchange rates,” commission

the Americans.”  China hasn’t taken “concrete action” to follow up a June
9 pledge to let its currency float, Altafaj said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
