Rubber advanced for a third day as
wet weather disrupted tapping in Thailand, limiting supply from
the world’s largest producer and exporter.  The March-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.6 percent
to 323.5 yen per kilogram ($3,901 a metric ton) before trading
at 322.5 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:54 a.m. The
price rose to 324.1 yen yesterday, the highest level for the
most-active contract since April 26.  Shippers in Thailand have raised offers for RSS-3 grade
rubber for November shipment to around $3.70 a kilogram, from
$3.60 at the end of last week, said Kazuhiko Saito, an analyst
at commodity broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  “Shipments from Thailand slowed as heavy rain constrained
latex output in the nation’s main producing areas,” Saito said
today by phone.  Gains in futures were limited after Japan’s currency
climbed to a 15-year high against the dollar, weakening the
appeal of yen-denominated contracts, he said.  The dollar was at 82.94 yen at 11:42 a.m. in Tokyo after
sinking to 82.77 yesterday, the weakest level since May 1995 and
lower than the rate on Sept. 15, when Japan intervened in the
currency market for the first time since 2004.  The dollar came under pressure amid growing expectations
that the Federal Reserve will expand credit-easing steps to
sustain the U.S. recovery. The yen also advanced on prospects
that Japan will avoid currency-market intervention before this
week’s meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the
Group of Seven industrialized nations.  Low Risk Appetite  “Investors’ risk appetite isn’t strong before the release
of U.S. jobs data, as they are bracing for weak numbers,” Saito
at Fujitomi said.  U.S. initial  jobless claims  likely increased by 2,000 to
455,000 in the week ended Oct. 2, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before the data is released today. The
unemployment rate climbed to 9.7 percent in September from 9.6
percent in August, according to a separate survey.  As the stimulus-led recovery failed to create jobs,
companies in the U.S. unexpectedly cut payroll by 39,000 in
September, according to figures from ADP Employment. The median
of a Bloomberg News survey of 37 economists projected an
increase of 20,000 jobs.  The auctioned price of ribbed smoked sheets in Thailand
grew 1.3 percent to 105.6 baht ($3.52), the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand said yesterday on its website.  The Shanghai market is closed for National Day holidays and
will resume trade tomorrow. Natural-rubber inventories expanded
4,680 tons to 31,580 tons, based on a survey of 10 warehouses,
the exchange said Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
