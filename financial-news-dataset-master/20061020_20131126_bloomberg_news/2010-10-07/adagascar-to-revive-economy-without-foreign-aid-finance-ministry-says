Madagascar’s government plans to
revive economic growth next year without resorting to loans or
grants from abroad, said the cabinet director of the Finance and
Budget Ministry,  Hugues Rajaonson .  The government has “its own resources to make the economy
work,” Rajaonson said in an interview in the capital,
Antananarivo, yesterday. “We don’t need one dollar from abroad
or any of their help in how to manage our economy. We have the
same diplomas as them.”  Madagascar was suspended from the African Union and had all
non-humanitarian aid cut after the mayor of Antananarivo,  Andry Rajoelina , ousted his predecessor President  Marc Ravalomanana 
last year with the help of the military. Foreign aid previously
accounted for about two thirds of fiscal spending. The IMF is
withdrawing its representative from the Indian Ocean island
until the political crisis is resolved.  The government can fund its spending through tax revenue,
Rajaonson said, without giving details. In September, the budget
for all ministries was cut by 40 percent.  Madagascar’s economy will contract 2 percent this year, the
only African economy to shrink, according to forecasts by the
 International Monetary Fund . The government estimates expansion
of 0.8 percent.  “We have a strategy but we are not going to tell it to
anyone, even the World Bank,” Rajaonson said. “We have nothing
to see until we do the budget,” which should be published by
Jan. 3, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
