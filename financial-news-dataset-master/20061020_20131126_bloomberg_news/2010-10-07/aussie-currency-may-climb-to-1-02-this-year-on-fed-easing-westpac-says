The Australian dollar will rise above
parity with the greenback this year on prospects the Federal
Reserve will boost U.S. asset purchases and the Reserve Bank of
Australia will increase interest rates, according to Westpac
Banking Corp.  “Over the course of the next nine months we expect the
Reserve Bank will raise the overnight cash rate by 75 basis
points,”  Bill Evans , chief economist at the Sydney-based bank,
wrote in a note today. “The Australian dollar will stand out as
one of the few liquid, floating currencies where the central
bank is not printing money -- indeed it is tightening policy.”  The Australian currency is likely to reach $1.02 by year-
end and climb to $1.05 by June of 2011, the note said.
Australia’s currency was at 98.34 U.S. cents at 3:37 p.m. in
Sydney from 98.25 cents in New York yesterday, when it touched
99.18, the strongest since exchange controls ended in 1983.  Westpac expects the Fed to add to quantitative easing by
$1.5 trillion, up from its previous estimate of $800 billion,
the research note said. The Fed and other central banks are
likely to follow the Bank of Japan, which announced on Oct. 5 it
will expand its balance sheet by 5 trillion yen ($61 billion),
Westpac said.  “We doubt whether the currency markets have fully priced
such a large quantitative easing task,” Evans wrote. “That
means that further U.S. dollar weakness is likely over the
course of the remainder of 2010 and through to at least the
first half of 2011.”  Westpac was the second-best foreign-exchange forecaster for
the six quarters ended Sept. 30, behind Standard Chartered Plc,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Standard Chartered
prevailed over 43 other firms to be the most accurate predictor
of currencies across eight currency pairs, with an average
margin error of 3.79 percent. Westpac rose to second from ninth,
with a 4.93 percent margin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
