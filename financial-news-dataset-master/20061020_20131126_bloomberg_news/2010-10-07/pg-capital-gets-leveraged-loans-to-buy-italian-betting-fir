TPG Capital’s investment unit and
Monitor Clipper Partners got leveraged financing for the buyout
of Italian online betting service-provider Microgame SpA, a
person familiar with the matter said.  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and UniCredit SpA underwrote
45 million euros ($63 million) of loans for the acquisition,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
information is private.  Peter Laino , managing partner of Monitor Clipper, and a
spokesman for TPG weren’t immediately available to comment.  TPG Growth, with more than $2.5 billion under management,
agreed to partner with Monitor Clipper to be the principal
shareholders of Microgame, the Benevento, Italy-based company
 said  in June.  The five-year facility comprises a 40 million-euro term
loan and a 5 million-euro revolving credit, both paying an
interest margin of 425 basis points more than the
euro interbank offered rate, said the person. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Microgame, founded in 1996, has about 30 percent of the
market in online poker and sport betting, according to its
website. The company had 250 million euros of sales in 2009
after its customers generated total gaming revenues of more than
1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
