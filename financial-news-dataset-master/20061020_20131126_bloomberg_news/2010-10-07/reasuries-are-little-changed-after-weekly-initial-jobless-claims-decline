Yields on 30-year  Treasuries  rose to
their highest since June relative to bonds that protect against
faster inflation as investors step up bets that the Federal
Reserve will be successful in sparking consumer prices as it
prints money to bolster the economic recovery.  The gap in  yields  between 30-year bonds and similar maturity
inflation-indexed debt widened to the most since June as
speculation increases that the central bank will resume buying
Treasuries to keep borrowing rates low in a strategy called
quantitative easing. The break-even rate, an indication of
inflation expectations over the life of the securities, reached
2.29 percentage points yesterday, the most since June 29. That’s
up from a 15-month low of 1.84 percentage points Aug. 25.  “The whole idea of QE is to raise inflation expectations
so that inflation is equal to or higher than what the Fed
wants,” said  Alex Li , an interest-rate strategist in New York
at Deutsche Bank AG, one of the 18 primary dealers that trade
with the central bank. “That’s the key message the Fed is
trying to send.”  The yield on the  30-year bond  rose 5 basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 3.71 percent at 4:41 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.875
percent security due in August 2040 fell 26/32, or $8.13 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 7/8. The break-even rate with 30-year
TIPS was 2.28 percent.  Benchmark 10-year note yields slipped 1 basis point to 2.38
percent. They reached 2.3552 percent yesterday, the lowest level
since January 2009.  ‘Virtually Certain’  Two-year note  yields  fell to the least ever, their fifth
consecutive day of setting or matching a record low, before data
tomorrow that’s forecast to show a rise in the unemployment
rate, pointing to a slowing recovery. The yields fell 3 basis
points to 0.3512 percent.  “It is virtually certain that the Fed will kick off any
plans to restart quantitative easing if tomorrow’s report
doesn’t offer any reason for optimism,” said  Kevin Giddis ,
president of fixed-income capital markets at brokerage firm
Morgan Keegan Inc. in Memphis, Tennessee, wrote in a note to
clients.  Treasury 10-year notes were little changed earlier after a
government report showed first-time applications for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week.  Initial jobless  claims dropped by 11,000 to 445,000 in the
week ended Oct. 2, the fewest since July 10, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. Economists in a Bloomberg
News survey projected a rise to 455,000 new claims.  Payrolls Data  Employment data due tomorrow from the department are
forecast in separate Bloomberg surveys to show overall nonfarm
payrolls lost 5,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment
rate rose to 9.7 percent, from 9.6 percent in August.  “Tomorrow’s payroll number is much bigger for the
market,” said  Michael Pond , an interest-rate strategist in New
York at primary dealer Barclays Plc. “The labor market is not
out of the woods.”  Treasuries rallied yesterday after a report showing an
unexpected decrease in U.S. jobs fueled speculation the Fed will
decide to buy more debt as soon as its next meeting on Nov. 2-3.
ADP Employer Services data showed employers cut 39,000
positions, compared with a Bloomberg survey forecast for a
20,000-job gain.  Yields have slid this week as investors bet the Fed will
follow the Bank of Japan in purchasing more bonds, a strategy
known as quantitative easing.  Calls for Action  New York Fed President  William Dudley , the Boston Fed’s
 Eric Rosengren  and Chicago’s  Charles Evans  all advocated further
action. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Oct. 4 that restarting
large-scale asset purchases would probably spur growth. The bank
has a duty to aid the economy as unemployment holds near 10
percent, he said last week. The Fed bought $1.7 trillion worth
of Treasury and mortgage debt in a program that ended in March
that Bernanke said improved the economy.  Investors are demanding near-record amounts of yield to
own 30-year bonds instead of 5-year notes because of speculation
the central bank will focus on shorter-maturity debt if policy
makers expand purchases of government securities.  The  spread  between the yields on the two maturities reached
2.59 percentage points today, the widest since touching 2.6
percentage points on Aug. 11, from 2.58 percentage points
yesterday.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in 3-year notes on Oct. 12,
$21 billion in 10-year securities the next day and $13 billion
in 30-year bonds on Oct. 14, the Treasury Department said today.
The $66 billion total compares with $67 billion in September,
the last time the government sold this combination of
securities.  Treasuries have returned investors 9.3 percent this year,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index, compared
with a loss of 2.1 percent for the same period in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
