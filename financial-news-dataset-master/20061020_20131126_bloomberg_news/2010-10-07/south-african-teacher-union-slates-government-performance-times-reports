One of South Africa’s largest labor
unions said the government, which it supported in elections, was
focused purely on “publicity stunts” and wasn’t combating
poverty and unemployment, the  Times  reported.  The government has used its power to distribute patronage
within its ranks since the current leadership of the African
National Congress gained control in 2007, South African
Democratic Teachers’ Union President Thobile Ntola said,
according to the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
