Copper prices fell the most in 11
weeks on concern that this week’s rally to a 27-month high was
overdone.  The 14-day relative-strength index, a gauge of price
momentum, was above 70 in the two previous days, indicating the
metal was poised to drop. Yesterday, copper reached $3.7895 a
pound, the highest level since price since July 11, 2008. The
price jumped 24 percent in the third quarter.  “These rallies are starting to look tired,” said  Michael K. Smith , the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St.
Lucie, Florida. “Technically, we are overbought and due for a
quick correction.”  Copper futures for December delivery fell 7.35 cents, or
2 percent, to close at $3.6795 at 1:23 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since
July 16.  The rally probably will resume, sending prices above the
record $4.2605 within six months, because of the dollar’s slump
and rising demand from emerging markets including India, Brazil
and China, the world’s largest metal user, Smith said.  Deteriorating mine productivity is “among the most
important constraints on supply,” the International Monetary
Fund said yesterday in a report. “The medium-term balance of
risks for prices should remain tilted toward the upside.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $159, or 1.9 percent, to $8,100 a metric ton
($3.67 a pound).  Copper above $8,000 is “not stable” because that level is
“many times above the cost of production,” said Viktor
Sprogis, the deputy chief executive officer at OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel in Moscow. The company supplies about 3 percent of global
copper.  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also fell on the LME.  To contact the reporter on the story:
