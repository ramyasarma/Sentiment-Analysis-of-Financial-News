New Zealand’s high commissioner in
India has apologized to the country’s External Affairs ministry
over comments made by Television New Zealand presenter Paul
Henry, the Dominion Post  reported .  The ministry handed High Commissioner Rupert Holborow a
formal protest after Henry made comments about the pronunciation
of Delhi chief minister  Sheila Dikshit ’s name, the Wellington-
based newspaper said.  Holborow conveyed “deep regret” for the “culturally
insensitive, inappropriate and vulgar” remarks and would
personally apologize to Dikshit, the newspaper reported, citing
a statement from the high commissioner.  Henry was suspended without pay for two weeks on Oct. 5
after asking Prime Minister  John Key  whether the country’s next
governor-general would be someone who “looks and sounds like a
New Zealander”, in reference to current Governor-General  Anand Satyanand ’s Fiji-Indian heritage, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
