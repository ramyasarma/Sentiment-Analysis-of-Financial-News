National Investments Co., controlled
by Kuwait’s Kharafi Group, is in the process of transferring
shares it obtained for the sale of 46 percent of Mobile
Telecommunications Co., known as  Zain , to Etisalat.  “We have secured the shares and we are processing the
documents for the transfer,” National Investments General
Manager  Hamad al-Ameeri  said today in a phone interview. An
“alliance” to transfer the shares has been made with Zain
shareholders who each own less than 300,000 shares, he said.  Etisalat, as  Emirates Telecommunications Corp.  is known,
offered 1.7 Kuwaiti dinars ($6) a share for a majority stake in
Zain, Kuwait’s largest mobile-phone company. The Kharafi Group
is the second-largest shareholder in Zain, with about 13
percent. Kuwait Investment Authority, the country’s sovereign
wealth fund, is Zain’s  largest shareholder  with 24.6 percent.  National Investments  rose  5.3 percent to 500 fils in Kuwait
trading today, the highest level in almost a year. Shares of the
company have soared 37 percent this year.  Zain shares  rose 1.5
percent to close at 1,360 fils.  Etisalat offers telecommunications services in 18 countries
in the Middle East, Africa and Asia to more than 100 million
customers, according to its website. The seven emirates of the
U.A.E. make up about 86 percent of Etisalat’s sales.  Zain had 34.2 million customers at the end of the first
half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
