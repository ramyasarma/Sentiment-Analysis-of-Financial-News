Allied Irish Banks Plc rose 1.1
percent in Dublin trading after the lender said it expects to
generate about 900 million euros ($1.26 billion) of capital from
the sale of its 22.4 percent stake in U.S. lender M&T Corp.  The Dublin-based lender said in the early hours of this
morning that the proceeds from the stake disposal will be about
$2 billion. Allied Irish priced the offering of 26.7 million
notes in M&T at $77.50 each, it said in a statement. The notes
will be exchanged for shares in the U.S. bank by Nov. 15,
subject to approval from Allied Irish shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting on Nov. 1, it added.  The stock rose 0.5 cent to 45 cents at 8:03 a.m. local
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
