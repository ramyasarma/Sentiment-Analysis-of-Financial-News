The New York Yankees erased a three-
run deficit in beating the Minnesota Twins 6-4 in the opening
game of their American League playoff series.   The Yankees scored four runs in the sixth inning and Mark
Teixeira hit a two-run home run in the seventh to snap a 4-4 tie
at Target Field in Minneapolis.   Game 2 in the best-of-five series is scheduled for tomorrow
in Minnesota, where the Yankees have won five straight
postseason games dating back to 2003.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
