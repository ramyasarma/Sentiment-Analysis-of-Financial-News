Alvarion Ltd.  soared the most in more
than 21 months after the maker of wireless telecommunications
systems signed an agreement valued at more than $75 million to
deploy a fourth-generation network across Canada.  The shares  surged  21 percent, the most since January 2009,
to 8.18 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, giving the
company a market value of 474.2 million shekels ($132 million).  Alvarion will supply Barrett Xplore Inc. with equipment and
services under the multiyear agreement, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
