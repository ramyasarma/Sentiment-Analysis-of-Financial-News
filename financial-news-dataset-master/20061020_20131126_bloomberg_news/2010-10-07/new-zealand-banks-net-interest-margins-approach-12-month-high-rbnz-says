New Zealand banks’ interest margins
grew in August to the widest level in at least a year, according
to statistics published for the first time by the central bank.  The net interest margin across all lenders rose to 2.11
percent from 2.09 percent in July to reach the highest since the
series began in September last year, according to figures
published on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  website  yesterday.  Bank margins are expanding from levels immediately before
the global financial crisis, when competition for loans squeezed
profit.  The net margin is calculated by dividing net interest
income by average interest-bearing assets. The figures come from
monthly surveys of banks, which provide timelier data than the
quarterly general disclosure statements that banks file, the
central bank said.  Margins at some banks can be volatile because of wholesale
market activity, the central bank said. The net interest margin
of a subset of eight retail banks that have significant loans to
and deposits from the household sector rose to 2.12 percent, the
central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
