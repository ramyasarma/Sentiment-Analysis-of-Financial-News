Renault SA ’s bonds surged after
France’s second-largest carmaker raised 3 billion euros ($4.2
billion) to pay down debt by selling a stake in Volvo AB.  Renault’s 6 percent notes due October 2014 rose 0.975, or
9.75 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,400) face amount, to a bid price
of 106.543 at 9:25 a.m. in London, Bloomberg composite prices
show. Credit-default swaps insuring the carmaker’s debt fell 21
basis points to 216, according to data provider CMA, the lowest
in almost six months.  Renault sold a 14.9 percent stake in  Volvo , taking
advantage of a 57 percent rise in the truckmaker’s shares over
the past 12 months amid strong earnings and an improved profit
outlook. The automaker pledged to cut its industrial debt, which
stood at 4.7 billion euros June 30, to 3 billion euros or less.  Renault’s long-term borrowings are  rated  Ba1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, the highest non-investment grade ranking, and
one step lower at BB at Standard & Poor’s.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to debt agreements. A basis point on a
contract protecting 10 million euros of debt from default for
five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
