Australia is likely to face demands
for more than A$2 billion in water rights buybacks from farmers
as part of the Murray-Darling river plan, the Sydney Morning
Herald reported today, citing Australian National University
Professor Quentin Grafton. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority is
expected to announce water extraction must reduce by 27 percent
to 37 percent, the newspaper said. Labor has said its A$9
billion recovery plan won’t secure enough water to meet
reduction targets, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
