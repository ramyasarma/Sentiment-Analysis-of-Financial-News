Wheat futures rose after a government
report showed exports are increasing from the U.S., the world’s
biggest producer.  U.S. exporters sold 808,447 metric tons in the week ended
Sept. 30, up 29 percent from a week earlier, the Department of
Agriculture said. Prices have jumped 37 percent since the end of
June after drought damaged crops in Russia. The  dollar  touched
the lowest level in eight months against a basket of major
currencies, enhancing the allure of U.S. goods.  “We have plenty of wheat in the U.S., but we have this
island of supply, and the rest of the world seems to be short,”
said  Jerod Leman , a broker at Wellington Commodities in Carmel,
Indiana. “We may get a pickup in exports.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 1 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $6.5925 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price headed for a weekly gain.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
