Credit Suisse Group AG  and  UBS AG  are
being drawn back to Turkey after more than a one-year absence as
companies take advantage of the lowest yields in at least six
years to reduce borrowing costs.  The biggest Swiss banks are among lenders that helped
arrange offerings this year for Turkey’s government as well as
companies, including Lider Faktoring Hizmetkeri AS. They’re
competing for clients against firms led by JPMorgan Chase & Co.
as issuance in Turkey almost doubled to $7.5 billion from a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Turkey’s growth dynamics and robust economy has captured
the interest of international investors,”  Gaurav Arora , a
London-based debt capital markets banker responsible for Turkey
with BNP Paribas SA, which has underwritten $763.6 million in
Turkey over the past decade. “We see this trend continuing with
more and more issuers accessing debt capital markets.”  The increase corresponds with an  economy  that expanded 10.3
percent in the second quarter, matching China as the fastest-
growing among the Group of 20 major economies. Investment in
Turkey is also climbing. So-called net portfolio holdings gained
$10.8 billion during the first seven months of 2010, compared
with withdrawals of $873 million a year earlier, according to
 current-account  figures published Sept. 15 by the central bank.  “Our economic policies are establishing trust among
foreign investors, markets abroad and consumers and that’s
helping to drive a speedy economic recovery,” said Deputy Prime
Minister  Ali Babacan , who heads Turkey’s economic team, after
second-quarter growth figures were published last month.  ‘Positive’  Moody’s Investors Service raised Turkey’s credit-rating
outlook on Oct. 5 to “positive” from “stable.” The
International Monetary Fund said the next day that it expects
economic growth this year of 7.8 percent, more than double the
pace of Europe’s other emerging markets.  Yields on  benchmark  two-year lira bonds fell 19 basis
points this week to 7.84 percent as of Oct. 6, the lowest level
since at least 2004. Investors demand an average yield of 4.22
percent from Turkish issuers for bonds sold in yen, pounds,
euros or dollars, down from 7.85 percent in 2008, according to
index data compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Zurich-based  Credit Suisse  has arranged $542.7 million of
bond offerings to rank eighth in Turkey this year, after
underwriting no deals in 2008 and 2009, according to Bloomberg
data. UBS, also based in Zurich, has underwritten $666.7 million
of debt so far in 2010 after a year away from the market.  Akbank, Yapi & Kredi  Turkish lenders Akbank TAS and Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS
issued Eurobonds for the first time this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, as borrowing costs declined. Yapi Kredi’s
$750 million of five-year notes rose on their first two days of
trading after being issued Oct. 4, with the yield falling 12
basis points yesterday to 4.77 percent.  JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by market value, has the
largest share of Turkish underwriting with total issuance of
$916.7 million this year, up from $800 million in 2009.
Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc increased the
amount of debt it covers to $333.3 million from $50 million last
year.  Bond issuance in Turkey so far in 2010 is 49 percent ahead
of the record pace set in 2006, when $7.9 billion of securities
were sold during the entire year, according to Bloomberg data.
The number of firms managing Turkish deals rose to 16 in 2010
from nine in 2009.  Underwriters  Turkey’s bond sales are a standout, doubling so far this
year from 2009.  That compares with a 4.3 percent gain for
overall bond sales in the emerging markets through Oct. 7,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Hungarian offerings
increased 5.1 percent and Czech Republic debt underwriting rose
5 percent to date.  The number of companies underwriting debt in Turkey fell to
eight in 2007 from 15 the prior year, when debt issuance was the
highest since Bloomberg started tracking the data in 1999. Debt
sales were at a seven-year low in 2009, following the 2008
bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  “Turkish corporates were heavy borrowers up until 2007 and
then the Lehman bankruptcy changed everything,” said  Inan Demir , chief economist at  Finansbank AS  in Istanbul. “Liquidity
just dried up, and suddenly they were neither willing nor able
to borrow in the same magnitude.”  Turkey’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged in September for a 10th consecutive month, saying it
expects to keep rates “at present levels for some time longer
and at low levels for a long time.” The lira strengthened 9.6
percent to 1.4456 against the dollar in the third quarter, the
biggest three-month appreciation since the end of 2004.  ‘Shot Up’  The cost of protecting Turkish debt against non-payment has
dropped 20 percent this year, with five-year credit default
swaps falling to 145.9 on Oct. 6 from 182.81 at the end of 2009,
according to data provider CMA. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a government or company fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  “Demand for Turkish debt has shot up,” said  Dmitri Gourov , a Vienna-based analyst at UniCredit SpA, which arranged
Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS’s $750 million debt issue. “Companies
need financing again, and they’re taking advantage of record-low
interest rates to tap the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
