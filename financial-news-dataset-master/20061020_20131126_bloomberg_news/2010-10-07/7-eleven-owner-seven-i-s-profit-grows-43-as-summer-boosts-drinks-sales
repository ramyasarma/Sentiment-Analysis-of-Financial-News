Seven & I Holdings Co. , owner of the
7-Eleven convenience-store brand, boosted first-half  profit  43
percent after its founding family donated 7 billion yen ($85
million) to the company and one-time charges fell.  Net income  rose to 62.43 billion yen in the six months
ended August from 43.69 billion yen a year earlier,  Seven & I 
said in a statement today.  The cash donated by the Ito family to Japan’s biggest
retailer will be used to build a training center, Nobuyuki
Miyaji, a company spokesman, said at a briefing in Tokyo today.
 Seven & I  also joins smaller rival Aeon Co. in reporting
earnings that were boosted by Japan’s hottest summer in more
than a century.  Seven & I  had one-time charges, including losses from asset
sales, of 12.7 billion yen in the first half, compared with 17.7
billion yen a year earlier, it said in the statement. The Tokyo-
based retailer is forecasting its first profit increase in four
years as it closes unprofitable stores and sells more of its own
brand of groceries and clothes.  Revenue  increased 0.5 percent to 2.56 trillion yen in the
first half. Japan’s hottest summer on record helped boost
profits at Seven & I’s convenience stores, Chief Operating
Officer  Noritoshi Murata  told reporters today in Tokyo. The
company’s Seven-Eleven Japan unit boosted operating profit 4
percent in the six-month period.  Full-Year Forecast  Aeon said yesterday increasing demand for drinks and
underwear due to the heat wave helped sales of products under
its Topvalu brand grow 1.2 percent in the first half.  Seven & I rose 3.9 percent to close at 2,051 yen in Tokyo
trading before the earnings announcement. The benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average dropped 0.1 percent.  The company reiterated its full-year profit forecast of 100
billion yen for the period ending February 2011, more than
double the net income earned last year, when it took a charge of
about 40 billion yen for costs including store closures and
asset writedowns at its department-store division.  Analysts  forecast  full-year profit of 102.2 billion yen and
sales of 5.14 trillion yen, according to the average of 13
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Seven & I, which generates 70 percent of revenue in Japan,
cut its full-year sales forecast 1.2 percent. Japan’s retail
sales climbed 4.3 percent in August, less than economists had
forecast, government data released Sept. 30 showed. Wages in
Japan also stagnated in August, failing to rise for the first
time in six months, the government said.  Casey’s Bid  The company’s U.S. convenience-store chain unit is in talks
to acquire Casey’s General Stores Inc., which has more than
1,500 outlets throughout the U.S. Midwest, Casey’s said Sept.
9. Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. said Sept. 30 it will drop its
$38.50-a-share bid for Casey’s after 7-Eleven offered $40 a
share.  The outcome of the talks may not be known for “a while,”
Murata told reporters today in Tokyo.  Seven & I opened its  first outlet  in Japan in 1974 and had
12,907 convenience stores in the nation as of Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
