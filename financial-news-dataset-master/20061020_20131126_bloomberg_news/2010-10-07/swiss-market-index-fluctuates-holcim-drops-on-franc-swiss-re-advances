Swiss stocks fluctuated. Holcim Ltd.
and Swatch Group AG fell after the franc extended an advance to
a record against the dollar, hurting earnings at companies with
overseas sales. Swiss Reinsurance Co. gained.  The benchmark  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most
actively traded companies gained less than 0.1 percent to
6,355.17 at 11:15 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has dropped 8.8
percent from this year’s high on April 15 as concern re-emerged
that a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe will crimp economic
growth and a U.S. recovery is faltering. The broader  Swiss
Performance Index  also added 0.1 percent today.  The Swiss franc strengthened against the dollar today,
appreciating as much as 0.6 percent to 95.55 centimes.
Switzerland, Japan South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil are among
countries that have intervened in markets to temper their
currencies against the dollar to stay competitive.  “The market is sensitive to assessing which companies will
fare better and which ones worse in this currency war that’s
shot up,” said Luis Benguerel, trader of international equities
at Interbrokers in Barcelona, Spain.  Holcim , the world’s second-biggest cement maker, fell 1.6
percent to 62.05 francs. The company makes most of its operating
income from Asia and Latin America. Swatch, the maker of Omega
watches, retreated 1.1 percent to 361.5 francs, the first
decline this week.  Swiss Re, the world’s second-largest reinsurer, rose 1.6
percent to 44.2 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
