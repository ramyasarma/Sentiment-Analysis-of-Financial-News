The Czech Republic’s trade surplus
was the narrowest in 20 months in August as the recovery from a
recession boosted demand for imported goods and raw materials.  The monthly surplus was 537 million koruna ($30.7 million),
the Prague-based statistics office said on its  website  today,
after a revised 5.5 billion surplus in July. The median estimate
of 11 economists in the Bloomberg survey was for a surplus of 5
billion koruna.  The Czech Republic is recovering from the worst recession
since the end of communism in 1989 after demand for its
products, such as cars made by Volkswagen’s Skoda Auto AS,
crumbled last year and pushed the public finance deficit to 5.8
percent of gross domestic product.  The Czech economy grew an annual 2.4 percent in the three
months through June, the fastest pace in eight quarters. The
Finance Ministry on July 15 raised its forecast for 2010 growth
to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent on expectations of improved
demand for exports, which make up about 70 percent of GDP.  Exports rose 23 percent on the year to 196.063 billion
koruna in August, with imports rising 30.1 percent to 195.526
billion koruna.  To contact the reporters on this story:
