German  bunds  fell as  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the European Central Bank is making policy for the
entire European Union and urged nations to cut their deficits,
signaling he won’t slow the exit from emergency stimulus.  Two-year yields rose from the lowest in a week as demand
for the safety of fixed income ebbed. The ECB president, who
held interest rates at a record low today that he called
“appropriate,” said the region’s economic recovery will be
“moderate.” He also said banks are asking for less ECB cash.  “Trichet is not overly dovish, as he was last time,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Banking in London. “Trichet also
suggested that the reduction in liquidity was progressive, and
the market can read that as a positive development in the
banking sector.”  The 10-year bund yield rose 5 basis points to 2.27 percent
at 4:02 p.m. in London, extending gains after Trichet began
speaking at a press conference in Frankfurt following the rate
decision. The 2.25 percent security due September 2020 fell
0.445, or 4.45 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,394) face amount, to
99.805. Two-year yields climbed 3 basis points to 0.81 percent.  The ECB kept its benchmark  rate  at a record low 1 percent,
as predicted by all 52 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Bank Cash  Near-record borrowing costs for nations across the euro
region’s periphery relative to Germany are making it harder for
the ECB to wean commercial banks off the lifeline of cheap cash
it introduced two years ago. The extra yield that investors
demand to hold Irish and Portuguese debt over Germany’s rose
last week to 454 basis points and 441 basis points respectively.  “As regards our full-allotment mode, which is a non-
standard measure, I would only say that in our understanding of
the overall assessment at the level of the euro area as a whole,
we consider that it’s still necessary,” Trichet said of the
emergency ECB cash. “The market is not functioning correctly,
at least until now. We consider it’s necessary to have this non-
standard way of committing the monetary policy transmission
channel to function as well as possible.”  Trichet said he’s responsible for price stability in 16
countries, and his decisions aren’t made with one country in
mind.  Economic Reports, Auctions  Earlier today, a report from the Economy Ministry showed
German  industrial production  expanded 1.7 percent in August from
a month earlier, more than the 0.5 percent forecast of 36
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Spain sold 3.2 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of 2.5 percent
2013 notes today, and France auctioned 8.5 billion euros of
2020, 2026 and 2029 securities.  Spanish government bonds rose  relative  to benchmark German
bunds today, narrowing the so-called yield spread to 176 basis
points from 178. The  Greek-German spread  narrowed 9 basis points
to 757 basis points, while the Portuguese spread widened 1 basis
point to 402 basis points. The Irish spread also added 1 basis
point, to 423 points.  Spain sold 3.2 billion euros of three-year notes at
auction, attracting bids worth 2.2 times more than the
securities sold, compared with 1.9 times the last time the debt
was sold, on Aug. 5. The Bank of Spain was looking to sell a
maximum of 4 billion euros of debt. The 2.5 percent notes were
sold at an average yield of 2.527 percent, versus 2.276 percent
at the previous auction.  France issued the maximum amount it indicated before the
auction, including 5.075 billion euros of 2.5 percent 2020
bonds, 2.29 billion euros of 3.5 percent 2026 notes and 1.125
billion euros of 5.5 percent 2029 debt.  U.S., U.K. Yields  The 2020 bond has the lowest coupon ever issued by France
on a 10-year security, the nation’s debt management agency,
Agence France Tresor, said in an e-mail following the sale.  The Portuguese economy may contract 1.4 percent next year
if new budget deficit-cutting measures are taken into account,
the International Monetary Fund said after European bond markets
closed yesterday. The IMF had forecast no growth in 2011 GDP
prior to the announcement of the additional measures last week.  U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were little changed at 2.4
percent today, while equivalent U.K. gilt yields were 3 basis
points higher at 2.93 percent after the Bank of England kept its
main rate at a record-low 0.5 percent and maintained its asset-
purchase target at 200 billion pounds ($320 billion).  German bonds have returned 2.3 percent since June 30,
compared with 3.2 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.8 percent
for U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
