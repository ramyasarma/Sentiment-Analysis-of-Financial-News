South Africa’s ruling African
National Congress is planning a moratorium on the sale of land
to foreigners to accelerate ownership reform,  Fin24.com 
reported, citing Annelise Crosby of the farmer group Agri SA.  The proposal will be discussed in addition to other changes
to the country’s land reform program, the news website said.  The ANC’s social transformation committee will meet on Oct.
9 to discuss the moratorium and an expropriation bill, the
website said. The ANC wants to scrap the principle of willing
seller as a basis for settling land claims, it said.  The department of rural development and land reform settled
less than 10 percent of more than 1,600 land claims in the past
fiscal year, Fin24 said, citing the ministry’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
