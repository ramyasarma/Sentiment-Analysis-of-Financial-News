Countries aren’t in a “currency
war,” as Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said last
month, panelists said during a Bloomberg currency conference in
New York.  Developing nations worldwide have been buying dollars and
taking other measures to stem their currencies’ rise. Brazil
doubled its foreign inflow tax on fixed-income investments to 4
percent on Oct. 4.  “It’s currently not a war,” said  Richard Clarida , global
strategist at Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Investment
Management Co., which runs the world’s biggest bond fund. “I
would distinguish between outright interventions and cases where
countries are essentially trying to slow the pace at which
fundamentals evolve. That’s how I interpret Brazil.”  The Brazilian government is trying to temper a four-month
rally in the real that has sent the currency 12 percent higher
since June 7. The real fell 0.1 percent to 1.6810 per dollar,
from 1.6788 yesterday.  Emerging markets “have always been trying to manage their
currencies,” said  Stephen Duneier , founder and portfolio
manager at Grant Capital Partners in Santa Barbara, California.
“This is the election season in Brazil, and the Brazilians feel
a lot of heat from exporters and they want to be seen as helping
them out, so naturally they’re going to be tough about it right
now. But that’s a very short-term phenomenon.”  Rhetoric could become a “currency war” if the economic
slump deepens, said  Alessio de Longis , portfolio manager at
OppenheimerFunds Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
