Harmony Gold Mining Ltd., Africa’s
third-largest producer of the metal, fell to the lowest level in
more than a month after saying quarterly output may drop 3
percent because of shaft closures.  The temporary stoppage of operations at its Joel North
shaft, the shutdown of its Phakisa mine for 13 days after an
accident and the planned closure of two shafts reduced output in
the three months through September, the company said in a
statement today.  Shares  in Harmony retreated 3.09 rand, or 3.8 percent, to
77.50 rand at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, the lowest level
since Sept. 3 and cutting the company’s value to 33.2 billion
rand ($4.8 billion).  Harmony is among African gold miners grappling with rising
electricity prices and above-inflation increases in labor costs
as it digs deeper to extract shrinking reserves. South Africa
has the world’s deepest and most dangerous mines, where workers
operate as far as 2.35 miles underground.  Electricity costs during the quarter rose by 140 million
rand from the previous three months, while labor costs increased
by about 50 million rand, Harmony said.  The company is shutting unprofitable operations and
focusing on “longer-life, lower-cost operations,” Chief
Executive Officer  Graham Briggs  said in the statement.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and  Gold Fields Ltd.  are Africa’s
largest gold producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
