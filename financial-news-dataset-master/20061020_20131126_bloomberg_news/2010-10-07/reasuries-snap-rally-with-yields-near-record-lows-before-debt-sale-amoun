U.S. two-year Treasury yields matched
a record low amid speculation the Federal Reserve will resume
asset purchases under its quantitative-easing plan, aiming to
boost growth as jobs data points to a slowing economic recovery.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed near the
lowest since January 2009 before reports today and tomorrow that
economists estimate will show initial claims for jobless
insurance increased and the unemployment rate rose. The bonds
were little changed before the U.S. says today how much it will
raise in sales of three-, 10- and 30-year debt next week.  “We’re switching to wait-and-see mode before the jobs
reports,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income analyst at
WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, Germany. “So much QE has already been
priced into the market, so there is a belief that there’s the
potential for a payback” should the data fail to meet analyst
estimates, he said.  Benchmark 10-year note rates were little changed at 2.39
percent at 8:35 a.m. in London, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The 2.625 percent security maturing in August 2020 rose
1/32, or $0.31 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 22/32.  The two-year yield was at 0.379 percent and reached a
record-low 0.375 percent for a second day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
