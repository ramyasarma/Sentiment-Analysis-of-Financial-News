The Italian government’s efforts to
give local authorities more control over tax policy will improve
the public finances, Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti said today
at a press conference in Rome.  Under the current plan, local governments will be able to
keep part of value-added taxes levied in their regions and
control part of other tax collection to finance local services
including health care. Tremonti says implemening the devolution
plan will not change total tax revenue.  Once its in place, the government will then go ahead with
plans to overhaul the country’s tax system, he said today at a
press conference in Rome.  To contact the reporter on this story:
