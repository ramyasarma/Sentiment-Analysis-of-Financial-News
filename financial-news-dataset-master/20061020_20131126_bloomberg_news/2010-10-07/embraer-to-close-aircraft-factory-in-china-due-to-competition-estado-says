Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA 
will close an aircraft factory in China, Brazil’s Estado news
agency reported, citing the company’s executive vice president
of commercial aviation.  “The Chinese are going to start their own production in
2011 and they see us as competitors,” Embraer’s  Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva  told Estado.  Embraer expects the aviation market to return to pre-
financial crisis levels from the end of next year, Silva said.
Silva also forecast sales of 90 to 95 aircraft this year, Estado
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
