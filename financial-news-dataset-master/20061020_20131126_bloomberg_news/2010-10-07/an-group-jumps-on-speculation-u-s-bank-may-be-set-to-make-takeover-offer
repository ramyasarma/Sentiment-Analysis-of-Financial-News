Man Group Plc , the hedge-fund manager
that’s buying GLG Partners Inc., rose the most in five weeks
amid speculation that an unidentified U.S. bank may make an
offer for the firm.  Man Group  jumped  5.1 percent to 249.8 pence at the close of
trading in London. The shares have risen 16 percent this week.
 George Trefgarne , a spokesman for London-based Man Group,
declined to comment.  “There is vague talk a U.S. bank may be interested in
bidding for them,” said  Manoj Ladwa , a London-based senior
trader at ETX Capital. “The stock has been performing very well
over the last few days and it is backed up by volumes.”  The world’s largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager
agreed in May to buy New York-based GLG for $1.6 billion to
widen its range of funds. The firm said the acquisition would
create a company with about $63 billion in assets, easing its
dependence on Man AHL Diversified Plc, an investment program
that accounts for more than half of Man’s holdings.  AHL is about 7 percent from so-called watermark level, when
Man Group starts receiving performance fees, Man Group Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Clarke  said in September. AHL
Diversified’s daily reported fund is up 4 percent this month,
Bank of America Corp. analyst  Philip Middleton  said in a note to
clients today.  The program “seems to be having a purple patch,”
Middleton wrote. “This would leave the strategy close to
performance fee territory and even, in all likelihood, actually
generating fees on some products.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
