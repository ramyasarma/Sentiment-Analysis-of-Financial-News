Gold, which rose to a record this
week, may extend its advance on demand for an alternative to
currencies, a survey found.  Twelve of 18 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 67 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Five forecast lower prices and one was neutral. Gold for
December delivery rose to a record $1,366 an ounce yesterday by
12:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  The dollar yesterday slid to the lowest level against the
yen in 15 years and dropped to an eight-month low against the
euro on speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy more to bolster U.S. growth. The Bank of Japan lowered
its main interest rate to “virtually zero” this week.  “As long as central banks are willing to be led by the Fed
down a never-ending pathway of debasement, gold will continue
to rise,” said  Peter Schiff , the president of brokerage Euro
Pacific Capital in Darien, Connecticut.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling that most respondents expect a
decline. The green line shows the gold price. The data shown are
as of Oct. 1.  The weekly gold survey that started six years ago has
forecast prices accurately in 191 of 331 weeks, or 58 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 12  Bearish : 5  Neutral : 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
