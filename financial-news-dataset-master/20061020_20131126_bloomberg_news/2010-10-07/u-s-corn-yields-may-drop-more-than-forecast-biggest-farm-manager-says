(Corrects corn price measurement in the ninth paragraph.)  U.S. corn yields may fall 5 percent
this year, more than analysts forecast, because of adverse
weather, according to Farmers National Co., the largest manager
of crop land.  Yields may drop to 156.6 bushel an acre, said Jerry Warner,
the chief management officer at Farmers National who helps
oversee 2.5 million acres. That’s down from a record 164.7
bushels last year, and lower than the Department of
Agriculture’s September forecast of 162.5 bushels. The USDA is
scheduled to update its outlook tomorrow. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expect the agency to cut its estimate to 160.2
bushels.  “National corn yields may be down 5 percent based on
harvest results we are seeing” from fields across the Midwest,
Warner said from Omaha, Nebraska. “It’s a significant drop,
because there a lot of yields dropping more than 10 percent,”
including in Iowa and Illinois, the two biggest producing
states, he said.  Before today, corn futures surged 38 percent since June 1
on signs of a smaller crop. On Sept. 30, the USDA said
inventories were 322 million bushels higher than estimated
earlier that month. The next day, prices plunged 6.1 percent,
the most since January.  If yields drop more than forecast, prices may rebound on
renewed supply concerns, said Loyd Brown, the president of  Hertz
Farm Management Inc .  A national yield of 156.5 bushels would produce 12.677
billion bushels of corn this year. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg expect output to fall to 12.977 billion, after a crop
of 13.11 billion in 2009.  Yields Down 25%  Some yields may be down more than 25 percent from a year
earlier, Brown said from Nevada, Iowa. He expects the USDA to
cut the average to 160 bushels after surveying some of the
500,000 acres his company manages for landowners in eight U.S.
Midwest states.  “There is extremely wide variability in yields this
year,” Brown said. “A yield less than 160 bushels means prices
will stay above $5 a bushel” until next June to encourage
farmers to slow consumption and encourage farmers to plant more,
he said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 12.25 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $5.0075 a bushel at 12:59 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade yesterday. The price touched a two-year high of $5.2875
on Sept. 27.  Wet weather in June and July stunted or destroyed root
development, leading to increased numbers of plants to abort
kernels in the Midwest this year, said  Emerson Nafziger , an
agronomist at the University of Illinois in Champaign.  Yields also may fall 10 percent in some fields because
crops dried too quickly this year, causing kernels to shatter or
fall on the ground, Nafziger said.  ‘Goose Food’  “I don’t know of any corn yields in Illinois that are
better than last year and some are significantly worse,”
Nafziger said. “A lot of this year’s crop will end up as goose
food out in the field.”  Average Midwest rainfall in June was the most since 1990,
according to  Mike Tannura , the president of T-Storm Weather LLC
in Chicago. Parts of Iowa received  record rainfall  in June, and
 July  was the fifth wettest on record for the month, according to
the State Climatology Bureau.  Corn yields in 1990, 1998, 2000 and 2008 fell 1.3 percent
to 2.4 percent below the trend-yield average after heavy rains
in June, Tannura said in a report. That would project national
average yields between 154 bushels to 155.7 bushels, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
