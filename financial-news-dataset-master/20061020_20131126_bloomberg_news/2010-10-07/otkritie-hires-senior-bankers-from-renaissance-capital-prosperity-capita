Otkritie Financial Corp., partly
owned by Russia’s state-run VTB Group, hired five bankers from
Renaissance Capital, the Moscow-based investment group half-
owned by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov .  Otkritie said it hired  Tom Mundy ,  Berthold Maier , Richard
Beston,  Vinay Ruparelia  and  Sunil Joshi  from its competitor,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Mundy, an equity strategist at Renaissance for four years,
has been hired as chief equity strategist. Joshi, Maier and
Ruparelia join for sales roles in London. Betson, a sales trader
at Renaissance, has been hired for a similar role.  Otkritie also said it recruited Pavel Averkiev as vice-
president of equity sales. He previously worked as a director of
marketing at Prosperity Capital and Wermuth Asset Management.  The brokerage last week hired two domestic sales bankers
from RenCap after firing four of its Moscow sales team for
“lack of performance.”  Otkritie plans to recruit 90 bankers this year, taking the
total to 400, Chief Executive Officer Roman Lokhov said in a
July interview. The company aims to raise as much as $375
million in an initial public offering at the start of 2012 to
fund expansion and acquisitions, he said.  VTB, Russia’s second biggest lender, acquired a 19.9
percent stake in Otkritie as part of “a strategic alliance,”
according to a statement by Russia’s second-largest bank in
March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
