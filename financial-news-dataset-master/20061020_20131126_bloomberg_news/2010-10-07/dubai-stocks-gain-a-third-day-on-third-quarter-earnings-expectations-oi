Dubai shares rose to the highest
level in five months, leading gains in the Gulf, on investor
speculation third-quarter earnings in the United Arab Emirates
will beat expectations and as oil advanced.  Emaar Properties PJSC , the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, increased 1.1 percent.  Emirates NBD PJSC,  the
U.A.E.’s biggest bank by assets, gained the most in almost a
month.  Qatar National Bank SAQ  rose to the highest in more than
two years after third-quarter profit jumped 37 percent. The  DFM
General Index  advanced 1 percent to 1,722.55, the highest since
May 10, at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The index gained 2.3
percent this week. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of Gulf stocks
rose 0.4 percent.  “There are hopes that third-quarter results will be better
than expected for selected names,” said  Mohammed Ali Yasin ,
chief investment officer at CAPM Investments in Abu Dhabi.
“Volumes are low as investors are in the wait-and-see mode.”  Companies in the U.A.E. will start announcing third-quarter
results this month.  Qatar National Bank , the Persian Gulf
country’s biggest lender by assets, yesterday said quarterly
profit jumped to 1.45 billion riyals ($398 million).  Jarir
Marketing Co.,  Saudi Arabia’s largest stationery and book seller
by market value, said third-quarter net income rose 12 percent.  About 152 million shares traded in Dubai today, compared
with this year’s daily average of 159.6 million.  Oil for November delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to
$83.95 a barrel. Crude closed at $83.23 yesterday, the highest
settlement since May 3. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Gulf Stocks  Emaar, which has the heaviest weighting in Dubai’s index,
increased to 3.83 dirhams. Emirates NBD advanced 3.5 percent,
the most since Sept. 13, to 2.95 dirhams.  Qatar’s  QE Index  gained 0.2 percent and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX
General Index  increased 0.3 percent. Kuwait’s  gauge  rose 0.6
percent and  Bahrain’s  measure climbed 0.5 percent, while Oman’s
 MSM30 Index  was little changed. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed
for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
