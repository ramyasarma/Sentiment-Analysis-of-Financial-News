Michael Hill International Ltd. , New
Zealand’s biggest specialty jeweler, said first-quarter sales
rose 12.8 percent amid a recovery in consumer demand from the
year earlier.  Sales increased to NZ$95.4 million ($72 million) in the
three months ended Sept. 30 from the year earlier, the Brisbane-
based company said in a statement. Australian store sales
increased 11 percent and New Zealand sales rose 19 percent.  “The corresponding quarter in 2009 was still feeling the
effects of the global financial crisis however the company is
still very satisfied with the gains made in all markets,” the
company said. The second quarter is “the most critical trading
period for the group” and will largely determine the full-year
result, it said.  Sales across all U.S. stores fell 21.5 percent after the
company closed eight of its 17 outlets in June to reduce losses,
the company said. Sales in the remaining nine stores increased
26.5 percent.  Michael Hill  shares  rose 3 cents, or 4.4 percent, to 71 New
Zealand cents at the 5 p.m. close in Wellington, the biggest
gain in six weeks.  To contact the reporter for this story:
