Gerdau SA  and  Usinas Siderurgicas de
Minas Gerais SA , Brazil’s biggest steelmakers, were cut to
“hold” from “buy” at Deutsche Bank AG, which cited lower
domestic prices and competition from imported steel that may
affect the companies’ earnings.  The downgrades are based on the “strong price discounts
that are currently offered in order to fight the very high level
of steel imports” in Brazil,  Rodrigo Barros , an analyst at
Deutsche Bank in Sao Paulo, wrote in a report published
yesterday. “In the particular case of flat steel, imports
reached 28 percent of the apparent steel consumption in
August,” he wrote.  Deutsche Bank also chose  Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA  as
its “top pick” recommendation in the Brazilian steel industry,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
