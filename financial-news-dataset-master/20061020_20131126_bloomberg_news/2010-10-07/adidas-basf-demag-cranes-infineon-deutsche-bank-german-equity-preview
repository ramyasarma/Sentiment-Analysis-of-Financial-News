German stocks gained, as a slide in
 BASF SE  was offset by a rise in  Infineon Technologies AG  after
applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell

the U.S. Chipmaker Infineon rose 1.5 percent after Morgan
Stanley recommended the shares in new coverage. Demag Cranes AG
jumped 6.2 percent after the Financial Times Deutschland
reported that Finland’s  Konecranes Oyj  may make an offer for the
company.  The  DAX Index  gained 0.1 percent to 6,276.25 at the close
in Frankfurt, after swinging between gains and losses at least
12 times. The measure rallied 4.4 percent in the third quarter
as investors speculated that the U.S. Federal Reserve and other
central banks will provide more stimulus for the ailing global
recovery. The broader HDAX Index added less than 0.1 percent
today.  Jobless claims in the world’s largest economy dropped by
11,000 to 445,000 in the week ended Oct. 2, the fewest since
July 10, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
Economists projected 455,000 new claims last week, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The total number
of people receiving unemployment insurance decreased and those
getting extended payments jumped.  German Economy  Industrial production in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
increased at more than three times the pace that economists
forecast in August, led by demand for investment goods such as
machinery.  Production jumped 1.7 percent from July, when it rose 0.1
percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists
had forecast a gain of 0.5 percent, the median of 36 estimates
in a  Bloomberg News survey  showed. From a year earlier,
production increased 10.7 percent when adjusted for the number
of work days.  Infineon  climbed 1.5 percent to 5.16 euros, erasing
yesterday’s 1.2 percent slide. The chipmaker was rated at
“overweight” at Morgan Stanley.  Demag, the world’s largest maker of harbor cranes, jumped
6.2 percent to 31.49 euros, its highest price since September
2008. Konecranes may make an offer for Demag, the Financial
Times Deutschland reported, without saying where it got the
information. Konecranes declined to comment.  BASF, ThyssenKrupp  BASF , the world’s biggest chemical company, declined 1.5
percent to 47.77 euros, paring two days of gains. The chemical
company reported a spill in a process unit at its chemical plant
in Port Arthur, Texas, according to a message left on a
community hotline.  Steelmaker  ThyssenKrupp AG  advanced 1.8 percent to 25.38
euros, the highest price since April. Societe Generale SA

euros.  HeidelbergerCement AG, the world’s third-largest cement
maker, tumbled 4.7 percent to 35.40 euros, the biggest fall
since Aug. 24.  “The market is a bit nervous about negative pricing in the
U.S.,”  Tim Cahill , an analyst at Davy Stockbrokers, said in an
interview. “Industry discipline is being tested by very low
utilization rates.”   Kloeckner & Co. SE , the German metals trader, slipped 1.7
percent to 16.09 euros, falling for a second day. The company
