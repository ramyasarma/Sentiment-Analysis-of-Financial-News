Italian banks should find it cheaper
to adjust to Basel III rules because they’re less “leveraged,”
Bank of Italy Deputy General Director Anna Maria Tarantola said
during a Parliament hearing today, according to the text of the
speech distributed by e-mail today.  Even if Italian banks on average have less capital than
international rivals, the adjustment will be less onerous and
corporate lending shouldn’t be too affected, Tarantola said.
Banks should keep adding so-called liquid assets, she added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
