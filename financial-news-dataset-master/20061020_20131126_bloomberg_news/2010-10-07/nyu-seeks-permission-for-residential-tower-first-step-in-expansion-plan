New York University is seeking
permission from the city to build a residential tower on
property with landmark status, the institution’s first step in
gaining approval for an expansion that could increase its campus
by 40 percent.  NYU, the largest private, nonprofit university by
enrollment in the U.S., filed an application today with the  New
York City Landmarks Preservation Commission , the university said
in an e-mail. NYU wants to build a 37-story tower in a
landmarked zone that includes three buildings designed by  I.M. Pei  in 1966, a change from earlier plans that would have built
the tower just outside the protected area.  The tower, which would be used to house either faculty or
students, would sit on property between Bleecker and Houston
streets. It’s part of a  plan  to add as much as 6 million square
feet to NYU by 2031 around the university’s Greenwich Village
campus as well as on Manhattan’s East Side, Brooklyn and
Governors Island. Neighborhood preservations oppose the growth
in the village, which makes up about a half of the expansion
plan, fearing a loss of the district’s historical character. NYU
said it will file plans with the city for the overall project in
2011 and a decision regarding the location of the fourth tower
will influence that plan.  NYU, founded in 1831, has about 51,000 students. Graduates
include former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  and
 Rudolph Giuliani , the former mayor of New York City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
