Investec Asset Management, the wealth
management unit of  Investec Plc  that oversees about $70 billion,
has grown its emerging-market debt fund eightfold in six months
as investors boosted purchases of higher-yielding assets.  The wealth manager, based in Cape Town and London, has
boosted the size of the fund to $4 billion from $500 million,
 John Green , director of global business development at Investec
Asset Management, said in a presentation in Johannesburg today.  “Emerging-market debt is becoming an accepted mainstream
asset class,” said Green. “It’s not hot money -- it’s much
more sustainable than what we’ve seen before.”  Emerging-market bonds have rallied this year as near-zero
interest rates in major economies and slowing economic growth
encourage investors to borrow cheaply and invest the proceeds in
markets offering higher returns. Developing-nation debt has
attracted a total $39.5 billion in investments this year,
according to Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global.  “We believe there has been a fundamental switch from low-
yielding Western markets to high-yielding emerging markets,”
 Jeremy Gardiner , a director at Investec Asset Management, said
at the same event.  The company expects to increase the size of its emerging-
market bond fund to $6 billion by year-end, according to Green.  To contact the reporters on this story:
