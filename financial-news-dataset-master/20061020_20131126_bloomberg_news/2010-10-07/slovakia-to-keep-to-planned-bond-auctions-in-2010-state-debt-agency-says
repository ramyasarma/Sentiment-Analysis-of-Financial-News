Slovakia will hold all four domestic
bond auctions scheduled for the rest of the year, even as it
raised more funds than planned at yesterday’s sale of 15-year
debt, the State Debt Agency chief  Daniel Bytcanek  said.  The east European country that adopted the euro in 2009
plans to raise about 800 million euros ($1.12 billion) more in
bond sales by December, with the exact amount dependent on the
budget gap, Bytcanek said. The agency, known as Ardal, probably
won’t hold any Treasury-bill auctions for at least two months,
he said.  “We aren’t changing the schedule and we will continue with
the planned auctions,” Bytcanek said in a phone interview today
from the Slovak capital Bratislava. “Money raised through the
15-year bond will be used to cover the budget deficit and as
pre-funding for the repayment of bills maturing in January.”  Slovakia yesterday raised 2 billion euros in 15-year bonds,
double the original target, at a lower cost than higher-rated
euro-region  member  Spain. The bonds were sold at 150 basis
points above the mid-swap rate, a sign Finance Minister  Ivan Miklos  said shows investors consider plans to cut the budget
shortfall as credible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
