ArcelorMittal SA had an antitrust
fine cut by more than 46 million euros ($64.3 million) after the
 European Commission  said it corrected a mistake in the way it
penalized companies for a cartel in pre-stressing steel.  The commission said it cut fines to 458 million euros, down
from 518.5 million euros, because of an unidentified error.
ArcelorMittal’s fine, the largest individual fine, was cut to
230.4 million euros down from 276.5 million euros. The company
said in June that total fines for its units were 315 million
euros.  Regulators fined 17 steel producers on June 30 for fixing
the prices of steel used to reinforce concrete for 18 years,
until 2002. EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said it
was “amazing” how so many companies had “abused nearly the
entire European construction market” for so long.  The antitrust unit of the commission  said  on its website
that it “corrected errors in the calculation of the fines.”
 Amelia Torres , a spokeswoman for the EU executive, declined to
comment today beyond the statement.  A fine on Finland’s Rautaruukki Oyj was reduced to
4.3 million euros from 4.7 million. Fines on former Spanish
ArcelorMittal units Galycas and Emesa, sold in 2004, and its
current Spanish unit were reduced to 36.7 million euros from
40.8 million euros.  Spokespeople for ArcelorMittal in Luxembourg and London
didn’t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
