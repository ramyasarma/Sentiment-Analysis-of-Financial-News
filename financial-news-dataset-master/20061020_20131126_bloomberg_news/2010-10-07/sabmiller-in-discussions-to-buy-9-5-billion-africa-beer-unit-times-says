SABMiller Plc is in discussions to
acquire one of Africa’s biggest brewers from Groupe Castel in a
deal worth more than 6 billion pounds ($9.5 billion), the
London-based Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The family-controlled French liquor company owns the
Nicolas chain of wine merchants and several major Bordeaux
vineyards and beer operations in 20 French-speaking African
nations, the newspaper said.  Neither SABMiller nor Castel would comment, the Times said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
