The Carlyle Group, the world’s
second-largest private-equity firm, plans to hold an initial
public offering of luxury sportswear maker  Moncler  in the second
quarter of 2011 after opening new stores and securing winter
orders, according to two people familiar with the plans.  Bank of America Corp., Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Morgan
Stanley will manage the IPO, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the preparations are private. Carlyle may
sell about half of its 48 percent stake in the Milan-based
company, which may also offer new stock, one person said.  Carlyle, which has committed to deals with a total value of
$123.8 billion since 2005, is seeking to sell businesses after
the financial crisis wiped out demand for new stock. After
buying the Moncler stake in 2008, it’s helped the company add
more than 30 stores, while sales grew 19 percent to 372 million
euros ($518 million) in 2009 as it started new collections.  “There’s no rush” to list and a date hasn’t been set,
Chairman Remo Ruffini, who owns 38 percent of Moncler, said
during the company’s show in Paris on Oct. 5.  Moncler, known for its down ski jackets that retail for
$1,000, may buy a brand with revenue between 50 million and 100
million euros, a purchase that could delay an IPO to allow for
the companies to combine, the person said. Moncler is in talks
with at least two targets, the person said.  Founded in 1952 in Monastier de Clermont, France, the
company owns the Marina Yachting and Henry Cotton’s labels.
Moncler had 2009 earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation of 79.4 million euros, compared with 54.7 million
in 2008.  An IPO in May or June would allow Moncler to present full-
year 2010 earnings and provide an outlook for the rest of 2011,
based on orders for its winter collection, the people said.  The share sale might coincide with the IPO of Prada SpA,
the Italian owner of the eponymous fashion label, which is
studying an offering in the first half of 2011, people familiar
with the plans said on Oct. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
