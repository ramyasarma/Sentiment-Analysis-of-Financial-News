Almost two-thirds of New Zealanders
say farms shouldn’t be sold to foreigners, the New Zealand
Herald reported, citing a poll.  The  survey  found 65 percent of 1,000 respondents said
farmers should only sell to New Zealand residents and 52 percent
wouldn’t support foreign investment even if the purchase
tripled the nation’s exports, the newspaper said.  The survey by Curia Market Research was commissioned by
Hong Kong-based  Natural Dairy (NZ) Holdings Ltd. , which is
awaiting  Overseas Investment Office  approval to buy as many as
16 farms on New Zealand’s North Island, the Herald said.  Forty one percent of respondents said they were “extremely
uncomfortable” with the sale of farms to Chinese owners, the
highest reading from five options which included Australian,
French, U.S. and British buyers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
