Sugar futures had the biggest gain in
almost two years on concern that supplies will be disrupted in
India, the world’s second-biggest producer. Cocoa and coffee
declined.  Sugar-cane growers in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s
largest grower, will withhold supplies should mills fail to meet
a minimum price requirement, a farm group said. Futures soared
46 percent in the third quarter after adverse weather damaged
crops in Russia and Pakistan.  “Production disruptions in India will support higher
prices,” said  Ricardo Scaff , a trader at Rabobank International
in New York.  Raw sugar for March delivery advanced 1.62 cents, or 6.9
percent, to settle at 25.16 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest gain since Oct. 29, 2008.
Earlier, the price reached 25.41 cents, the highest level for a
most-active contract since Feb. 22.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
gained $24.20, or 3.9 percent, to close at $649.80 a metric ton,
the highest settlement since Feb. 26.  Brazil is the largest producer.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 2.1
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $1.7345 a pound in New York. In
London, robusta-coffee futures for November delivery dropped $6,
or 0.4 percent, to $1,621 a ton.  Cocoa futures for December delivery declined $4, or 0.2
percent, to $2,740 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures
for December delivery fell 8 pounds, or 0.4 percent, to 1,840
pounds ($2,919).  To contact the reporter on this story:
