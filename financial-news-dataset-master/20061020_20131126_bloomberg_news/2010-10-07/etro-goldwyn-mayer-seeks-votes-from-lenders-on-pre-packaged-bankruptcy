Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. said it has
begun a solicitation of votes from its secured lenders for a
pre-packaged plan of reorganization.  The plan allows MGM’s secured lenders to exchange more than
$4 billion in outstanding debt for about 95.3 percent of equity
in MGM upon its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
