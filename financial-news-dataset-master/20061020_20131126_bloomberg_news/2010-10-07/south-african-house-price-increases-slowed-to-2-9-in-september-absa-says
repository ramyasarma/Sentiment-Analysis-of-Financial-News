South African average house price
growth for small, medium and large homes slowed to an annual 2.9
percent in September, Absa Group Ltd. Property Analyst Jacques
du Toit said in an e-mailed research note today.  House price growth slowed from a revised 5.4 percent in
August, according to the note. That reduced the average price of
a South African home to 1.012 million rand in September, the
research note said.  The data is compiled from the mortgages extended by Absa,
the note added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
