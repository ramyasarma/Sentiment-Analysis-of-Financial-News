Aeon Co. , Japan’s second-largest
retailer, rose the most in nine months in Tokyo trading after
boosting its full-year profit forecast because of lower
purchasing and other costs.  The stock climbed 6 percent to 976 yen at the 3 p.m. close
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the biggest gain since Jan. 8.  Net
income  may climb to between 49 billion yen ($590 million) and 55
billion yen in the 12 months ending February, compared with its
previous estimate of as much as 38 billion yen, the company said
yesterday after markets closed.  Aeon  is cutting distribution and purchasing costs while
forecasting sales will be little changed this fiscal year. The
operator of the Jusco supermarket chain has increased the number
of products under its own Topvalu label, which generates higher
 profit margins  than national brands.  “Cost-reduction efforts are panning out for Aeon,”  Mitsuo Shimizu , a Tokyo-based analyst at Cosmo Securities Co. , said in
Tokyo. “The company is also luring customers by improving the
quality of its private brand.”  The company, based in Chiba city near Tokyo, reduced
selling, general and administrative expenses at its general
merchandize store division by 31 billion yen in the first half,
beating its annual target of 30 billion yen, the company said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
