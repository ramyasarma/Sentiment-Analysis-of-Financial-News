Tullow Oil Plc  and partners may
double production at the Jubilee field off Ghana by 2015, the
head of country’s state-owned oil company said.  The field will start production this year and may pump
240,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2014-2015,  Nana Boakye Asafu-Adjaye , chief executive officer of Ghana National
Petroleum Corp., said today in Moscow.  Tullow, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Kosmos Energy LLC and
Ghana National, or GNPC, are investing about $3.35 billion to
develop the field. The first phase is expected to pump 120,000
barrels of oil a day in the first half of next year.  The partners are designing  Phases 1a and 1b  that together
with Phase 1 will target 500 million to 700 million barrels in
estimated oil reserves, Tullow Chief Financial Officer  Ian Springett  said yesterday.  Asafu-Adjaye said Ghana’s overall output by 2015 may be
larger than that as other companies including OAO Lukoil,
Russia’s largest non-state oil producer, move through the
appraisal phase on exploration drilling.  Lukoil, Vanco Energy Co. and GNPC found gas and oil in a
well completed this February at the Dzata structure off Ghana.  “We’re practically sure that it will be a commercial
discovery,” Dmitry Timoshenko, a vice president at Lukoil, told
journalists in Moscow today.  The Lukoil-led group said on Oct. 5 it plans to invest $200
million next year and in 2012 on exploring and proving
resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
