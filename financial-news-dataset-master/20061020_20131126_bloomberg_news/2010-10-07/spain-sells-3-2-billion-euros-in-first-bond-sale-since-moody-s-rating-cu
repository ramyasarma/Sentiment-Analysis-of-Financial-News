Spain sold 3.22 billion euros ($4.47
billion) of three-year debt in the first bond auction since
Moody’s Investors Service stripped the nation of its top Aaa
credit rating. Bonds rose after the sale.  The government sold the notes due 2013 at an average yield
of 2.527 percent, the Treasury in Madrid said today, compared
with 2.276 percent at a sale on Aug. 5, and a secondary market
rate of 2.604 before the sale. Demand was 2.15 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.89 times in August. The Treasury aimed to
sell a maximum of 4 billion euros.  Moody’s cut its rating for Spain to Aa1 from Aaa on Sept.
30, citing a weak economic outlook. Still, the company assigned
a stable outlook and said the government would probably achieve
its goal of cutting the budget deficit in half by next year.
Spain’s 10-year  borrowing costs  have fallen to 4 percent from
almost 5 percent in June, when Greece’s debt crisis was
spreading through southern Europe.  “Demand was decent,” said  Harvinder Sian , a senior bond
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in London. “It looks
like we’re in some kind of pocket of stability.”  Three-year notes yielded 2.569 percent at 10:59 a.m. in
Madrid, compared with 2.604 percent before the sale, while the
extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year bonds
rather than German equivalents narrowed to 175.5 basis points,
from 177.6 basis points yesterday.  Before today’s sale, Spain had about a quarter of its 2010
gross debt issuance to complete, according to data from the
 Treasury . Net debt issuance will amount to 43.3 billion euros
next year, compared with a planned 76.1 billion euros in 2010,
according to the 2011 budget that is making its way through
Parliament for approval by the end of the year.  Last quarter was the best for Spanish bonds since before
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in September 2008 as
investors backed government steps to lower public workers’
wages, freeze pensions and raise taxes to trim a deficit that
reached 11.1 percent of gross domestic product last year.
Spanish bonds returned 4.1 percent in the third quarter, after
the government cut public workers wages 5 percent, set a deficit
target of 6 percent of gross domestic product for 2011, and
raised value-added tax to 18 percent from 16 percent.  Spain lost its top grade at Fitch Ratings in May and at
Standard & Poor’s in January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
