Crop failures such as this year in
Russia are likely to become more common as climate change causes
more extreme weather with heat and drought stress, according to
a study led by the U.K.’s University of Leeds.  A simulation of climate change’s effect on spring wheat in
northeast China showed that in the worst case, more than 35
percent of crops may fail through 2099, compared with a baseline
rate of about 13 percent, the  study  showed.  “More extreme weather events are expected to occur in the
coming years due to climate change, and we have shown that these
events are likely to lead to more crop failures,” Andy
Challinor of the university’s School of Earth and Environment,
the study’s lead author, said in a  statement .  Adaptation to climate change may be possible with new crops
that better tolerate heat and water stress, as well as
modernization of farming and improvement of social and economic
conditions, the study shows.  “The development of stress-tolerant crop does not
naturally lead to its availability to the farmers who need it,”
the authors said in the study. “Previous studies in northeast
China have shown that the vulnerability of wheat yields to
drought is correlated with data representing access to capital
and land.”  Using median values in their climate-change simulation, the
researchers found the percentage of crops failing, defined as
yields lower than one standard deviation below the average over
the 1990 to 2099 period, would range from about 20 percent to 30
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
