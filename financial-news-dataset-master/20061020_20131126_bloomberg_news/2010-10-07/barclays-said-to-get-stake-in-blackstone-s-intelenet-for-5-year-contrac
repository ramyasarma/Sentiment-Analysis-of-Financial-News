Barclays Plc , Britain’s third-biggest
bank, plans to take a stake valued at about $120 million in
an Indian company providing back-office services that’s partly 
owned by Blackstone Group LP, according to a person with 
knowledge of the matter.  Barclays will award contracts for at least five years to
Intelenet Global Services Ltd. instead of paying cash for the
stake, the person said, declining to be identified because the
transaction hasn’t been made public.  Aviva Plc, Britain’s biggest insurer, and U.K. banks have
outsourced some services to India to reduce costs. A stake in
Intelenet will help Barclays ensure it gets the services it
requires from the company based in Mumbai.  Intelenet will announce details of a “strategic
announcement,” today, according to an invitation for a press
conference sent by the company yesterday. Intelenet “as a
policy does not comment on market speculation,” said Naini
Choudhury, a spokeswoman for the company.  The Blackstone Group “as a policy, does not comment on
market speculation,” the firm said in an e-mail response. “We
do not comment on market speculation,” said  Perry Jones , a
spokesman for Barclay’s Plc.  Intelenet is valued at $500 million to $600 million,
according to the person.  To contact the reporters on this story:
