Perilya Ltd. , a zinc and lead miner,
agreed to buy Canada’s Globestar Mining Corp. for C$184 million
($182 million), giving the Australian company an operating
copper, gold and silver project.  The Perth-based company will pay C$1.65 a share for
Globestar, a 30 percent premium on the Toronto-based miner’s
last traded share price, Perilya said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange today.  Globestar  agreed to the all-
cash offer and China’s  Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Ltd. ,
which owns 52 percent of Perilya, supports the purchase, it said.  Buying Globestar will give Perilya the Cerro de Maimon mine
and base metal exploration tenements in the Dominican Republic
and a 60 percent stake in the Moblan lithium project in Quebec.
The Australian miner operates the Broken Hill zinc, lead and
silver mine in New South Wales state and the Flinders zinc
silicate project in South Australia state.  Perilya shares , after gaining 6.8 percent yesterday, rose
2.1 percent to 48 cents at 12:48 p.m. in Sydney, giving it a
market value of A$252 million ($248 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
