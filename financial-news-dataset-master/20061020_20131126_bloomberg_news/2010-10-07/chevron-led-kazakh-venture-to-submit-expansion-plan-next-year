Chevron Corp. ’s Kazakh oil venture is
expected to submit an expansion plan next year for the Central
Asian country’s largest producing oil field, Oil & Gas Minister
 Sauat Mynbayev  said today in Almaty.  Mynbayev didn’t answer questions about the budget or
planned output increases at the TengizChevroil LLP project.
Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based spokeswoman for the venture wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  In January, KazMunaiGaz National Co. Chief Executive
Officer  Kairgeldy Kabyldin  said TengizChevroil plans to invest
 $15.2 billion  to boost oil output at the country’s largest
producing field to 36.4 million metric tons a year after 2016.
The state-run energy company owns 20 percent of the project.  The government’s cost and production estimates exceed those
given by TengizChevroil in October 2009. The venture said then
it may spend $10 billion on boosting oil output at the onshore
field by about 12 million metric tons by the end of 2016. It
produced 22.53 million metric tons last year, an increase of 30
percent from the previous year. The venture’s oil output is
expected to total 640 million tons from 2016 to 2032, Kabyldin
said at the time.  San Ramon, California-based Chevron holds 50 percent of
TengizChevroil, Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent and OAO
Lukoil’s Lukarco has 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
