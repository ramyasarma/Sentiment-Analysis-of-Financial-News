Qatar Telecom QSC  raised $1.5 billion
from a two-part bond sale after receiving investor orders for 10
times that amount.  The Doha-based company sold $1 billion of 4.75 percent
notes due in 2021 priced to yield 245 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It also issued $500 million of six-year, 3.375
percent notes priced at a 235 basis-point spread, the data show.  Qatar Telecom’s sale benefitted from a “combination of
market demand, long-term financing and attractive pricing
levels” that attracted bids for $15 billion, the company said
in an e-mailed statement.  A revival of investor confidence in the Middle East helped
spur Gulf issuance to more than $9 billion in the third quarter,
the most for a quarter since borrowers raised $16 billion in the
final three months of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Qatar Telecom will use the money to refinance debt
and for general corporate purposes, the statement said.  To contact the reporters for this story:
