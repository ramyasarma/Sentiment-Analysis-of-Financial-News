SA Metals Equity Ltd. plans to build
a 2.5 billion rand ($360 million) mine-dump processing plant in
South Africa to produce as much as 500,000 metric tons a year of
pig iron, used in steel production.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been appointed to lead an
international capital-raising for the plant, Donovan
Chimhandamba, SA Metals chairman and head of strategic project
funds at South Africa’s National Empowerment Fund, told
reporters in Johannesburg today.  The fund has invested 10 million rand in SA Metals, which
will allow a feasibility study into the project to be completed,
the fund said in a statement. The fund, a government-backed
development finance agency, is developing the project with
 Metmar Ltd. , R3 Capital Advisors Singapor Pte. Ltd., V-Projects
Ltd. and Outotec Ausmelt, a mining technology licensing company
based in Finland.  South Africa’s steel sector is dominated by  ArcelorMittal
South Africa Ltd. , a unit of the world’s largest steelmaker,
which supplies 70 percent of the country’s steel needs.  Production is expected to start in June 2014, Chimhandamba
said. The plant will generate 60 megawatts of electricity with
the company consuming half the capacity, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
