Mexico’s peso bonds rose for a fourth
day, pushing yields to a record low, as consumer prices rose
less than forecast in September.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.332 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, according to Banco Santander SA, the lowest
on record since the security was issued in 2005. The price of
the security rose 0.16 centavo to 134.24 centavos per peso.  “The inflation data was a little below consensus, which is
supporting the bond market,” said  Jorge Perez-Duarte , a
managing director for emerging markets at TD Securities Inc. in
Toronto. “The market is also pricing in any possible
quantitative easing.”  Consumer prices rose 0.52 percent last month, below the
median forecast of 0.54 percent in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S.
Federal Reserve said last month it is prepared to ease monetary
policy by buying assets to bolster the U.S. economy, the biggest
buyer of Mexican exports.  The peso dropped 0.6 percent to 12.5505 per dollar, from
12.4762 yesterday. The decline pared the currency’s gain to 4.3
percent against the dollar this year.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell 11,000 to 445,000
in the week ending Oct. 2, the  lowest level  in three months, the
Labor Department said in Washington. The U.S. purchases about 80
percent of Mexico’s exports.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. So far this month,
$400 million of dollar options have been exercised.  The bank has been auctioning $600 million of dollar options
monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks boost to
foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
