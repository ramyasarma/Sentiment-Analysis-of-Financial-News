Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in three days as the U.S. dollar rebounded from an eight-
month low, dragging on energy and raw materials producers.  Kinross Gold Corp., the country’s third-biggest producer,
slipped 2.7 percent as the metal retreated from a record close.
Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
dropped 1.4 percent as natural gas plunged after the U.S.
reported higher supplies than most analysts forecast. Canadian
Pacific Railway Ltd., Canada’s second-largest railroad,
increased 2 percent after announcing an agreement to transport
coal for Teck Resources Ltd.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 55.79
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,445.93 after the U.S. reported
jobless claims fell to a three-month low, prompting speculation
the Federal Reserve may refrain from buying more government debt
in a stimulus tactic known as quantitative easing.  “The jobless claims this morning were better than
expected, meaning the U.S. economy is not in a free fall and the
Fed is not in a rush to do the quantitative easing everyone’s
been talking about the past few weeks,” said  Stephen Gauthier ,
who helps manage about C$500 million ($493 million) as a money
manager at Fin-XO Securities in Montreal.  The S&P/TSX rose 11 percent in the 12 months ending
yesterday as gold futures soared 30 percent. The precious metal
has surged on concerns that central-bank stimulus policies to
recharge the economy will weaken currencies.  Jobless Claims  First-time applications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell
to 445,000 last week from a revised 456,000 the previous week,
the Labor Department said today in Washington. Economists had
forecast a figure of 455,000 for last week, according to the
median of 47 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey .  The U.S. dollar rebounded and gold futures fell after
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  called for a
“strong dollar” and warned of “excess volatility and
disorderly moves” in currency markets.  “The U.S. dollar has been very, very weak,” Gauthier
said. “People saw no risk on the trade, and I guess today they
were basically off track.”  Gold futures slipped 0.9 percent, the most since July 27,
to $1,335 an ounce after touching a record $1,366 an ounce in
New York. An  index  of S&P/TSX gold companies slumped the most in
four weeks.  Goldcorp Inc., the world’s second-largest gold producer by
market value, dropped 2.9 percent to C$44.41. Barrick Gold
Corp., the biggest producer, declined 1.2 percent to C$48.51.
Kinross lost 2.7 percent to C$19.23.  Discovery  Minera Andes Inc., which explores for gold, silver and
copper in Argentina, jumped 16 percent to C$2.04, the highest
since October 2007. The company announced the discovery of nine
new gold and silver veins and the extensions of two others at
its San Jose mine. Minera Andes shares have more than doubled
since Sept. 16.  S&P/TSX energy companies retreated as oil and gas prices
decreased. Natural gas sank 6.3 percent, the most since April,
after the U.S. Energy Department said  inventories  rose by 85
billion cubic feet last week, compared with the median analyst
estimate of 79 billion cubic feet.  Suncor dropped 1.4 percent to C$34.08. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, lost 0.9 percent to C$37.58. Cenovus Energy Inc.,
Canada’s sixth-largest energy company by market value, fell for
a fourth day, slipping 1.1 percent to C$29.41.  Drilling Problems  Bankers Petroleum Ltd., which produces oil and gas in
Albania, tumbled 3.4 percent to C$7.10 after reducing its 2010
year-end production target by 20 percent from previously
announced figures. The company cited drilling problems,
allocation of resources to exploration and delays in transfers
of wells from Albpetrol Sh.a.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Canada’s  second-biggest 
publicly traded copper producer, retreated for the first time in
12 days, slipping 1.6 percent to C$81.40 as copper decreased the
most in 11 weeks. The 11-day streak of gains was the longest
since at least 1988.  Canadian Pacific rose 2 percent to C$64.56 after saying it
will transport coal from five Teck mines in British Columbia to
Vancouver-area ports for 10 years. Canadian National Railway
Co., the country’s largest railroad, gained 0.9 percent to
C$66.40.  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  fell for the first time in
four days after Statistics Canada reported total building-permit
value dropped 9.2 percent in August, more than four times the
average economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-largest
insurer, declined 0.9 percent to C$12.59. Toronto-Dominion Bank,
Canada’s No. 2 lender by assets, lost 0.8 percent to C$74.68.
Sun Life Financial Inc., the country’s third-largest insurer,
decreased 1 percent to C$26.59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
