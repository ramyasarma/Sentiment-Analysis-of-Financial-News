Korea Electric Power Corp. , which won
an $18.6 billion atomic reactor order from the United Arab
Emirates in December, is in the final stage of talks with Turkey
for the construction of a nuclear power station.  A consortium led by Korea Electric will invest in the
project, Chief Executive Officer  Kim Ssang Su  told lawmakers
today in Seoul.  The Turkish government may take a stake of 60 percent in
the company that will build the country’s second nuclear power
station, Sabah newspaper reported on Oct. 4, without saying how
it got the information.  Korea Electric is proposing to take the remaining share and
will raise 70 percent of the estimated $20 billion cost through
loans, the Istanbul-based newspaper reported.  Korea Electric is also seeking to build nuclear power
plants in India and Malaysia and considers South Africa,
Thailand, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as potential markets, the
Seoul-based company said in a report to lawmakers today.  State-run Korea Electric beat General Electric Co. and
 Areva SA  to win an order to build four reactors in the U.A.E.
The company signed an agreement in March with the Turkish
government to study construction of a plant in Sinop, northeast
of Ankara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
