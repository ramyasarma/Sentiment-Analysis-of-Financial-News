Mexico’s monthly inflation rate rose
less than analysts forecast for the sixth straight month as
costs fell for fruits, vegetables and tourism packages.  Consumer prices rose 0.52 percent from a month earlier and
3.70 percent from a year earlier, the central bank said today.
Economists predicted monthly inflation of 0.54 percent and an
annual rate of 3.71 percent, according to the  median estimates 
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation surprised again to the downside,” said  Luis Arcentales , an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
“Overall, inflation seems well behaved.”  There is little risk that inflation will quicken so much
over the next few months that central bank policy makers will
raise borrowing costs, said  Pedro Tuesta , senior economist at
4Cast Inc. in New York. Prices for services are “flat,”
showing that the domestic economy remains sluggish, he said.  Costs for zucchinis fell 18.5 percent in September from the
previous month, while costs for airline tickets fell 2.7
percent, the central bank said.  The peso weakened 0.6 percent to 12.5515 per dollar at
12:03 p.m. New York time from 12.4762 yesterday.  The central bank won’t raise borrowing costs until August
2011, according to an Oct. 5 survey of economists by Citigroup
Inc.’s Banamex unit. The current pause is the longest since the
bank began targeting the overnight lending rate in 2005.  Banco de Mexico on July 28 kept its inflation forecasts
unchanged through next year, as central bank Governor  Agustin Carstens  said the institution will wait for more economic data
before making any changes to their predictions. The central bank
forecasts annual inflation will be 4.75 percent to 5.25 percent
in the fourth quarter of this year and as high as 3.25 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Mexico, Latin America’s second-largest economy, will expand
4 percent to 5 percent this year, the central bank says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
