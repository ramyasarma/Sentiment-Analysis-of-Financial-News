India’s 10-year  bonds  declined for
the fourth time in five days on speculation demand for existing
securities will wane ahead of a debt auction tomorrow.  The government plans to raise as much as 110 billion rupees
($2.5 billion) through the sale of notes due in 2017, 2022 and
2040, according to the finance ministry. The issuance is part of
the 4.47 trillion rupees total borrowing program for the year
ending March 31.  “People won’t take aggressive positions in bonds,” said
 Debendra Kumar Dash , a fixed-income trader at Development Credit
Bank in Mumbai. “The market probably will remain subdued ahead
of the debt sale.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 climbed one
basis point to 7.94 percent as of 10:29 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.05, or 5 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 99.10.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, rose to 6.63 percent from 6.62 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
