Palm oil had the biggest jump in two
weeks as some investors bought commodities as a hedge against a
weak dollar.  The December-delivery contract added 2.1 percent to 2,786
ringgit ($901) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange.
Futures touched 2,788 ringgit in intraday trading, the highest
level since May 2009.  The dollar  dropped for a third day against a basket of six
major currencies, touching the lowest since Jan. 19. Spot gold
reached a record for a third day and  silver  climbed to a 30-year
high. Copper rose to near a 27-month high and tin advanced to an
all-time high yesterday.  “People are chasing commodities as the dollar is
weakening,’ said Pawan K. Poddar, director at Poddar’s Agro
Trading Co. “There are no fundamental changes that warrant a
continued rise in palm oil.”  November-delivery soybeans in Chicago rose as much as 1.1
percent to $10.7325 a bushel, while December-delivery soybean
oil gained as much as 1.1 percent to 44.28 cents a pound in Asia.
Soybean and palm oils are direct substitutes.  “There could be some tightness in soybean oil supplies as
Argentina isn’t crushing a great deal of soybeans as China is
still not buying from them,” Poddar said. “That may lend some
support to palm oil.”  China in April banned Argentine soybean oil purchases in
retaliation for anti-dumping probes on products ranging from
elevators to textiles. Argentina is the top exporter of the
cooking oil and China is the biggest consumer.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, leapt as much as 3 percent to $899.75
a ton and was last at $896.25 at 5:16 p.m. The Dalian Commodity
Exchange is closed to mark China’s National Day celebrations and
resumes trade tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
