Soybeans rose as Asian demand for
cooking oil and livestock feed increased, boosting oilseed
shipments from the U.S., the world’s biggest producer.  U.S.  exporters  sold 947,400 metric tons of soybeans in the
week ended Sept. 30, including 624,300 tons to China, the
biggest consumer, the Department of Agriculture said today.
Accumulated  sales  in the year that began Sept. 1 are up 7.8
percent from a year earlier. U.S. exporters also sold 110,0000
tons of soybean meal to South Korea, the agency said.  “Chinese demand continues to drive U.S. business,” said
 Roy Huckabay , the executive vice president at the Linn Group in
Chicago. “Meal and oil demand is also improving.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 8.25 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $10.7025 a bushel at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Before today, the price climbed 17 percent in
the past 12 months.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second to corn at $48.6 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
