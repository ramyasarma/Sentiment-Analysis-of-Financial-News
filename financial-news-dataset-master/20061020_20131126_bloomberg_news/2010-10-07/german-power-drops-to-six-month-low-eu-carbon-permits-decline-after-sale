German power dropped to its lowest
price in more than six months as crude oil dropped. European
Union carbon-dioxide allowances declined after a sale today of
4.4 million metric tons by the U.K.  German power for next year declined 1.3 percent to 48.70
euros ($67.60) a megawatt-hour, its lowest closing price since
April 13, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Benchmark Brent crude oil, which affects the cost of fuel used
at power plants, fell 2 percent to $83.40 a barrel.  EU permits for December lost 0.6 percent to close at 15.47
euros a ton on London’s European Climate Exchange.  Carbon allowances are a cost of generation from fossil
fuels. The U.K., Europe’s second-biggest emitter, sold 4.4
million carbon-dioxide permits for 15.46 euros a metric ton at
an auction today, its 14th since November 2008. The auction
received 6.3 times more bids than offers, compared with coverage
of 6.8 times in the previous sale in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
