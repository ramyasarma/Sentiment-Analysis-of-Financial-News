Developing economies warned that low
interest rates in industrial nations are driving capital into
emerging markets, leaving them vulnerable to exchange rate
appreciations and overheating.  “The prospects of sustained low interest rates in the
advanced countries have contributed to a surge in capital flows
to some emerging markets, putting upward pressures on exchange
rates, creating overheating pressures, and carrying risks of
increased vulnerabilities and reversals,” finance officials
from the Group of 24 said in a statement after  talks  in
Washington today.  Investors have plowed a record $49.4 billion into emerging-
market stock funds this year and $39.5 billion into bond funds,
EPFR Global data show. Such flows have forced some countries to
resort to currency interventions and capital controls as they
try to safeguard their economies.  The G-24, which includes Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria, asked
the International Monetary Fund to respond by strengthening its
monitoring of such flows and to “consider options for
mitigating risks.” The concern echoes the warning of Nobel
laureate  Joseph Stiglitz  that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s use of
record low interest rates has repercussions worldwide.  “Fed policy was supposed to reignite the American
economy, but it’s not doing that,” Stiglitz, a professor at
Columbia University in New York since 2001, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “The flood of liquidity is going abroad
and causing problems all over the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
