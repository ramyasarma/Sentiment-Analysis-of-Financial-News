South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  snapped three days of gains, falling 173.87, or 0.6
percent, to 29,524.11 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  BHP Billiton Plc  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, rose 64 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 232.90 rand, its
third day of gains.  Bill Boyd , the energy and resource minister
for Saskatchewan province, said there are “serious questions”
about whether BHP Billiton’s $40 billion offer for Potash Corp.
of Saskatchewan Inc. meets the criteria of the net-benefit test.
Boyd has the power to block the transaction.  Harmony Gold Mining Co.  (HAR SJ) retreated 3.09 rand, or
3.8 percent, to 77.50 rand, the lowest level in more than a
month. Africa’s third-biggest producer of the metal said
production in the quarter through September may be 3 percent
lower than in the previous three-month period.  Keaton Energy Holdings Ltd.  (KEH SJ), a South African coal
company, rallied 16 cents, or 3.7 percent, to 4.50 rand, the
highest since Sept. 27. The company said it’s in talks that
could affect its share price.  SABMiller Plc (SAB LN), the world’s second-largest brewer,
advanced 2.86 rand, or 1.3 percent, to 220.50 rand, paring
yesterday’s 2.6 percent decline. SABMiller is not considering
offering 6 billion pounds ($89.6 billion) for Groupe Castel’s
African beer business as reported by the Times of London today,
said Guy de Clercq, the chief financial officer of BGI, Castel’s
beer unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
