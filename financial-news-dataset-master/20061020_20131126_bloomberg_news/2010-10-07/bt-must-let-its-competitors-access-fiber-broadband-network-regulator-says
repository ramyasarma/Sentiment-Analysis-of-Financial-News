BT Group Plc , the U.K.’s largest
phone company, must allow competitors to control fiber lines in
its high-speed broadband network, regulator Ofcom said.  Rivals including  TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc  should have
access to BT’s fiber lines through a “virtual link” or could
deploy their own fiber via BT’s underground ducts and overhead
telegraph poles, Ofcom said today in a statement, confirming
proposals it made in March.  BT, based in London, said in May that it would spend 2.5
billion pounds ($3.98 billion) for a high-speed network serving
two-thirds of U.K. homes by 2015. The expansion of fiber-optic
lines will help the company catch up with rivals including
Virgin Media Inc. and meet demand for increased bandwidth for
services such as downloading movies and playing video games.  “Our product provides others with substantial control,”
BT said today in an e-mailed statement. “It will be the most
likely way that fiber will be delivered in the future.” More
than 2 million premises have access to fiber broadband, it said.  The regulator decided not to set pricing for access to the
lines. Virgin Media had asked Ofcom to set fees, arguing that
the absence of any pricing controls could undermine alternative
network investment, according to the regulator. BT’s charges
will be subject to rules against anti-competitive pricing, Ofcom
said.  TalkTalk, the U.K.’s second-largest broadband company,
intends to work with BT to offer high-speed broadband via the
fiber network, Mark Schmid, a TalkTalk spokesman, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
