Corn, soybeans and wheat gained in
Chicago as the  dollar  slumped on speculation the U.S. will buy
more government debt to boost the country’s economy.  The dollar fell for the seventh time in eight sessions
against the euro to the lowest level since Feb. 3. A weaker
dollar gives overseas buyers more purchasing power when using
their own currencies. The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency
gauge of the greenback’s strength, fell as much as 0.4 percent
today and has dropped 7.3 percent since the end of August.  “No one can ignore the dollar-euro factor, which comes
very much in favor of commodities shipped out of the U.S.,”
said  Jonathan Bouchet , an analyst and trader at OTCex Group in
Geneva, in a report today. “I keep hearing more funds getting
short on the dollar. Regarding demand, it seems to be quite
strong these days, and could end up supporting the market.”  Corn for December delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $4.9375 a bushel at 10:40 a.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price has climbed 19 percent this year,
partly on speculation that consumption of the grain would
increase.  Corn also advanced on speculation that a forecast for
output in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower, will be lower
than a month earlier in a government report set to be released
tomorrow.  Lower Yields  U.S. yields may fall 5 percent this year to 156.6 bushels
an acre because of adverse weather, said Jerry Warner, chief
management officer at Farmers National Co., the largest manager
of U.S. crop land. That’s down from a record 164.7 bushels last
year and lower than the USDA’s September forecast of 162.5
bushels. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the agency to cut
its estimate to 160.2 bushels.  “The corn market was underpinned by speculation that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture will reduce its output projection
in its monthly report,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager
of research at IDO Securities Co.  Grain trading will slow as investors are reluctant to take
new positions before the USDA report, which is due to be
released tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in Washington, Kikukawa said.  The USDA’s estimate for the country’s output may drop to
12.977 billion bushels, compared with a record 13.11 billion
bushels harvested last year, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. On Sept. 10, the department reduced its estimate to
13.16 billion bushels, from 13.365 billion in August.  Soybean Crop  Soybean production may rise to 3.501 billion bushels this
year from 3.483 billion forecast in September by the USDA and a
record 3.359 billion harvested last year, according to the
Bloomberg survey.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 9.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $10.715 a bushel. Palm oil, a competing oilseed,
gained 2.1 percent today, the most in 13 days, as investors
sought a hedge against the weakening dollar.  Wheat for December delivery rose 6.75 cents, or 1 percent,
to $6.65 a bushel. The price is down 23 percent after reaching a
two-year high of $8.68 on Aug. 6. Japan today said it bought
141,350 metric tons of the grain, including about 110,500 tons
from the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 1.5 percent to 207 euros ($289) a ton.  Rough rice for November delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$12.74 per 100 pounds in Chicago after rising yesterday as high
as $12.78, the highest price since April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
