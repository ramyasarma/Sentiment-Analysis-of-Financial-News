Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle 
called for pay increases for German  employees , citing a 3.6
percent wage boost for steel workers as a possible model.  “We saw that the steel industry found a fair solution very
quickly,” Bruederle told reporters in Berlin today. “Other
industries will surely follow suit within a very short time.”  Germany’s IG Metall union announced the one-year pay deal
for steel workers on Sept. 30. The regional accord was today
backed unanimously by the union’s pay commission. Temporary
workers secured equal pay rights under the agreement.  Bruederle reiterated his forecast that the  German economy 
will grow by almost 3 percent this year after shrinking by 4.7
percent in 2009. He said he’s “optimistic” that German
companies will agree to pay increases “because it’s a broad
recovery.”  “There are some sectors that already have de-facto full
employment,” he said, without naming the industries. “We will
increasingly have problems finding qualified workers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
