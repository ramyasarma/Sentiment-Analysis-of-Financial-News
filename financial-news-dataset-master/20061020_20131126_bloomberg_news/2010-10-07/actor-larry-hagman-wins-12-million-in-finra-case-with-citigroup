Citigroup Inc. , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, lost an arbitration ruling that will force
it to pay almost $12 million in damages in a case against actor
 Larry Hagman .  A Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration board
ruled that Citigroup must pay $1.1 million in compensatory
damages and must donate $10 million of punitive damages to
charities of Hagman’s choice, according the  ruling . The bank
must also pay about $460,000 for Hagman’s attorney fees and
other costs.  The arbitration board said it enforces punitive damages
under its authority if a company “has engaged in serious
misconduct,” according to the ruling. The board didn’t provide
a reason for its decision.  “We are disappointed and disagree with the panel’s
findings, and we are reviewing our options,” said  Alexander Samuelson , a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup.  Philip Aidikoff , one of Hagman’s lawyers, didn’t return a call for
comment.  The claim, filed in May 2009, related to “unspecified
securities” in Hagman’s accounts and the purchase of a life
insurance policy. It was against the Smith Barney brokerage,
which was held within Citigroup Global Markets before Morgan
Stanley purchased a controlling stake in a joint venture with
Smith Barney last year.  Hagman has appeared in movies and television shows for more
than 50 years, according to the website IMDB.com. He played
Anthony Nelson in the TV show “I Dream of Jeannie” and J.R.
Ewing in the show “Dallas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
