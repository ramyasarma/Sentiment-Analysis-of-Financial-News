China will face a shortage of water
in the future, the Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing Hu
Siyi, vice minister of water resources. Climate change and
economic development may further worsen the imbalance in China’s
distribution of water resources, Xinhua reported, citing Hu. The
next five years will be the most crucial period for the
management of China’s water resources, Hu said, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
