Oil fell for a second day in New York
after U.S. equities declined and the dollar strengthened against
the euro as applications for U.S. unemployment benefits
unexpectedly decreased.  Futures dropped the most in three weeks yesterday, tumbling
from a five-month high, as U.S. stocks slipped after PepsiCo Inc.
lowered the top end of its annual profit forecast and Marriott
International Inc. missed earnings projections, signaling fuel
demand recovery may falter. A report today may show the U.S.
jobless rate increased for a second month in September.  “The huge spike in equities was fueling the price rise in
oil, and with the Dow cooling off, so too has the energy
market,”  Mike Sander  of Sander Capital Advisors in Seattle,
said in an e-mailed note today. “There is much uncertainty in
the market at the moment with everyone waiting to see what the
jobs report says.”  The November contract lost as much as 56 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $81.11 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $81.16 at 10:10 a.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday it shed $1.56, or 1.9 percent, to
$81.67, the biggest drop since Sept. 16. Crude is down 0.5
percent this week and 2.3 percent lower this year.  The U.S. currency was trading little changed at $1.3917
against the euro. It closed steady at $1.3926 yesterday after
advancing 0.5 percent. Jobless claims fell by 11,000 to 445,000
in the week ended Oct. 2, the fewest since July 10, Labor
Department figures released yesterday in Washington showed.  Jobless Rate  The jobless rate probably increased in September for a
second month as the year-old U.S. recovery failed to generate
enough jobs to keep up with a growing labor force. Unemployment
climbed to 9.7 percent from 9.6 percent in August, according to
the median estimate of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
ahead of a report from the Labor Department today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent to
1,158.06 in New York yesterday. The index has fallen two
straight days after closing at the highest level since May. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 19.07 points, or 0.2
percent, to 10,948.58.  U.S. crude oil supplies gained 3.09 million barrels to
360.9 million in the week ended Oct. 1, an Energy Department
report showed Oct. 6. Stockpiles were forecast to rise 413,000
barrels, according to the median of 14 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Brent crude for November settlement lost as much as 40
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $83.03 a barrel on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in London. Yesterday it declined $1.63, or 1.9
percent, to $83.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
