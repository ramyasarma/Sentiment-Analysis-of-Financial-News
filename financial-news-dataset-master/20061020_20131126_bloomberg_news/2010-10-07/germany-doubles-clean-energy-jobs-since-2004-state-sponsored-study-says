Germany has doubled the number of
jobs since 2004 in its renewable-energy industry that makes and
uses equipment for harnessing the wind, sun and biomass, the
environment ministry said.  The total of 340,000 jobs exceed previous estimates, the
ministry said today in an e-mailed statement, citing a study it
commissioned.  Europe’s largest economy set up a system of guaranteed
prices for electricity generated by renewable sources, helping
domestic companies such as Siemens AG and Solarworld AG that
build wind turbines and solar panels.  The country aims to maintain its lead in supplying
environment-related equipment such as windmills and water-
cleaning systems, Environment Minister  Norbert Roettgen  said
earlier this week in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
