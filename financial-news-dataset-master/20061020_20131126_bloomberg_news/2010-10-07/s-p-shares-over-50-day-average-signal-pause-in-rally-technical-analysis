Individual investors should be wary
of buying stocks now because most  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
companies are trading above their average prices for the past 50
days, signaling a short-term retreat, according to Bespoke
Investment Group LLC.  The proportion of stocks in the benchmark index above their
50-day average has reached 91 percent, a sign that stocks may
retreat from “overbought levels” before resuming their rally,
 Justin Walters , Bespoke’s co-founder, said yesterday.  When half of all stocks are above their 50-day moving
average, it indicates a healthy market to technical analysts,
according to Walters. Of the  10 industries  in the S&P 500, only
financial companies are below their 50-day average after the
benchmark index climbed 8.8 percent last month for its best
September gain since 1939.  “A reading this high can precede a short-term pullback,”
Walters said in an interview. “There’s a lot of momentum behind
this rally, but it’s something to take caution of. It doesn’t
mean we’re due for imminent decline, but it’s risky to be buying
here in the short term. It’s not a glaring ‘sell’ signal, and
it’s not a glaring ‘buy’ signal.”  The 90 percent threshold wasn’t eclipsed from 2006 to 2008.
In the four instances since March 2009, the S&P 500 fell twice
and climbed twice in the subsequent week, according to Bespoke.  Based on past performance, the indicator may be signaling a
resumption of the rally, once companies start providing  earnings
forecasts , Walters said.  Longer-Term Gains  The S&P surged in three of the four three-month periods
following “overbought” signals, Bespoke data showed. The
exception was in April, when the S&P started a 14 percent plunge
over the next three months, partially a result of the 20-minute
market crash on May 6 that erased $862 billion from the value of
U.S. shares.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,159.97 yesterday.  All 10 industry groups in the S&P 500 and all 30 stocks in
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced last month as
investors gained confidence that the world’s largest economy
will evade a double-dip recession and speculated that the
Federal Reserve will buy more debt to support the recovery.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
