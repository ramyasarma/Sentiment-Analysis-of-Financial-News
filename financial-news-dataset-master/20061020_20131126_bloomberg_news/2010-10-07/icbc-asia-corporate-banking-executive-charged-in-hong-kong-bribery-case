An executive from  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Ltd.  and two other people were
released on bail after being charged in a bribery case brought
by Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption.  Derick Chan Po-fui, 50, head of the corporate banking
department, and Chan Yick-yiu, 43, former head of real estate
and finance at the bank, were charged, the anti-graft agency
said in a statement yesterday. Zeng Wei, 47, a major shareholder
of United Win Holdings Ltd., was also charged, the ICAC said.  ICBC (Asia), a unit of Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd., the world’s biggest lender by market value, had no
comment, spokeswoman  Hilda Chow  said by phone. The bank
cooperated in the investigation, code-named “Thunderbolt,” the
ICAC said. No phone number was available for United Win.  The defendants face nine charges, including one count that
alleged Derick Chan accepted bribes of HK$1 million and HK$2.3
million from Zeng to extend the due date for repayment of loans,
the ICAC said.  Chan Yick-yiu is charged with accepting bribes of
HK$500,000 and HK$2 million for helping Zeng and his companies
prepare loan proposals with the bank.  The defendants appeared in Eastern Magistracy yesterday
without entering pleas. Zeng was granted cash bail of HK$800,000
and the other two defendants HK$500,000 each. They were ordered
to surrender their travel documents and not to interfere with
prosecution witnesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
