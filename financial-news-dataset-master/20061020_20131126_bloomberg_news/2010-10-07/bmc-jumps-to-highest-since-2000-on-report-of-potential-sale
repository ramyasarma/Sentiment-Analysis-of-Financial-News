BMC Software Inc.  climbed the most in
more than a year in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after a report
the business-software maker may be putting itself up for sale.  The shares jumped 6.7 percent after DealReporter said BMC
may have started exploring a sale two weeks ago. The news
service cited three industry bankers and an executive familiar
with the situation. Houston-based BMC has a market value of
about $7.6 billion.  BMC, which makes business-management programs as well as
software that manage mainframes and computer servers, may be
able to help technology companies consolidate their software and
hardware data-center offerings. Oracle Corp. and SAP AG are the
most likely buyers because Hewlett-Packard Co. and International
Business Machines Corp. already have systems-management
software, one banker told DealReporter.  One banker said BMC hired Morgan Stanley to start a sales
process two weeks ago, according to DealReporter. Another banker
said Bank of America Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley was
shopping BMC in an “informal way,” the news service reported.  BMC doesn’t comment on rumors or speculation, a
spokeswoman, Jennifer Brenner, said in an e-mail.  BMC  climbed  $2.67 to $42.32 at 4:30 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the biggest percentage jump since
March 23, 2009. The shares have gained 5.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
