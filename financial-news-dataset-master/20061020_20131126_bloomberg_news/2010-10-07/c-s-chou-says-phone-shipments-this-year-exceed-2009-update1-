HTC Corp. , the world’s largest maker
of handsets using Microsoft Corp. and Google Inc. operating
systems, said it has already shipped more this year than the
whole of 2009.  Demand remains strong in the U.S. and Europe this quarter,
Chief Executive Officer  Peter Chou  said today in Taipei. The
company shipped 11 million units last year.  HTC yesterday reported  September sales  that missed analyst
estimates with the company saying a switch between old and new
models hurt shipments. A shortage of components which had
affected sales this year has already eased, Chou said.  Shipments of its Desire HD and Desire Z handsets combined
will exceed 1 million units by the end of the year, Chou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
