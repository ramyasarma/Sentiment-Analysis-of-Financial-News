Kuwaiti banks can lend 1.73 billion
dinars ($6.1 billion) without exceeding the loans-to-deposits
ratio limit,  Al-Qabas  reported, citing the country’s Central
Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul Aziz Al-Sabah.  “On the basis of the maximum loans-to-deposit ratio, set
at 85 percent, Kuwaiti banks had, by the end of June 2010,
additional room for extending 1.73 billion dinars in loans
before reaching the limit,” Sheikh Salem said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
