Corn  production in Brazil, the
world’s third-largest producer, may fall as much as 7.5 percent
next year as below-average rainfall pares yields and the planted
area.  Farmers will harvest between 51.8 million metric tons and
52.4 million tons, down from 56 million tons this year, the
Agriculture Ministry’s crop-forecasting agency said today in an
e-mailed report.  Corn farmers may trim the planted area by as much as 2.1
percent to between 12.7 million and 12.8 million hectares (31.4
million and 31.6 million acres), Conab said. A dry spell in
Brazil’s Center-South and irregular rains in the South due to
the La Nina weather pattern may pare yields and make the soil
too dry to plant, according to the report.  “The government has the conditions to meet local demand
for corn, which gives us some tranquility, because of the big
volume of stockpiles,”  Silvio Porto , a director at Conab, said
today at a press conference in Brasilia.  The government has 5.5 million metric tons of corn in
inventories, enough to meet domestic consumption needs, he said.
Exports of the commodity may fall to 8 million tons from 9.5
million tons this year, he said.  Corn for December delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $4.9375 a bushel at 10:40 a.m. London time on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price has climbed 19 percent this year.  Soybean  output in Brazil, the world’s  largest grower  after
the U.S., will total between 67.6 million and 68.9 million tons
next year, Conab said today. That compares with production of
68.7 million tons this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
