Latvia should adopt the 2011 budget
this year, even though the law allows the government to delay
approval because of last weekend’s parliamentary elections,
Prime Minister  Valdis Dombrovskis  told  Dienas Bizness .  The government may double the residential property tax,
with the highest rate rising to 0.6 percent from 0.3 percent,
cut the state’s contribution to worker pension programs for two
years and reduce spending by ministries to narrow the budget
deficit to 6 percent next year, Dombrovskis said in an interview
with the Riga-based newspaper.  Dombrovskis said he didn’t think there could be changes in
the shortfall allowed by the European Commission and the
International Monetary Fund next year, though he didn’t rule out
raising the issue if coalition members wish to do so, the paper
reported.  Dombrovskis’ three-party government won 63 seats in the
100-member legislature, up from 45 in the last parliament, in
the elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
