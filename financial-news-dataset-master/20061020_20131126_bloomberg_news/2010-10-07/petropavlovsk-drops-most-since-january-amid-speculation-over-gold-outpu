Petropavlovsk Plc , Russia’s third-
largest gold producer, fell as much as 7.5 percent in London
trading, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 22, after the
Financial Times’s Alphaville blog said analysts may lower their
production forecasts for the company.  The stock was down 5.3 percent at 1,077 pence as of 9:15
a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
