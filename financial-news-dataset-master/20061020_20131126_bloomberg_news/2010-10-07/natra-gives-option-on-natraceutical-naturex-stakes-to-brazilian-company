Natra SA , Spain’s largest maker of
cocoa products, granted options to Bio Group Brazil for its 47
percent stake in  Natraceutical SA  and a 3.89 percent holding in
 Naturex SA .  Bio Group Brazil, a unit of Davene, has the option to
acquire part or all of the stock considered in the contracts for
43 euro cents per Natraceutical share and 35.3 euros per Naturex
share, the Spanish company said in a regulatory filing. Should
Bio Group Brazil decide to purchase more than 30 percent of
Natraceutical through the option, it would then extend the offer
to all shareholders at the same price, Natra said.  Natraceutical also agreed to form a joint venture with Bio
Group Brazil to sell its Forte Pharma weight-loss treatments in
the Latin American country, Natra said. Natraceutical plans to
seek a stock market listing in Brazil, according to the filing.  Natra shares gained 3 percent to 2.09 euros in Madrid
trading. Natraceutical climbed 6.5 percent to 39.3 euro cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
