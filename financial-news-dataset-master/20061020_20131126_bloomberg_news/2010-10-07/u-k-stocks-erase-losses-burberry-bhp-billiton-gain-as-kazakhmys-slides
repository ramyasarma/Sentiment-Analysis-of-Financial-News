U.K. stocks erased their losses, as
gains by BHP Billiton Plc and Burberry Group Plc offset declines
by Kazakhmys Plc and Wolseley Plc.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index was little changed, adding
less than 0.1 percent to 5,684.19 at 9:07 a.m. in London, after
earlier dropping as much as 0.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
