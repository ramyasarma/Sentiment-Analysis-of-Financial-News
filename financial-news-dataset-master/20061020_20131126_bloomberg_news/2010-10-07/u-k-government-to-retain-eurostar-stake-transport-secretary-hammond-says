Britain is likely to retain its stake
in Channel Tunnel rail operator Eurostar Group Ltd., Transport
Secretary Stephen Hammond said today.  The U.K. has a 40 percent stake in Eurostar following its
reorganization as a single company, with French state SNCF, or
Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer, holding 55 percent and
Belgian railway SNCB the remaining 5 percent.  “Our view on Eurostar is that this is a ‘hold’,” Hammond
said at a press conference in London. “But of course, like any
prudent investor, we will look at our holdings in years
to come.”  The former Labour government had indicated that the British
stake, controlled by Eurostar UK Ltd., might be sold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
