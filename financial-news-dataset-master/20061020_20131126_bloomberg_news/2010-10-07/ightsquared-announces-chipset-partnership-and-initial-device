Nokia Oyj , the world’s biggest maker
of mobile phones, will develop devices for  Philip Falcone ’s
LightSquared venture, which plans to offer wireless service to
260 million people within the next five years in the U.S.  The Finnish handset maker will provide LightSquared
customers with “branded, data-centric” products, Reston,
Virginia-based LightSquared said today in a statement, without
elaborating.  The venture plans to compete with  Sprint Nextel Corp. ,  AT&T
Inc.  and  Verizon Wireless  by selling capacity on its so-called
4G network to partners such as consumer-electronics companies
and retailers. It is building its network in as many as nine
U.S. metro areas by the end of next year, according to company
documents distributed late last year.  The company aims to supplement its wireless network with
satellite coverage.  Qualcomm Inc. , the largest maker of mobile-
phone chips, will develop chips allowing manufacturers to build
devices that can access both satellite and cellular networks,
LightSquared said today.  LightSquared is backed by billionaire Falcone’s Harbinger
Capital Partners hedge fund and uses assets gained through the
acquisition of SkyTerra Communications Inc. The venture said in
July it had obtained $1.75 billion in initial funding
commitments.  LightSquared plans to begin trials in Baltimore, Phoenix,
Las Vegas and Denver by early 2011 and has committed to spending
$7 billion over eight years through an agreement with Nokia
Siemens Networks, which will build and manage the network. Both
Nokia Siemens and LightSquared’s boards have approved the
agreement, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
