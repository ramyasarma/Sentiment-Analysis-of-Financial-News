Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade
called for an “emergency” review of the country’s failing
electric grid and an audit of state-run electricity company
SENELEC, the Agence de Presse Senegalese reported, citing a
summary of an all-ministers’ conference in Dakar.  Up to five power outages a day, each averaging five hours,
are costing Senegal’s formal sector businesses 9.6 million West
African CFA francs ($20,445) daily in lost revenue every day,
according to an Oct. 3 report by the state statistical agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
