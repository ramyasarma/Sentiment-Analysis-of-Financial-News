Incentives offered by the Obama
administration to Israel may allow Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  to push through his Cabinet a limited renewal of the
freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank, Israel’s
ambassador to the U.S. said.  “The U.S. has come back to Israel with a number of
suggestions, incentives if you would, that enable the government
to maybe pass a limited extension of two or three months,”
Ambassador  Michael Oren  told the  Washington Post .  Netanyahu has told his Cabinet that he is trying to keep
the negotiations, which began in Washington Sept. 2, from
falling apart over Palestinian demands for a renewal of the 10-
month construction moratorium that ended Sept. 26.  The Israeli leader faces opposition to any renewal of the
freeze in his Cabinet, in which most ministers support
settlement building.  Netanyahu this week said that he was “engaged in sensitive
diplomatic contacts with the Americans to find a solution” that
would allow talks to continue after Palestinian Authority
President  Mahmoud Abbas  said he wouldn’t negotiate unless
construction halted.  Abbas goes to the Arab League tomorrow to seek support for
his position.  Oren said the Americans are also in discussion with the
Palestinians “trying to keep them at the table,” and talking
to the Arab League so it will "give the Palestinian leadership
another green light to continue at the table.’’  “All of this is converging in the next 48 hours and by
Friday we will have a clearer picture,” Oren told the Post in
an interview yesterday. He didn’t elaborate on what the U.S.
incentives might be.  To contact the reporter on this story:
