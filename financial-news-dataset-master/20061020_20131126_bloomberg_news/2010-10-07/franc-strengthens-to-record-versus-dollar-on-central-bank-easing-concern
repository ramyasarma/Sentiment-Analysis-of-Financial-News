The franc weakened versus the euro
after the European Central Bank signaled it won’t engage in more
monetary easing, damping the Swiss currency’s appeal as a haven.  The franc also strengthened to a record against the dollar.
“The Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB
interest rates as appropriate,” said ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  at a press conference in Frankfurt today, after the
central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent.  “Trichet did not sound particularly concerned about the
strength of the euro and this offers it a boost across the
board,” said  Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at
UniCredit SpA in Milan. “The euro-franc has declined in the
wake of this, and the dollar-Swiss franc managed to hold the
line at 85 centimes and has now edged back.”  The franc traded 0.4 percent weaker against the euro at
1.3442 as of 3:12 p.m. in London, depreciating for the third
consecutive day. It was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.44 centimes per
dollar, after earlier reaching 95.55 centimes to set a third
record in as many days, according to Bloomberg data.  Investors traditionally buy the franc during times of
economic turmoil because of the perceived stability of
Switzerland’s economy and current account surplus, and offload
the currency when they want to take on more risk.  The franc has climbed 4.8 percent this year against a
basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
