Turkish Communications Minister
Binali Yildirim said he opposes any ban on Research in Motion
Ltd.’s Blackberry services in the country.  The telecommunications regulator is examining security
issues associated with Blackberry services, Yildirim said in
televised comments carried by the CNBC-e channel from Ankara
today.  “I don’t favor banning Blackberry,” Yildirim said. “They
will either comply with new regulation on coded mail traffic or
the new regulation will let it continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
