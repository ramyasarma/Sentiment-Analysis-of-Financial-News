Brazilian Central Bank President
 Henrique Meirelles  said there’s a risk of bubbles forming in
several asset classes as a result of excess global liquidity.  Meirelles said today that policy makers at the central bank
are drying up “excessive liquidity” in the economy by building
up  reserves  and adopting “prudential rules” to prevent this
liquidity from being channeled into the  financial system .  “There is an excessive liquidity coming into the country.
One of the risks is a bubble formation of several asset
prices,” Meirelles told investors at an event in Miami today.
“We are carefully monitoring all of that.”  The government is trying to temper a four month rally in
the currency that has strengthened the real by 11.5 percent to
1.6842 per U.S. dollar at 3:34 New York time. Earlier this week,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  doubled the tax foreigners must
pay to invest in domestic fixed-income securities and funds.  Meirelles said the higher tax aims to “decrease somewhat”
the pressure resulting from the carry trade, whereby investors
borrow money in countries with lower interest rates to profit
from higher returns offered elsewhere.  Brazil offers investors the second-highest interest rate of
the Group of 20 Nations after Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
