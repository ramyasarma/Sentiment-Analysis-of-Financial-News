The krona’s one-week, 1.9 percent
drop against the euro is a buying opportunity because the
currency may gain to below 9 per euro before the end of the
year, SEB AB said.  Investors should buy the krona against the euro, targeting
a gain to 8.9 per euro, and should leave the bet if the currency
weakens to above 9.55 per euro,  Carl Hammer , the chief foreign
exchange strategist at SEB in Stockholm, wrote in an e-mailed
note today. The krona gained 0.2 percent to 9.3333 per euro as
of 10:27 a.m. in Stockholm. It was at 9.19 per euro by the end
of Sept. 30.  “We see the recent krona weakness related most probably to
the Renault divestment of Volvo shares as a good opportunity to
enter a fresh” position against the euro, Hammer wrote. “The
krona is not yet sufficiently strong to slow our anticipated
pace of Riksbank hikes during the reminder of 2010.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
