Petropavlovsk Plc , Russia’s third-
largest gold producer, said it’s “striving” to hit its full-
year production target after output was hampered by delayed
equipment deliveries.  “The on-time delivery of mining equipment has been and
remains an important issue for the company in order for it to
achieve the demanding production target for 2010,” London-based
Petropavlovsk said in a statement today.  The company said it produced about 140,000 ounces of gold
in the third quarter, bringing total production in the first
nine months to about 305,000 ounces. First-half attributable
output fell to 166,300 ounces from 224,600 ounces a year earlier
after the equipment delays and cold weather.  In August, the company said it may miss its 670,000-ounce
to 760,000-ounce full-year production target by as much as 5
percent.  Petropavlovsk earlier fell as much as 7.5 percent in London
trading, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 22, after the
Financial Times’s Alphaville blog said analysts may lower their
output forecasts for the company.  Petropavlovsk said there are continuing delays in the
manufacture and delivery of the two new excavators used for
mining. It said it’s “reviewing and optimizing its mining
schedules” at its Pioneer mine to deal with the delays.  Petropavlovsk fell 6.3 percent to 1,065 pence as of 4:11
p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
