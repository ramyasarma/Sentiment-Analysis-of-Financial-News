Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
biggest seller of hybrid cars, gave U.S. dealers a first look at
an electric sport-utility vehicle developed with affiliate  Tesla
Motors Inc.  as Toyota prepares to boost sales of advanced autos.  The RAV4 EV that Toyota plans to sell in the U.S. by 2012
was shown at Toyota’s annual dealer meeting in Las Vegas
yesterday, said Tesla Chief Executive Officer  Elon Musk , who
appeared at the meeting with Toyota President  Akio Toyoda .  Musk, reached via e-mail, and  Mike Michels , a Toyota
spokesman, declined to discuss details of the meeting.  Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, bought a $50 million
stake in Palo Alto, California-based Tesla this year to
collaborate in battery-powered vehicles. Tesla, which this month
acquired Toyota’s former joint-venture plant in Fremont,
California, is providing the battery pack, motor and electronic
controls for the compact SUV.  Toyota said in a statement yesterday it’s readying a range
of advanced vehicles, including more hybrids, plug-in hybrids,
electric cars and fuel-cell vehicles, without elaborating.  Tesla, also partially owned by Daimler AG, yesterday opened
its new headquarters to the media, showing its battery and
electric-motor assembly lines and engineering labs for the first
time. Along with the electric RAV4, Tesla is supplying lithium-
ion battery packs and other components for electric versions of
Daimler’s Smart and Mercedes A-Class small cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
