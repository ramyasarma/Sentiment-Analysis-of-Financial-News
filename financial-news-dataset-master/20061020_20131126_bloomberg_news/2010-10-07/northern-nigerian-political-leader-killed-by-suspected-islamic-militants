Gunmen suspected to be members of a
radical Islamic sect launched two separate attacks in  Nigeria’s 
northeastern city of Maiduguri, killing a political leader and
injuring a policeman, a security official said.  The attackers, who were riding on motorbikes, “shot and
killed” Awana Ngala yesterday, a leader of the All Nigeria
People’s Party, which controls Borno state, said Mai Mamman, a
police spokesman in the region.  A similar attack was made yesterday on the residence of the
speaker of the state legislature, Goni Ali Modu, in which a
police guard was shot and injured, Mamman said by phone today
from Maiduguri, the state capital. The attacks are suspected to
be the work of the Boko Haram sect, he said.  The group, which opposes Western-style education and draws
inspiration from Afghanistan’s Taliban, attacked police stations
across several northern Nigerian cities in July 2009, prompting
the government to deploy troops. At least 700 people died in the
fighting, leading Nigeria’s security forces to shell the sect’s
headquarters in Maiduguri. Boko Haram’s 39-year-old leader,
Mohammed Yusuf, was killed.  Gunmen suspected of belonging to the sect last month
attacked a prison in the northern city of Bauchi, freeing 721
inmates, including scores of its members awaiting trial for the
2009 violence.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer and most populous
country with about 140 million people, is roughly divided
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
