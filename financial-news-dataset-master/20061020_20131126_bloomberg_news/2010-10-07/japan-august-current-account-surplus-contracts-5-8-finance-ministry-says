Japan’s current-account surplus
narrowed in August as export growth slowed, adding to signs the
country’s economic recovery is moderating.  The  gap  contracted 5.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.114
trillion yen ($13 billion), the Ministry of Finance said in
Tokyo today. The median estimate of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a surplus of 1.023 trillion yen. Exports
climbed 16.5 percent, while imports gained 20.5 percent.  The government has intervened in the foreign-exchange
market and the central bank eased policy on concern the yen’s
continuing gains against the dollar will derail Japan’s export-
driven recovery. Expiring stimulus packages mean Japan can’t
expect the domestic economy to drive growth either, according to
economist  Yoshiki Shinke .  “There’s no doubt the economy is slowing,” said Shinke,
senior economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
On top of demand that’s slowing in China and other trading
partners, “we’ll begin to see the strong yen’s impact on
exports very soon,” he said.  Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa ’s board this week unexpectedly
cut the central banks’ benchmark interest rate, pledged to keep
borrowing costs at “virtually zero” until price stability
returns and established a 5 trillion-yen asset-purchasing fund.
Japan’s ruling party proposed an economic stimulus in excess of
4.8 trillion yen that would help local governments and small
businesses create jobs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
