Serena Williams  will return to the
women’s tennis tour next week in Linz, Austria, after recovering
from a foot injury that kept her out since July.  Williams, 29, said in a statement on the tournament’s
website today that she had “finally got the green light” after
her doctor advised her against playing in Tokyo and Beijing
because her fitness wasn’t 100 percent.  When she takes to the courts next week, Williams will be
ranked the No. 2 player in the world behind Denmark’s  Caroline Wozniacki , who earlier ensured she’ll take over as No. 1 by
advancing to the quarterfinals at the China Open.  Williams, who has held the top spot for a total of 123
weeks during her career, hasn’t played since winning her 13th
Grand Slam singles championship at Wimbledon. The American had
foot surgery the same month after walking through glass at a
restaurant in Munich, she told USA Today in September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
