South Africa won’t send soldiers to
Somalia to help peacekeepers quell an insurgency and combat
piracy in the war-torn Horn of Africa nation, Business Day
reported, citing Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, the foreign minister.  In July, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs Johnnie Carson said South Africa could play a positive
role in reining in insurgents that threaten international peace
and security, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
