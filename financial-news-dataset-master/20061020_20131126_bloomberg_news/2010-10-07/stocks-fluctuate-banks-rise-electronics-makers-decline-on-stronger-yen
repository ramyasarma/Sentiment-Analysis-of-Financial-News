Japan’s  Topix  index climbed, led by
banks and retailers, on expectations monetary easing by the Bank
of Japan will boost domestic demand. Electronics makers dropped
as the yen strengthened.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest
publicly traded bank, gained 1 percent. Aeon Co., the nation’s
second-largest retailer, jumped 6 percent after boosting its
full-year profit forecast. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.,
Japan’s No. 3 developer, climbed 1.7 percent. Advantest Corp.,
the world’s biggest maker of chip testers, slid 2 percent. Canon
Inc., a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of its revenue
from overseas, lost 1.3 percent.  The Topix index rose 0.2 percent to 846.06 at the close in
Tokyo, with almost twice as many shares rising as falling. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  slid less than 0.1 percent to 9,684.81,
after rising as much as 0.3 percent.  “There’s a sense of expectation that the money-easing will
boost domestic demand and the economy,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , a
fund manager in Tokyo who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin
Asset Management Co. “The stronger yen against the dollar is
weighing on the stock market.”  The Topix has dropped 15 percent from its high this year on
April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps to curb property
prices and concern about the pace of U.S. economic growth
weakened confidence in a global recovery. Stocks in the index
trade at 15.1 times estimated earnings on average, compared with
13.8 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 and 12.1 times for the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Retailers Advance  The Bank of Japan cut its overnight call rate target this
week to a range of zero to 0.1 percent from 0.1 percent and
established a 5-trillion-yen ($60 billion) fund to buy
government bonds and other assets including real-estate
investment trusts.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group gained 1 percent to 405 yen.
Resona Holdings Inc. increased 1.8 percent to 722 yen. Banks
extended gains to a third day and were the biggest contributor
to the Topix’s gain among its 33 industry groups.  Aeon jumped 6 percent to 976 yen after the retailer said
net income may climb to between 49 billion yen and 55 billion
yen for the fiscal year ending February, compared with its
previous estimate of as much as 38 billion yen. Seven & I
Holdings Co., Japan’s largest retailer, climbed 3.9 percent to
2,051 yen. Fast Retailing Co., the nation’s No. 1 clothing
retailer, rose 0.8 percent to 12,680, the biggest support to the
Nikkei, followed by Seven & I and Aeon.  Developers Climb  Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.  increased 1.7 percent to
1,873 yen and its bigger rivals Mitsui Fudosan Co. and
Mitsubishi Estate Co. both gained at least 1.4 percent.  “Developers will directly benefit from the cut in interest
rates and indirectly benefit from purchases of real-estate
investment trusts,” Shinkin Asset’s Fujiwara said.  Shipping lines gained after bulk cargo tariffs increased.
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s third-largest shipping line,
advanced 2.2 percent to 320 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the
operator of the world’s largest merchant fleet, increased 2.3
percent to 539 yen. The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping rates for
commodities jumped 2.7 percent yesterday, rising for a fourth
day.  Electronics manufacturers dropped as the yen appreciated.
Advantest slumped 2 percent to 1,730 yen. Canon lost 1.3 percent
to 3,875 yen and was the heaviest drag on the Topix. Fanuc Ltd.,
Japan’s No. 1 manufacturer of industrial robots, slid 1.6
percent to 10,850 yen, the  biggest contributor  to declines in
the Nikkei 225.  The yen strenghtened to 82.77 against the dollar at about 1
a.m. today in Tokyo from 83.13 at the close of stock trading
yesterday. That’s the strongest level since May 1995 and
compares with the 82.88 reached on Sept. 15, the day Japan’s
government said it intervened in the foreign-exchange market to
weaken the currency for the first time since 2004.  -- Editors:  Sam Waite ,  Nicolas Johnson .  To contact the reporter for this story:
