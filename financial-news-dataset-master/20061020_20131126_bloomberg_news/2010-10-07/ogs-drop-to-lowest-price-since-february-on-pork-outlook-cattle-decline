Hog futures declined to the lowest
level since February as U.S. demand for pork trailed supplies.
Cattle futures were little changed.  Slaughterhouses have processed 1.268 million hogs this
week, 1.4 percent more than in the same period last week, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Wholesale-pork prices  fell
4.3 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since September 2009,
and  hogs  for immediate delivery to slaughterhouses were the
cheapest since July 15, according to the USDA.  The market is “seeing more hogs show up and prices are
reacting,” said  Rich Nelson , the director of research at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Illinois. “The negative price news
for cash hogs” and pork also is pressuring futures, he said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.9 cent, or 1.2
percent, to settle at 71.3 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, prices reached 70.55
cents, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Feb.
25. The commodity has jumped 8.7 percent this year.  Wholesale pork fell yesterday to 81.56 cents a pound, down
16 percent since Aug. 24, when the price was the highest since
at least 1997, USDA data show. Hogs for immediate delivery
slipped to 74.26 cents a pound, down 5.9 percent in the past
month.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.025 cent to
settle at 97.1 cents a pound on the CME. The commodity has
gained 13 percent in 2010. Wholesale  choice-beef  prices were
little changed at midday and yesterday, after falling for five
sessions.  “The U.S. retail end of things is still a little bit
sloppy,” said  Dick Quiter , an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC in Chicago. “That could keep some continued
pressure on cattle. They really have to find some life from the
retail end.”  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement fell 0.275
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $1.08975 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
