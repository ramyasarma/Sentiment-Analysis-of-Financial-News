The Australian dollar was within two
U.S. cents of parity with the greenback on speculation the
Federal Reserve will debase the currency by increasing purchases
of government debt to boost a stalling recovery.  The Aussie rallied for an eighth week in the longest
stretch of gains since May 2009 after a U.S. government report
showed employers eliminated more jobs in September than
economists forecast. The New Zealand dollar gained for a third
week versus the U.S. currency.  “The U.S. economy is going to grow tepidly below trend,
and they are going to continue to push the envelope on
quantitative policy easing,” said  Greg Gibbs , a currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney. “We
are going to try parity this year.”  Australia’s currency climbed 0.3 percent to 98.54 U.S.
cents at 12:39 p.m. in New York, from 98.25 cents yesterday,
when it touched 99.18, the highest level since exchange controls
ended in 1983. The currency rallied 1.3 percent this week. New
Zealand’s currency gained 0.4 percent to 75.29 U.S. cents,
extending its weekly increase to 1.1 percenet.  U.S. employers cut staffing by 95,000 workers after a
revised 57,000 decrease in August, Labor Department figures in
Washington showed today. The median forecast of 87 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey for a drop of 5,000. The  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly held at 9.6 percent.  The Aussie touched a record high versus the greenback
yesterday as stronger-than-expected Australian employment data
added to speculation the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
raising interest rates.  There’s a 59 percent  probability  policy makers will
increase the 4.50 percent target lending rate on Nov. 2,
according to Credit Suisse Group AG. The probability was 41
percent on Oct. 6, a day before the government said Australia’s
employers added 49,500 workers in September, more than double
the median economist estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
