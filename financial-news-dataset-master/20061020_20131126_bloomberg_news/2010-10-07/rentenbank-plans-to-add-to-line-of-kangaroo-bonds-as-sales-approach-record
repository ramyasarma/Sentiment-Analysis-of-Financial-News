Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank,
Germany’s development agency for agribusiness, plans to add at
least A$250 million ($246 million) to its existing line of
kangaroo bonds, as sales of the notes head for a record year.  The 6.5 percent bonds due in April 2017 will be priced
today, according to an e-mailed statement from JPMorgan Chase &
Co., which is helping manage the sale with Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG.  The bonds may be priced to yield about 57 basis points more
than the swap rate, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who asked not to be identified as the matter is
private. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Borrowers have sold A$31.3 billion of kangaroo bonds this
year, approaching the record A$32.4 billion in 2006, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kangaroo bonds are Australian-
dollar notes sold by foreign issuers in the nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
