U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures
may climb as high as 136 18/32 after the contract surpassed a
key resistance level yesterday,  ING Groep NV  said, citing
technical indicators.  The December 30-year bond futures contract closed yesterday
at 134 26/32, above “horizontal resistance” at 134 15/32,
which “suggests a test of the recent highs,”  Roelof-Jan Van den Akker , an Amsterdam-based senior technical analyst at ING,
wrote in a report today. “The downside within this
consolidation is limited and we recommend buying each dip to the
fifty-day moving average line at 132 17/32.”  The bond futures traded at 134 16/32 today, down 10/32 or
0.23 percent. The yield on the cash 30-year bond was 3.708
percent.  U.S. two-year note yields dropped to a record low before a
report tomorrow that’s forecast to show a rise in the
unemployment rate, pointing to a slowing economic recovery.
Treasury yields have declined this week as investors bet the
Federal Reserve will follow the Bank of Japan in purchasing more
bonds, a strategy known as quantitative easing.  Van der Akker wrote a break above resistance at 138 3/32
would signal a continuation of the uptrend for the 30-year bond
futures toward the overhead 142 14/32 resistance area.  Moving averages are used to identify trends and find
support or resistance. Support is a level where buy orders may
be clustered and resistance is where there may be sell orders.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
