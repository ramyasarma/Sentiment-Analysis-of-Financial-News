Job openings in the U.S. rose in
August as more companies prepared to add staff amid signs demand
was holding up, a government report showed.  Openings  increased by 60,000 to 3.2 million, the Labor
Department said today in Washington. The number of people hired
dropped from the prior month and separations also decreased.  Companies added 75,000 jobs in September, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before
the government’s monthly jobs report tomorrow, after a 67,000
gain in August. Faster job growth is needed to bring down the
 unemployment rate  and spur consumer spending.  “Job openings versus losses have been moving in a positive
direction,”  Carl Riccadonna , a senior U.S. economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, said before the
report. “The labor market is healing. The trend is in place and
I don’t think it’s getting derailed.”  Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly
fell last week to the lowest level in three months, another
indication the labor market may be thawing, other figures from
the Labor Department showed today.  Jobless claims  dropped by 11,000 to 445,000 in the week
ended Oct. 2, the fewest since July 10, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. The  median forecast  or 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 455,000 new claims last
week. The total number of people receiving unemployment
insurance decreased and those getting extended payments jumped.  Shares Fluctuate  Stocks fluctuated between gains and losses after the
reports, depressed by shares of mining and energy companies as
commodity prices retreated. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index
fell 0.2 percent to 1,158.2 at 11:17 a.m. in New York.  The rate of job openings held at 2.4 percent in August for
a second month, according to today’s report. Companies in the
professional and business services industries showed the biggest
gain in jobs available, followed by government agencies and
hotels and restaurants.  Compared with the 14.9 million Americans who were
unemployed in August, the figures indicate there are about 4.7
people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the
recession began in December 2007.  The report helps provide insights into the dynamics behind
the monthly employment and claims figures.  August Payrolls  Total payrolls fell by 54,000 in August, pulled lower by
firings of temporary census workers, the Labor Department
reported on Sept. 3.  The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent from 9.5 percent
in July, as more people entered the workforce, the Labor
Department report showed.  Employers took on 4.14 million workers in August, today’s
report showed, down from 4.28 million the previous month. Total
firings, which exclude those who left their jobs voluntarily and
retirements, dropped to 1.83 million in August from 2.11 million
a month earlier.  The level of dismissals was the lowest in four months, the
best indication yet that the increase in jobless claims during
August was an aberration. Workers trying to reapply for extended
and emergency jobless benefits may have mistakenly filed initial
claims, artificially inflating applications,  John Ryding , chief
economist at RDQ Economics LLC in New York, said in a note to
clients after the claims report.  President Barack Obama on July 22 signed into law a measure
restoring unemployment benefits that had run out for some. The
bill provided retroactive aid to those whose checks were cut off
when benefits expired June 2, while extending through November a
program offering up to 99 weeks of assistance.  Job Churning  In the 12 months ended in August, the economy created about
100,000 jobs, reflecting 50.2 million hires compared with 50.1
million separations, today’s report showed.  Companies planning to expand staff include  Toys ‘R’ Us
Inc. , the world’s biggest toy retailer. The Wayne, New Jersey-
based company said Sept. 28 it plans to hire about 45,000
employees to cope with demand during the holiday season.  The move is “essentially doubling” the domestic workforce,
Wayne, the company said in a statement. About 10,000 of the
positions will be available at the company’s 600 or so Toys ‘R’
Us Express temporary stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
