Italy may miss its deficit targets
this year and next should economic growth fall short of the
government’s “optimistic” forecasts, Bank of Italy Director
General  Fabrizio Saccomanni  said.  “The macroeconomic picture remains difficult as the
recovery shows signs of weakness,” he told a parliamentary
panel in Rome yesterday, according to an e-mailed  transcript 
from the central bank. As the government’s projection for 2010
growth “looks slightly optimistic,” it may be “harder” to
achieve the government’s goal of cutting the budget deficit to 5
percent of output this year and 3.9 percent next, he said.  The Finance Ministry  said  on Sept. 29 that  gross domestic
product  will expand 1.2 percent in 2010, up from the 1 percent
it  predicted  on May 6. The euro region’s third-largest  economy 
will grow 1.3 percent next year, down from a previous forecast
of 1.5 percent, the ministry said.  Italy emerged in the third quarter of 2009 from its worst
recession since World War II. The economy expanded 0.5 percent
in the three months through June as exports more than offset
flat  consumer spending . Italy will be the only Group of Seven
nation to contract in the third quarter, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said in a Sept. 9 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
