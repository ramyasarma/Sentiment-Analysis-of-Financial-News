Toshiba Corp. , a Japanese electronics
maker, settled a patent-infringement fight with contract
manufacturer  Wistron Corp.  over technology used in notebook
computers, legal filings show.  Each agreed to license the other’s patents, and Wistron
will make a payment of an unspecified amount to Tokyo-based
Toshiba, according to a redacted copy of the settlement
agreement filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission in
Washington. The companies also submitted a filing seeking
dismissal of a civil suit in federal court in California.  Toshiba, which said it sold the world’s first notebook
computer in 1985, claimed Wistron was infringing its patents.
Wistron countered that Toshiba was violating its patents. In the
ITC case, Toshiba sought to block imports of Wistron computers,
including the Acer Aspire 4810T notebook computer made by
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based Wistron for  Acer Inc.   The ITC case is In the Matter of Notebook Computer
Products, 337-705, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington). The civil case is Toshiba Corp. v. Wistron Corp.,
10cv74, U.S. District Court for the Central District of
California (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
