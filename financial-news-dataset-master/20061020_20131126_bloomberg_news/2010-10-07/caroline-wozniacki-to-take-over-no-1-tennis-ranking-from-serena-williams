Caroline Wozniacki  will take over the
No. 1 ranking in women’s tennis from an injured  Serena Williams 
after advancing to the quarterfinals at the  China Open  today.  Wozniacki’s 6-3, 6-2 defeat of  Petra Kvitova  of the Czech
Republic in the third round in Beijing means the 20-year-old
from Denmark will be No. 1 for the first time when the WTA Tour
rankings are published Oct. 11.  Wozniacki is currently No. 2. The 29-year-old Williams
hasn’t played on the women’s tour since capturing her 13th Grand
Slam title at  Wimbledon  in July. The American had foot surgery
the same month after walking through glass at a restaurant in
Munich, she told  USA Today  in September.  Wozniacki, a finalist in last year’s U.S. Open, won the
 Toray Pan Pacific Open  in Tokyo last week for a WTA Tour record
fifth tournament victory this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
