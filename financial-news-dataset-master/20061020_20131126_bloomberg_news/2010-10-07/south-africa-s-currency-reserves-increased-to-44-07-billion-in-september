South Africa’s gross reserves climbed
2.2 percent in September as the gold price rose and a weaker
dollar boosted the value of euro, pounds and other currency
holdings, the central bank said.  Gold and foreign currency  reserves  increased to $44.07
billion from $43.1 billion in August, the Pretoria-based Reserve
Bank said on its website today. Net reserves jumped 4.3 percent
to $40.85 billion on an increase in longer-term foreign exchange
swaps.  The dollar fell in September against all of the 16 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, falling 7.3 percent against the
euro. The gold price rose to $1,312.08 an ounce at the end of
September from $1,237.70 a month earlier, according to the
central bank.  South Africa’s Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  and
Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan have pledged to continue
accumulating foreign currency to boost reserves and help stem
the rand’s 37 percent surge against the dollar since the start
of last year. Policy makers in Africa’s largest economy are
under pressure from unions and manufacturers to weaken the
currency, which they say is hurting export competitiveness.  Marcus said on Sept. 22 that measures to stem gains in the
rand are “hugely costly.” The central bank incurred a loss of
1.05 billion rand ($153 million) in the year through March,
trying to build foreign reserves as a means of halting the
rand’s advance.  Losses are incurred as the central bank issues domestic
bonds to mop up excess liquidity caused by selling rand for
dollars, a process known as sterilization.  Last month, the Treasury boosted its foreign currency
deposits, adding $122 million, compared with $36 million it
added in August, the central bank’s data shows.  The Reserve Bank will use longer term swaps to increase
reserves and stem the rand’s gains, Marcus said on Sept. 9. The
forward position rose to $1.12 billion in September from $504
million a month earlier, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
