PNE Wind AG  rose  the most in five
months in Frankfurt trading after a court dismissed legal action
against the German developer of wind parks.  The shares climbed as much as 9.6 percent, the most since
May 10, to 1.89 euros at 1 p.m. local time. The company is
valued at 86.4 million euros ($121 million).  The local court in Stade, Germany, dismissed a claim by SSP
Technology A/S regarding the sale of a stake in the Danish
manufacturer of rotor blades by PNE Wind, the company said in a
statement on PR Newswire. SSP Technology was claiming 54.3
million euros in damages.  To contact the reporters on this story:
