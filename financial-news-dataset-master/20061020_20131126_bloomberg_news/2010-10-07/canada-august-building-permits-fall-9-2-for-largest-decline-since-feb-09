Canadian  building permits  fell more
than four times as much as expected in August, as companies and
governments planned fewer new structures.  The total value of permits issues by municipalities
decreased 9.2 percent to C$5.75 billion ($5.69 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The decline was the
largest since February 2009, and exceeded the most pessimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists, which had
a median forecast of a 2 percent drop.  Building permits are likely to decline further as the
housing market cools and governments end stimulus spending put
in place during the recession to spur growth, said  Robert Kavcic , an economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.  “We know that over the next year or so, there’s going to
be a slowdown coming” for permits, said Kavcic. Housing starts
will slow to a pace between 170,000 and 175,000 units a year,
from the current 180,000 to 190,000 units pace, he said.  The Canadian dollar declined from a five-month high versus
its U.S. counterpart after the report. The currency traded at
C$1.0156 per U.S. dollar at 10:43 a.m. in Toronto, compared with
C$1.0111 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 98.47 U.S. cents.  Non-residential Decline  Permits for non-residential construction  tumbled 23 percent
in August to C$2.2 billion. The value of permits for
institutional buildings dropped 39 percent, as Ontario cut
intentions for hospitals and Quebec planned fewer schools, the
report said. Industrial buildings fell 12 percent, the third
straight monthly decline, led by factories in Ontario and
utilities in Alberta. Permits for commercial buildings also
declined 12 percent, as firms planned fewer hotels, office
buildings and laboratories.  Residential permits increased 2 percent to C$3.54 billion,
a 15 percent increase from the year-ago month, Statistics Canada
said. Permits for multiple-unit dwellings surged 13 percent in
August, while single-family home permits dropped 4.9 percent,
the report said.  Kavcic said the residential permits numbers support his
prediction that housing starts slowed to a pace of 180,000 units
in September from 183,300 in August. The September figure will
be released tomorrow at 8:15 a.m. New York time by the Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  The total value of building permits was 11 percent higher
than the year-ago month, the report said.  Statistics Canada also revised its estimate for July’s
decline to 3.8 percent from the originally reported 3.3 percent
drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
