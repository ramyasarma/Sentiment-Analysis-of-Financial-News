Measures introduced by Shanghai’s
government to rein in the property market are “more significant
than expected”, Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by Tony Tsang
wrote in a report dated yesterday.  “This in our view highlighted the strong determination of
the central government and local governments to cool down the
property market,” Tsang wrote. “Some bullish market
participants might have under-estimated the strength and
frequency of the government tightening measures.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
