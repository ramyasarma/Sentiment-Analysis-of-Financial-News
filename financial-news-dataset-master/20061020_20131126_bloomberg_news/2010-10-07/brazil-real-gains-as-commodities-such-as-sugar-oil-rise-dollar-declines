Brazil’s real rose as commodity
prices increased and the dollar dropped against currencies
worldwide amid growing expectations the Federal Reserve will
expand credit to sustain the U.S. recovery.  The real advanced 0.2 percent to 1.6753 per dollar at 9:38
a.m. New York time, from 1.6788 yesterday.  “The real’s increase is very much aligned with all the
other currencies,” said  Diego Donadio , Latin America strategist
at BNP Paribas in Sao Paulo, in a phone interview. “It’s not a
big surprise we are seeing commodities going up as a whole, and
the dollar losing ground also across the board.”  Raw sugar rose 4.6 percent to 24.65 cents a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Brazil is the world’s largest sugar
producer. Oil rose 1 percent to $84.06 per barrel.  The U.S. dollar fell to a 15-year low against the Japanese
yen, and the weakest in eight months against the euro.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 11.39 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
