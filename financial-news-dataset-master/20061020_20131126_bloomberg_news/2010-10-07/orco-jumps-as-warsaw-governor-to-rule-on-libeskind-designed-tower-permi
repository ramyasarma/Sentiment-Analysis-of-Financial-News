Orco Property Group SA  climbed the
most in more than a week on speculation the developer will be
allowed to resume its flagship Warsaw building project.  Orco  jumped 4.1 percent to 196.8 koruna at 3:04 p.m. in
Prague, heading for the biggest gain since Sept. 27. The
project, intended to give Warsaw an architectural icon, was
designed by Polish-born American  Daniel Libeskind , who won the
competition to rebuild the World Trade Center in New York.  “There may be some speculative trading going on” related
to Orco’s Zlota 44 project, said  Petr Bartek , a Prague-based
analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS. “The market generally expects
the ruling to be positive for Orco.”  The governor of the Warsaw province will make a decision on
the validity of the building permit today, Ivetta Bialy, a
spokeswoman for the governor’s office, said by phone.  The project was stalled by the financial crisis and by
protests from neighbors that led Polish authorities to suspend
the permit. Today’s ruling will determine whether work can
resume immediately.  Orco, which first received a final building permit for the
site in 2008, originally planned to complete the 192-meter (630-
foot) tower by the third quarter of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
