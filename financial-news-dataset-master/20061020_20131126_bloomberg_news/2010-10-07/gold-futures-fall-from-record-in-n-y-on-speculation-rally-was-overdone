Gold futures fell the most since July
on bets that the rally to a record for three straight days was
overdone.  The dollar halted a slump against the euro, damping the
appeal of precious metals as alternative investments. Earlier,
gold reached an all-time high of $1,366 an ounce, reaching a
record for the 14th time in the past month. The 14-day relative
strength-index, a gauge of price momentum, was above 70 since
Sept. 22, signaling prices were poised to fall.  “From a technical standpoint, there is no support for gold
at these prices,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of
Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Illinois.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $12.70, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,335 at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest drop since July 27. The metal has climbed 22
percent this year.  Gold for immediate delivery rose to a record $1,364.77
before retreating.  “The world has been looking for a correction, and it’s
going to be fast and ugly,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer
at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  Losses may be limited because some investors will make
purchases on bets the rally will resume, said  Adam Klopfenstein ,
a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Citigroup Forecast  Citigroup Inc. raised its forecast for the short and medium
terms to $1,450. The bank said stimulus measures by central
banks may reduce currency values.  The dollar fell to a 15-year low versus the yen on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy
to help boost the economy. The Bank of Japan this week lowered
its main benchmark rate to “virtually zero.”  “People are very uncomfortable being in any currency
market now,” Klopfenstein said. “This is a stairway-to-heaven
pattern for gold.”  Silver futures for December delivery fell 45.9 cents, or 2
percent, to $22.584 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $23.53,
the highest level since 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery declined $7, or 0.4
percent, to $1,705 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Palladium futures for December delivery dropped $2.55, or
0.4 percent, to $587.10 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached to
$606.25, the highest level since June 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
