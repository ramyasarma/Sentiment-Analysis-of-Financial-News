Applications for U.S. unemployment
benefits unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in
three months, indicating the labor market may be thawing.  Jobless claims  dropped by 11,000 to 445,000 in the week
ended Oct. 2, the fewest since July 10, Labor Department figures
showed today in Washington. The  median forecast  or 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 455,000 new claims last
week. The total number of people receiving unemployment
insurance decreased and those getting extended payments jumped.  Fewer dismissals signal companies are gaining confidence
sales will hold up in coming months, a necessary first step
toward gains in hiring that will help strengthen the economic
recovery. A report tomorrow may show the jobless rate rose in
September for a second month, indicating a rebound will take
time to develop and one reason why the Federal Reserve may ease
monetary policy.  “The trend is in the right direction, we’re making
progress, but the levels aren’t quite there yet to crack open
the champagne,” said  Sal Guatieri , a senior economist at BMO
Capital Markets in Toronto. “Companies are hiring but at a very
slow rate. The numbers raise hopes of a pickup in job growth in
October but a growth rate that remains subpar.”  Stocks dropped as lower commodity prices depressed mining
and energy shares. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2
percent to 1,158.06 at the 4 p.m. close in New York.  Borrowing Drops  Consumer borrowing fell in August as Americans trimmed
credit-card balances, showing consumers remained reluctant to
take on more debt as joblessness climbed, Fed data also showed
today.  Credit  declined by $3.34 billion after falling $4.09
billion in July. Credit-card debt decreased for the 24th
consecutive month.  Separate figures from the Labor Department showed  job
openings  in August increased 60,000 after rising 277,000 the
previous month.  Estimates for jobless claims in the Bloomberg survey ranged
from 440,000 to 470,000. The Labor Department revised the prior
week’s figure to 456,000 from 453,000.  The  four-week  moving average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, dropped to 455,750 last week from 458,750,
today’s report showed. It was the sixth consecutive decrease.  Benefit Rolls  The number of people  continuing  to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 48,000 in the week ended Sept. 25 to 4.46 million,
the lowest since June 26.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended and emergency benefits under
federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional
benefits and are now collecting  emergency  and extended payments
increased by about 257,000 to 5.14 million in the week ended
Sept. 18.  The steady decline in the four-week average for initial
claims indicates the jump in applications during August may have
been caused by improper filing from workers seeking to regain
emergency benefits, said  John Ryding  and Conrad DeQuadros. The
program was reinstated by Congress in late July after expiring
the previous month.  The downtrend “gives some support to our hunch that the
flare up in claims over the summer was not an indication of a
weakening labor market but a result of re-filers looking to get
back on the federal emergency claims program once the benefits
were reauthorized, Ryding and DeQuadros, economists at RDQ
Economics LLC in New York, said in a note to clients.  September Forecast  Private employers in September added 75,000 workers while
total payrolls were unchanged, according to a Bloomberg survey
before tomorrow’s Labor Department figures. The unemployment
rate may have increased to 9.7 percent last month.  The economy is a top issue for voters in the November
congressional elections, and polls show the public is
increasingly skeptical of President Barack Obama’s performance.  While some companies are still firing employees, others are
recalling workers.  American Airlines, the third largest U.S. airline, plans to
recall 545 flight attendants and 250 pilots to meet demand for
international flights as it begins it begins an alliance with
British Airways Plc and Spain’s Iberia.  The first 25 pilots will return to work mid-November and
about 30 furloughed pilots will be recalled monthly after that,
American, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based  AMR Corp. , said
yesterday in a statement. The first recall notices for flight
attendants will be issued this month to about 225 workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
