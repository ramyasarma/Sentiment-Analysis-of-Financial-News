Michael Page International Plc , the
U.K.’s second-largest recruitment company, said third-quarter
gross profit rose 37 percent, led by permanent placements and
growth in Asia and South America.  Third-quarter gross profit was 112.7 million pounds ($179
million), the London-based company said in a statement today.
Permanent placement gross profit gained 50 percent, to 87.8
million pounds, the company said.  U.K. recruiters are benefiting from improving economies in
emerging markets, with rival  Hays Plc  saying today net fees
gained 59 percent in its Asia-Pacific region. Michael Page has
opened offices in Hong Kong, Chile and two in Brazil since the
end of June, Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ingham  said.  “We’re still anxious about the strength of the recovery in
the U.K., Europe and North America,” Ingham said in a telephone
conference call. The company sees strong growth in markets such
as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Hong Kong, mainland China, Dubai
and Abu Dhabi, he said.  Michael Page dropped 15 pence, or 3.1 percent, to 463.4
pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The shares have
increased 22 percent so far this year, giving it a market value
of 1.5 billion pounds.  A KBC Peel Hunt analyst,  Henry Carver , lowered his
recommendation on the company to “hold” from “buy,” saying,
“strong performance continues, but it’s now in the price.”  The company expects to add about 300 jobs in the fourth
quarter, mostly in Asia, the Mideast, and Latin America, Ingham
said. It increased staff by 333 in the third quarter, to 4,193,
the company said.  Gross profit in Asia Pacific increased 88 percent in the
period to 20.3 million pounds, and in the Americas, 74 percent
to 14.8 million pounds, the company said.  In the U.K., gross profit rose by 21 percent to 33 million
pounds, with gains evenly distributed across the regions, Ingham
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
