Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA 
forecasts a decline in profit margins because of development
costs for a new range of generators that may boost wind-turbine
sales to 4 gigawatts in 2013. The stock fell 5.4 percent.  The manufacturer will increase investment to 250 million
euros ($348 million) next year from 150 million euros in 2010,
reducing its profit margin to about 4.5 percent from about 5
percent this year, Chief Executive Officer  Jorge Calvet  told
investors in London today.  The investment “has an initial impact on margins,” Calvet
said via webcast. “The industry outlook is bright but it is
definitely a different industry from the one we used to know.”  Calvet is bidding to reverse a 56 percent  drop  in Gamesa’s
shares this year after banks limited financing for its customers
developing European wind parks. Casa Grande Cartagena SL, the
investment company of Spain’s billionaire  Del Pino  family, sold
its 5.6 percent stake in the company last month.  Gamesa shares fell to 5.11 euros in Madrid today, posting
the biggest decline since July 30.  The company, which in July forecast about 2.5 gigawatts of
turbine sales this year, has orders for 791 megawatts of
turbines in 2011, according to an investor presentation.  Based in Zamudio near Bilbao in northern Spain, Gamesa last
month said it will triple investment in China by 2012 to about
130 million euros to meet demand in the world’s second-largest
economy. Gamesa agreed to supply 1.3 gigawatts of turbines to
Guangdong Nuclear Wind and Datang Renewable Power through 2013.  Brazil, Spain  The company also agreed on its first contract in Brazil
last month, with a deal to supply 129 turbines to nine wind
parks managed by Iberdrola SA, its biggest  shareholder .  Investment in new wind generators has slumped in Spain with
developers adding 0.727 gigawatts of new capacity in the first
half of this year compared with 2.459 gigawatts in 2009, the
Spanish Wind Industry Association said last month.  “Gamesa is our top pick,” analyst  Rupesh Madlani  of
Barclays Capital said yesterday. “They haven’t added as much
capacity as their competition and have the defensive wind farm
business. They should be the first to bounce back as capacity
utilization increases.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
