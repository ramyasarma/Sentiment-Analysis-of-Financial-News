Greek government offices are shut
today and flights in and out of the country have been canceled
as public workers strike to protest austerity measures three
days after the government unveiled additional spending cuts for
2011.  Government services are paralyzed, schools were closed and
public hospitals were operating with limited staff. Air traffic
controllers at the country’s biggest airports will walk off the
job from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. forcing the cancellation or
rescheduling of dozens of domestic and international flights.  ADEDY, which represents more than 700,000 civil servants,
will hold a protest rally at midday in central Athens before
marching to parliament.  “We have already lost 25 percent from our wallets,” Ilias
Dolgyras, a member of ADEDY’s executive council, said on state-
run NET TV yesterday. “Greek civil servants are the worst paid
in the euro-area countries.”  The 2011 draft budget unveiled on Oct. 4 includes 9.2
billion euros ($12.7 billion) of deficit-reduction measures,
equivalent to about 4 percent of gross domestic product. They
extend cuts in wages and allowances implemented this year to try
to lower the euro-region’s second-biggest budget deficit in
return for 110 billion euros in emergency loans that allowed
Greece to avoid default.  ADEDY announced on Oct. 4 that it would not take part 
in wage negotiations unless the government restores bonus 
payments that were part of the initial cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
