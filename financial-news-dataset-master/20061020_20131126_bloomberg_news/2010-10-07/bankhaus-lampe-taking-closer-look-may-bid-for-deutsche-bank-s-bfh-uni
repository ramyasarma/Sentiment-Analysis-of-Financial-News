Bankhaus Lampe , the German lender
controlled by the billionaire Oetker family, said it’s
considering bidding for BHF-Bank AG, the private-banking unit
being sold by  Deutsche Bank AG .  “We’re interested in taking a closer look at BHF-Bank,”
Bankhaus Lampe spokeswoman Sandra Herzenbruch said by telephone
today. The company is speaking with various partners, she said,
declining further comment. Bankhaus Lampe may bid with Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., according to the  Financial Times
Deutschland , which reported the plans earlier today.  Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank and KKR declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, said in September
it chose four bidders for due diligence of BHF-Bank, which it
acquired through the purchase of asset and wealth manager Sal.
Oppenheim.  Bielefeld-based Bankhaus Lampe, which has about 14 billion
euros ($20 billion) in assets under management, would gain
another 43 billion euros with the acquisition of BHF-Bank,
leapfrogging Germany’s four largest independent private banks
including  M.M. Warburg & Co.  and  B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co. ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Bank is seeking at least 600 million euros for the
BHF unit, which offers private banking, asset management and
investment banking, and Liechtenstein’s LGT Group is among the
bidders for the division, people with knowledge of the process
said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
