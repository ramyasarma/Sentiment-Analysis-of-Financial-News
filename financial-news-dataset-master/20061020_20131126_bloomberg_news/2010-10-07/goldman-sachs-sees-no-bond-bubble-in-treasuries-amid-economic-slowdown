U.S. and global bond markets are
“some distance” from a bubble after this year’s rally, in the
face of a slowdown in growth and the prospect of the Federal
Reserve buying more securities, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  “Conditioned on the current, relatively weak,
macroeconomic background and assuming that short-term policy
rates are ‘appropriate,’ our models suggest that the major bond
markets are some distance from being in a bubble,” London-based
analysts  Aqib Aslam  and  Michael Vaknin  said in a report dated
yesterday. While “Switzerland, Norway and Sweden stand out as
the most ‘expensive’ bond markets,” they’ve also not reached
the threshold Goldman uses to define a bubble, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
