Hungary sold bonds at the lowest
yield since June on optimism the ruling party’s victory in local
elections will boost efforts to cut next year’s deficit and
investments in the country increase.  The government today sold 56.4 billion forint ($289
million) in bonds maturing in 2014, 2016 and 2020 at an auction
and an extra non-competitive sale, according to results on the
debt management agency’s Bloomberg page. The average yield fell
as much as 40 basis points from the previous sale two weeks ago.  Investors are betting that Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
victory in local elections on Oct. 3 will give his government
the freedom to spell out concrete economic policies and budget
cuts after his government committed to fiscal restraint. Last
month, Volkswagen AG and General Motors Co. announced a total of
1.4 billion euros in investment in Hungary.  The revival of foreign direct investments “and politics
have been quite supportive for the forint recently, which in
turn is good for local rates,” Societe Generale SA strategist
 Esther Law  wrote in a note to clients before the auction. “We
see little reason for this momentum to turn in the near term.”  Hungary’s currency traded at 273.25 per euro at 1:50 p.m.
in Budapest from 270.93 yesterday. The forint has been the
world’s best-performing currency since Sept. 8, when the
Hungarian Cabinet committed to a deficit of no more than 3
percent of gross domestic product for next year.  Deficit Target  Orban previously sought to raise budget-deficit targets set
in a 20 billion-euro ($27.4 billion) bailout with the
International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2008.  The cost of protecting against non-payment on the country’s
bonds for five years in the credit default swaps market fell to
277.45 basis points yesterday, the lowest since June 2.  At the auction, the government raised the planned amount
from all three maturities. It sold 20 billion forint of bonds
due in 2014 at an average yield of 6.38 percent, compared with
6.78 percent at a sale on Sept. 23. It also sold 15 billion
forint of 2016 debt at an average yield of 6.51 percent versus
6.82 percent and 15 billion forint of the 2020 maturity at 6.66
percent, compared with 6.93 percent.  In the non-competitive sale, the government sold 3.7
billion forint of 2014 bonds and 2.8 billion forint of the 2016
debt. Bids at the first sale totaled 87.6 billion forint,
compared with 128 billion forint two weeks ago.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
