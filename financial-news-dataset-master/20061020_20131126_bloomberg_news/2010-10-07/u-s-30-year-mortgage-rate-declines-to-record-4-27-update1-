U.S. mortgage rates fell for a second
straight week to the lowest on record, as unemployment hovering
near a 26-year high depresses home sales.  Rates for  30-year  mortgages declined to 4.27 percent in the
week ended today from 4.32 percent, Freddie Mac said in a
statement. It’s the lowest rate since the McLean, Virginia-based
mortgage-finance company began tracking the data in 1971. The
average 15-year  rate  was 3.72 percent.  Low borrowing costs have done little to spur home buying
with the U.S. jobless rate at 9.6 percent. Sales of existing
houses were the second-lowest on record in August, the National
Association of Realtors in Washington said Sept. 23.  “You’re going to get some people enticed to buy new
homes,” said  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond James &
Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida. “But people are
still a bit shell-shocked by the downturn in prices and they’re
going to be a lot more careful than they were before.”  Home sales have been depressed since the end of a federal
homebuyer tax credit in April. The Mortgage Bankers
Association’s index of mortgage applications declined for the
fifth straight week in the period ended Oct. 1, the Washington-
based group said Oct. 6. Loan refinancing fell 2.5 percent to an
eight-week low.  Home prices rose 3.2 percent in July from a year earlier,
the smallest gain since March, according to a report from
S&P/Case-Shiller released Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
