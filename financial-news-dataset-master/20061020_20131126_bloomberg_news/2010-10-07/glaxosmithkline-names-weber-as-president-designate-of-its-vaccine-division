GlaxoSmithKline Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest drugmaker, appointed  Christophe Weber  as president
designate of the company’s vaccine unit as  Jean Stephenne , the
current head of the division, prepares to retire.  Weber, currently a senior vice president and regional
director for Asia-Pacific, will start his new job on Jan. 1,
spokeswoman  Claire Brough  said in an e-mailed statement.  Glaxo, based in London, said March 12 its research and
development chief,  Moncef Slaoui , would take over as head of
vaccines and biological products from Stephenne in two years’
time. Weber, who will have operational responsibility of the
division, will report to Stephenne initially and to Slaoui after
Stephenne retires, the company said today.  Glaxo is boosting investment in bio-engineered drugs, or
medicines made from living cells, to take advantage of their
higher sales margins and complex manufacturing processes that
shield the therapies from generic rivals. Vaccine sales gained
30 percent to 3.71 billion pounds ($5.91 billion) last year,
boosted by shots to protect against swine flu.  Weber has been with Glaxo for more than 17 years, the U.K.
drugmaker said today. He served as chairman and chief executive
officer of GlaxoSmithKline France between 2003 and 2008 before
assuming his current role, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
