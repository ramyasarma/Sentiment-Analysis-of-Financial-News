Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said they agreed to
more than double trade between their countries to $100 billion
within five years.  “China’s economic growth is an extraordinary phenomenon
that we should take advantage of,” Berlusconi said at a joint
news conference with Wen in Rome today.  Italian companies such as scooter maker  Piaggio & C. SpA 
and carmaker Fiat SpA are increasingly focusing on sales and
production in China. Trade between the countries will reach $40
billion by the end of 2010, Deputy Industry Minister  Adolfo Urso 
said today after 10 commercial agreements valued at 2.25 billion
euros ($3 billion) were signed.  Wen said he hopes Italy will increase its investments in
China. Italy is currently investing $5 billion on 6,000 projects
in China compared with U.S. investments of more than $60 billion
and $50 billion by European countries as a whole, he said.  China will seek to ensure that foreign companies operating
in the country are treated the same as local ones, and China
will boost efforts to protect intellectual property, Wen said.  China is strategically “vital” for many Italian
companies,  Emma Marcegaglia , head of Italian employers’ lobby
Confindustria, said today. The two countries can cooperate in
several areas including technology, tourism, renewable energy
and manufacturing, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
