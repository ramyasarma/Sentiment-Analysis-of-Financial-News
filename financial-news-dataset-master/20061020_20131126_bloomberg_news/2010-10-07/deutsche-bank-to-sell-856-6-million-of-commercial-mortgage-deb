Deutsche Bank AG is marketing $856.6
million in bonds backed by commercial mortgages in the eighth
sale of the debt this year as Wall Street revives issuance.  The securities are tied to 42 loans secured by 63
properties, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Malls and shopping-center properties make up 43.1 percent of the
pool, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren’t public.  Banks are seeking to revive the $700 billion commercial-
mortgage backed bond market as yield-starved investors seek an
alternative to investment-grade corporate debt yielding 3.59
percent, the lowest since at least 1986, according to the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. today sold $1.1 billion of the debt in
the largest sale this year.  About $4.7 billion of bonds backed by commercial property
loans have sold since Jan. 1, up from $3.4 billion last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales tumbled 95
percent to $11.2 billion in 2008 from a record $234 billion in
2007.  Issuance may reach $35 billion in 2011, Standard & Poor’s
said in a Sept. 30 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
