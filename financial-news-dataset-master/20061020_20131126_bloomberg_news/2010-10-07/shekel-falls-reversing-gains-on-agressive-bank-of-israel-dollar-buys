The Bank of Israel bought dollars,
weakening the shekel, after the currency strengthened to the
highest level in two years as the dollar extended its slide
against currencies worldwide.  The central bank purchased more than $500 million, said
 Doron Levi , head of the dealing room at Mizrahi Tefahot Bank
Ltd.  The shekel, which reversed earlier gains to fall as much as
0.6 percent to 3.6078 per dollar, was little changed at 3.5877
at 5:52 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  “Looks like today’s intervention is more aggressive than
it’s been in a while,” said  Lior Faust,  foreign banks and hedge
funds relationship manager at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. in Tel
Aviv, the country’s largest bank by assets. “It looks like they
wanted to make a stand.”  Central bank Governor  Stanley Fischer  has been buying
foreign currency since March 2008 in an attempt to curb shekel
gains and help an economy that relies on exports for almost half
its gross domestic product. The bank bought $699 million dollars
last month helping to boost foreign currency reserves to a
record $66.3 billion in September, it said today.  Earlier the shekel rose as much as 0.7 percent to 3.5623,
tracking a decline in the dollar to a 15-year low against the
yen amid growing expectations the Federal Reserve will expand
credit easing to sustain the U.S. recovery. The euro touched a
more than eight-month high against the greenback as yields on
benchmark Treasury securities traded near the least since
January 2009 before data forecast to show a worsening U.S. labor
market.  Nothing to Do  Bank of Israel dollar purchases can’t influence the long-
term shekel exchange rate as the U.S. currency weakens globally,
said  Leonor Terkieltaub , head of the foreign-currency department
at Tel Aviv-based IBI. It may strengthen to as high as 3.2 per
dollar if the greenback’s global drop continues unabated, she
said.  “There’s nothing he can do about a dollar that is heading
back to Lehman crisis levels,” Terkieltaub said today by
telephone. “The best he can do is keep the shekel gains
moderate.”  The shekel has gained 5.3 percent over the past month to
the highest since October 2008, a month after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which deepened the global credit
crisis.  Government bonds rose with the yield on the benchmark 5
percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due in January 2020 falling 3 basis
point to 4.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
