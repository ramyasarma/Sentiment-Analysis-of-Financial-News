Sugar futures may rise on concern
that dry weather and port delays will curb shipments from
Brazil, the world’s biggest producer, according to a survey.  Five of 10 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar traded in New York will advance
next week. Four predicted a drop and one estimated little
change. The price rose 6.9 percent to 25.16 cents a pound
yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest gain in
almost two years.  “The problem is the largest origin, Brazil, is reluctant
to sell,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge
USA in New York, said yesterday in a report. “The supply
situation will be tight.”  Five of 10 survey respondents said refined sugar on NYSE
Liffe in London will gain, three forecast a drop and two
predicted little change. Refined sugar advanced 4.8 percent this
week to $649.80 a metric ton yesterday.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener will probably
widen, according to four of 10 people surveyed. Three estimated
the spread will narrow, and three predicted no change.  In the attached chart, red bars are derived by subtracting
bearish forecasts from bullish estimates for raw sugar, with
readings above zero signaling that most respondents expect
higher prices. The green line shows raw-sugar prices, and the
blue line shows white sugar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
