Accelerating Czech industrial output
may not prompt the central bank to increase interest rates this
year as the government’s fiscal austerity measures help keep a
lid on consumer demand and inflation.  Industrial  output  rose an annual 12.9 percent in August,
the second fastest increase in 2010, the Prague-based Statistics
Office said in a statement today. The foreign  trade  surplus
narrowed to the smallest in 20 months in August as economic
growth fuelled demand for imports, the office said.  The Czech economy, where exports account for about 70
percent of  gross domestic product , is recovering from its
deepest recession since the fall of communism 20 years ago. GDP
grew an annual 2.4 percent in the three months through June, the
fastest pace in eight quarters. The Finance Ministry on July 15
raised its 2010 growth forecast to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent
on expectations of stronger exports.  “Czech industry reported quite fantastic results for
August, not only with regard to output or sales but particularly
regarding new orders,”  Radomir Jac , chief analyst at Generali
PPF Asset Management in Prague, said. Industrial sales rose 14.4
percent in nominal terms in August, while new orders were up
22.1 percent, the statistics office said.  First Vote  The Ceska Narodni Banka left the benchmark two-week
repurchase rate at a record-low 0.75 percent for a third meeting
on Sept. 23, keeping borrowing costs a quarter-point lower than
the  European Central Bank’s  main rate.  Board member  Eva Zamrazilova  cast the first vote for a rate
increase at the September meeting after two years of cuts, when
the central bank reduced the main rate by 3 percentage points to
counter the impact of the recession.  “In my view, if exports and overall economic growth remain
stronger than expected, they will, in the end, serve as an
argument for higher interest rates in monetary policy debates,”
said Jac. “However, I believe that the first really serious
debate on need of higher interest rates may come only at
December meeting.”  Retail sales rose 2.8 percent annually in August, after a 1
percent decline in the previous month, with the rebound driven
by car sales, the office said in a separate statement today.  Persistent “high  unemployment”  and budget spending cuts
will probably help limit consumer spending and keep inflation in
check, said  Miroslav Frayer , an analyst at Komercni Banka AS,
the Czech unit of Societe Generale Group.  Inflation was 1.9 percent in August, unchanged from a 16-
month high in July. The central bank sees headline inflation
exceeding its 2 percent target this year before dropping to 1.9
percent in the third and fourth quarters of 2011. The jobless
rate fell to 8.6 percent in August, from a six-year high of 9.9
percent in February  “The normalization” of interest rates “toward neutral
levels” should begin at the end of the first quarter of next
year of at the beginning of the second quarter, Komercni’s
Frayer said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
