(Corrects default rate in sixth paragraph of story
published yesterday.)  The global speculative-grade default
rate was 4 percent at the end of September, the lowest in almost
two years, declining from 6.2 percent at the end of the previous
quarter, according to  Moody’s Investors Service .  Forty companies rated by Moody’s defaulted this year, of
which 13 were in the third quarter, down from the 237 issuers
that failed to meet their obligations through September 2009,
the New York-based ratings firm said in its monthly default
report. The default rate is expected to fall to 2.7 percent by
the end of 2010, and 2 percent by the third quarter of 2011,
according to Moody’s.  “Our default expectations remain stable,”  Albert Metz ,
Moody’s director of credit policy research, said in the report.
“Of course, risks remain. But for several months now, realized
defaults have been coming in a little below our expectations.”  Relative yields on high-yield debt have declined as
investor confidence in the strength of corporate balance sheets
increased since the middle of the year, and now stand at about
610 basis points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
Global High Yield Index. Spreads were as wide as 746 basis
points in June, down from 21.93 percentage points in December
2008 after the demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Eight of last quarter’s defaulters were in the U.S.,
including  Radio One Inc. , which missed interest payments on $200
million of debt, Moody’s said. In the U.S., the speculative-
grade default rate ended the third quarter at 4.0 percent and
the ratings firm said it will drop to 2.8 percent by year-end
and to 2.2 percent in a year’s time.  In Europe, where high-yield spreads are the lowest since
June 2008, the default rate was 3.5 percent in the third
quarter, down from 5.6 percent in the second, Moody’s said. The
ratings firm predicts the default rate in Europe will drop to
2.2 percent at the end of the year and then to 1.3 percent by
September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
