Rubber futures on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange may climb to the highest level since July 2008 because
of “bullish momentum,” according to technical analysis from
Singapore-based broker Phillip Futures Pte Ltd.  The moving average convergence/divergence indicator crossed
above the shorter-dated signal line on Sept. 22, pointing to
higher prices, said  Ker Chung Yang , analyst at Phillip Futures.  The most-active contract, which increased 17 percent this
year, may test resistance at 332 yen per kilogram ($4,006 per
metric ton) next week, Ker said in e-mail yesterday. “It’s
possible for TOCOM rubber to extend gains,” he said. The price
reached 324.1 yen yesterday, the highest intraday level since
April, and traded at 323.6 yen today.  Rubber, used to make tires and gloves, may be bolstered by
strengthening crude oil prices and increasing demand for tires
after U.S. auto sales in September rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 11.8 million, compared with 9.4 million a year
earlier, according to a Phillip Futures’ note dated Oct. 4.
Demand in China, the world’s biggest consumer, may outstrip
supply in the short term because of economic growth, it said.  The MACD indicator is derived by subtracting a 26-day
exponential moving average from a 12-day average. A second
measure, called the signal line, uses a nine-day moving average
of the MACD indicator. In technical analysis, investors and
analysts study charts of trading patterns and prices to predict
changes in a security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on the story:
