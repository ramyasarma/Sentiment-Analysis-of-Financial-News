European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said he supports a “strong dollar” and opposes
“disorderly” shifts in global exchange rates.  “I share the view of the U.S. authorities when they
reiterate that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United
States of America,” he said at a press conference in Frankfurt
today.  Asked whether he’s concerned about the euro’s recent
appreciation against the dollar, Trichet said: “I would only
say that, more than ever, exchange rates should reflect economic
fundamentals.”  “Excess volatility and disorderly moves have adverse
implications for economic and financial stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
