Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the
U.K.’s largest government-owned bank, hired  George Mavridoglou 
from Mizuho Investment Management U.K. Ltd. as it expands its
loan-trading business.  Mavridoglou joined RBS as a London-based director,
reporting to  Sam Griffiths , managing director and head of
European high-yield trading, according to Claire Gorman, a
spokeswoman at the Edinburgh-based bank.  Mavridoglou was previously a portfolio manager with Mizuho
Investment, where he oversaw the collateralized loan obligation
franchise, RBS said.  3i Group Plc, Europe’s biggest publicly traded private
equity firm, last month agreed to buy Mizuho Investment for 18.3
million pounds ($29 million) to expand its investments in
corporate debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
