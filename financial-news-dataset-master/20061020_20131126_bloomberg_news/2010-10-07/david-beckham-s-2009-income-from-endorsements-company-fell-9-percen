David Beckham’s  income from
endorsements dropped 9.4 percent last year according to the
accounts of his London-based company Footwork Productions Ltd.  The Los Angeles Galaxy and former England soccer player
earned 9.03 million pounds ($14.4 million) in the year to Dec.
31, 2009, as the highest-paid director of Footwork. Beckham made
9.97 million pounds the year before.  “The directors are satisfied with the results for the
year,” the company said in a statement in the accounts that
were posted at Companies House.  Revenue declined 6 percent to 11.36 million pounds, and
profit for the year fell to 15,382 pounds from 815,733 after the
drop of 700,000 pounds in sales.  Footwork gets income from Beckham’s endorsements with
companies including Adidas AG.  Beckham Brand Ltd., the company created to exploit the
image rights of Beckham and his wife Victoria, in January posted
a 60 percent increase in profit after his first season with the
Los Angeles Galaxy.  The image-rights business, which is jointly controlled by
Beckham, his wife and management company 19 Entertainment,
tallies the income from the midfielder’s revenue share agreement
with Galaxy and deals like the one his family has with Coty
Inc., the world’s largest fragrance company.  Beckham Brand’s net income for the year ending Dec. 31,
2008, was 4 million pounds, the company said in an annual filing
to Companies House on Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
