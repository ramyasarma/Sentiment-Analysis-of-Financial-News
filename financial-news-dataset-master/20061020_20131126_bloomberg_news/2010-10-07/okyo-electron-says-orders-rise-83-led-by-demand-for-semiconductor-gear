Tokyo Electron Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest maker of semiconductor equipment, said orders for
chip and flat-panel manufacturing gear rose 83 percent in fiscal
second-quarter, helped by demand for non-memory chips.  Orders rose to 172 billion yen ($2.1 billion) in the three
months ended Sept. 30, from 93.8 billion yen a year earlier, the
Tokyo-based company said in a preliminary statement on its
 website  today. The company will announce final figures at its
earnings briefing on Nov. 2, it said.  Bookings of chipmaking gear rose to 150 billion yen in the
quarter, from 79.6 billion yen a year earlier, the company said.
Orders of flat-panel manufacturing gear jumped to 22 billion yen
from 14.2 billion yen, it said.  Tokyo Electron  added 0.3 percent to close at 4,670 yen on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The shares have dropped 21
percent this year, worse than the 8.2 percent decline by the
