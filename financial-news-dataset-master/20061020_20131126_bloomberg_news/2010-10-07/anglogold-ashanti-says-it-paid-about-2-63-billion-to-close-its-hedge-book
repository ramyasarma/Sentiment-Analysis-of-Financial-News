AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the world’s
third-largest producer of the precious metal, eliminated the
last of its hedge book at a cost of $2.63 billion to give it
full exposure to gold prices that climbed to a record today.  “This is a milestone day for us,”  Mark Cutifani , chief
executive officer of Johannesburg-based AngloGold, told
reporters on a conference call today after canceling commitments
to sell 2.7 million ounces at below-market prices. The company
“expects to enhance cash flow and profit margins as a result,”
it said in a statement.  AngloGold, held 12 percent by hedge-fund firm Paulson &
Co., is taking advantage of prices that are rising for a 10th
straight year to eliminate so-called forward-sales agreements at
lower levels.  Barrick Gold Corp. , the world’s biggest producer
of the metal, spent almost $5 billion last year to cancel such
hedges against the risk of prices declining.  Eliminating hedged sales will likely increase free cash
flow by “around 4.6 rand a share, or 1.8 billion rand ($260
million) on average per annum over the next five years,” Credit
Suisse Standard Securities Ltd. said in an Oct. 4 note, adding
the benefit should accrue from next year.  AngloGold last month raised about $1.6 billion and said it
would use the proceeds, along with its own cash and existing
credit facilities, to eliminate its remaining gold hedge
position by early 2011.  Early Termination  Prices have been stronger than anticipated, allowing the
company to cancel contracts earlier, Cutifani said. AngloGold’s
timing of cancellations since 2008 has given shareholders a $4
billion benefit, he said. That’s the difference between the $10
billion it would have cost AngloGold to cancel the forward sales
today, and the actual $6 billion it cost the company since 2008.  AngloGold’s hedge book reached a peak of 17.8 million
ounces in December 2000 when the metal traded at about $273 an
ounce, Credit Suisse said. The company reported losses of about
$3.2 billion over the past 14 years as the spot price of gold
overtook the price at which the company had agreed to sell the
metal, it said.  AngloGold paid an average $1,300 an ounce to cancel the
last contracts, Cutifani said today. While that’s above its
expected range of $1,250 to $1,280 an ounce, “we’ll get that
cash back real quick because the gold price is trading well
north of where we thought it would be in that period,” he said.  Gold has gained 23 percent this year to a record $1,364.77
an ounce in London today. Investors often switch funds from
currencies and equities into gold in times of uncertainty,
hoping the metal will be a safer bet.  The gold market has been “very strong” and estimates by
others of a price from $1,200 to $1,500 an ounce seem
“sensible,” Cutifani said, without making his own forecast.  Shares  in AngloGold declined for a second day, dropping 1.1
percent to 319.85 rand by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg,
giving it a market value of 121.9 billion rand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
