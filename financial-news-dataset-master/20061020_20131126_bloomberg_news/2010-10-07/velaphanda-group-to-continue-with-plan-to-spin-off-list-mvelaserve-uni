Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. , the South
African investment company started by former anti-apartheid
guerilla Tokyo Sexwale, said it will continue with its plan to
spin off its Mvelaserve Ltd. unit.  The shares of Mvelaserve, which provides a range of
outsourced services such as security, facilities management,
catering and cleaning, will be traded on Johannesburg’s stock
exchange before the end of the year, Mvela Group, based in the
city, said in a statement today.  While it doesn’t need to raise funding, listing its shares
will give Mvelaserve a “further source of capital to facilitate
future expansion if required,” Mvelaserve Chief Executive
Officer Jorge Ferreira said in the statement.  The spinoff of Mvelaserve follows Mvela Group’s unbundling
of its holding in  Life Healthcare Group Holdings Ltd. , which was
listed on the Johannesburg bourse on June 1. Mvelaserve posted a
12 percent increase in revenue in the year through June to 4.2
billion rand ($612 million) and a 31 percent advance in earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, it said.  Sexwale resigned as chairman of Mvela Group after he was
appointed as South African human settlements minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
