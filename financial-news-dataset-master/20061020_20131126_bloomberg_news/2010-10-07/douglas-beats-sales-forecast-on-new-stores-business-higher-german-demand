Douglas Holding AG , Europe’s largest
retailer of makeup and perfumes, beat its own and analysts’
full-year  sales  predictions as new stores attracted customers
and Germans bought more fragrances, jewelry and books.  Revenue in the 12 months through September rose 3.7 percent
to 3.32 billion euros ($4.64 billion) from 3.2 billion euros a
year earlier, the Hagen, Germany-based company said today in a
 statement . The increase exceeded Douglas’s forecast of an
increase at the upper end of a 0 percent-to-2 percent range.
Sales topped the 3.27 billion-euro  average estimate  of 19
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Germany’s retail sales will rise about 1.5 percent this
year after the  recession  led to a revenue decline of 2 percent
in 2009, the Berlin-based HDE industry group said last month,
raising the forecast from an outlook for no revenue growth. The
country’s economy expanded at a record pace in the second
quarter and unemployment continued to decline in September.  The company “has built a good foundation for the important
Christmas business” in December,  Christoph Schlienkamp , an
analyst at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, Germany, with a “hold”
 recommendation  on the stock, said in a phone interview.  Douglas rose as much as 30 cents, or 0.8 percent, to 37.69
euros, the highest intraday price since Jan. 8, 2008, and was up
0.1 percent as of 9:52 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The  stock  has
gained 10 percent in 2010, valuing the company at
1.47 billion euros.  Same-Store Sales  Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.4 percent.
Douglas’s domestic market accounted for about 65 percent of
 revenue , and sales in Germany increased 4.6 percent compared
with 2 percent growth abroad. The retailer, which operates
stores in 21 countries, said full-year pretax profit  was
probably  at the “upper end” of its forecast range of 120
million euros to 130 million euros. The company is scheduled to
report full earnings figures on Jan. 12.  Perfume and cosmetics sales rose 1.3 percent to 1.88
billion euros, advancing 2.9 percent in Germany while dropping
0.3 percent in other markets. Jewelry revenue increased 6.1
percent to 310 million euros while revenue at Douglas’s Thalia
bookstore chain gained 10 percent to 905 million euros,
propelled by the unit taking a majority stake in buch.de, an
online service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
