Orange-juice futures rose as traders
bought contracts to cover short positions, or bets on falling
prices, in advance of a U.S. government forecast for the citrus
crop in Florida, the world’s second biggest.  The average estimate of six analysts in Bloomberg News
survey is for an orange crop of 150.7 million boxes in the
harvest that’s just getting under way, up 13 percent from the
previous season. A U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast at
that level would be “neutral to bearish,” said  Sterling Smith ,
an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in St. Paul, Minnesota.  “We do have the potential to maybe rally a little bit
more,” Smith said. A jump in prices would be “short-covering
driven,” he said.  Orange juice for November delivery advanced 1.1 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $1.5155 a pound at 1:18 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Yesterday, prices plunged 5.1 percent, the most
since July 8.  The crop that Florida growers finished collecting in June
totaled 133.6 million boxes, the second-smallest in two decades,
after a freeze in January harmed fruit. A box weighs 90 pounds,
or 41 kilograms. The decline helped send futures up 61 percent
in the past year.  Brazil is the world’s biggest producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
