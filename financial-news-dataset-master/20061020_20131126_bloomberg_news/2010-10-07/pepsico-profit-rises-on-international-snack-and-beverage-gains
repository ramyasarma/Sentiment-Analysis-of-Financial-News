PepsiCo Inc.  lowered the top end of
its annual profit forecast as Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  increases marketing spending in China and North America.  PepsiCo said today that per-share profit, excluding some
items, will climb as much as 11 percent this year, compared with
a previous maximum of 12 percent. That’s about $4.12 a share,
short of the $4.16 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  PepsiCo is spending more on projects such as adding drink
coolers in China and creating new products in North America,
Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said during a call with
reporters. The spending is on top of the 10 cents a share
PepsiCo, the world’s largest snack maker, pledged to invest in
such programs in March.  “That’s what’s bringing down the guidance range, and
that’s fine,”  Jack Russo , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. in
St. Louis, said today in a telephone interview. “They are very
well positioned overseas and they are in all these markets,
China and India, that are growing.” He recommends buying the
shares.  PepsiCo also cited unfavorable foreign-exchange rates for
the change in forecast. Sales in Europe climbed 47 percent last
quarter, a growth rate second only to the American beverages
unit, where revenue doubled after PepsiCo acquired two bottlers.  PepsiCo dropped $2.01, or 3 percent, to $66.10 at 4:01 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the largest
decline since June. The shares have gained 8.7 percent this
year, compared with a 4.3 percent increase for Coca-Cola Co.  Sales Performance  PepsiCo’s  sales  rose 40 percent to $15.5 billion in the
third quarter. The Latin America Foods, PepsiCo Americas
Beverages and European units all posted sales gains as Nooyi
pushed versions of Doritos and juices tailored to local tastes.  Net income rose to $1.92 billion, or $1.19 a share.
Excluding some items, third-quarter profit was $1.22, matching
the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. A year earlier,
profit at Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo amounted to $1.72
billion, or $1.09.  PepsiCo reiterated that the acquisition of its two largest
bottlers, completed in March, will cost $650 million and
generate $400 million in annual savings by 2012. The move helped
more than double  sales  in the PepsiCo Americas beverage unit to
$5.79 billion, the company’s biggest business last quarter.  PepsiCo got a head start on Coca-Cola in taking control of
its U.S. distribution system. Atlanta-based  Coca-Cola  closed the
purchase of the North American operations of its largest bottler
this week. Both companies expect to boost revenue by
streamlining sales forces and marketing various types of
products together, such as chips and drinks for PepsiCo.  The company also said today that it’s creating a global
nutrition group to develop more products with fruits,
vegetables, grains and dairy. Consumer-food companies are
overhauling products to make them healthier as consumers demand
less salt, fat and artificial ingredients. PepsiCo’s chief
scientific officer,  Mehmood Khan , will run the division, which
will be based in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
