Washington Mutual Inc.  said its
revised reorganization plan calls for $7 billion in creditor
distributions and incorporates an amended settlement with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.   The parties agreed to modify an earlier  settlement  to
address changes that have occurred since it was reached,
including the appointment of an examiner and an agreement with
some of the company’s creditors, Seattle-based Washington Mutual
said yesterday in a statement distributed by PRNewswire.  A hearing on approval of the disclosure statement that was
filed with the amended reorganization plan is scheduled for
Oct. 18 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware,
according to the statement.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Mary F. Walrath  in July agreed that
an examiner should be appointed to review WaMu’s assets,
including the value of potential lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase
and the FDIC over their role in the 2008 collapse of Washington
Mutual Bank.  Shareholders claim that lawsuits related to the bank’s
failure might bring in $30 billion, a figure disputed by the
FDIC, WaMu and its creditors.  WaMu filed for  bankruptcy  Sept. 26, 2008, the day after its
banking unit was taken over by regulators and sold to JPMorgan
for $1.9 billion. Before it failed, Washington Mutual Bank had
more than 2,200 branches and $188 billion in deposits.  The case is In Re Washington Mutual Inc., 08-12229, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
