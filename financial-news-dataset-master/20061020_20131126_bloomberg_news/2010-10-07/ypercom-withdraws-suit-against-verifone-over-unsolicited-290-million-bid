Hypercom Corp. , a maker of
electronic-payment software, said it withdrew its Delaware
Chancery Court lawsuit against  VeriFone Systems Inc.  over
disclosure of VeriFone’s unsolicited $290 million bid.  Hypercom’s board rejected San Jose, California-based
VeriFone’s $5.25-a-share bid after the largest maker of
electronic-payment equipment made its offer public Sept. 24.
Hypercom claimed VeriFone violated a confidentiality agreement
between the companies.  “We filed a lawsuit to prevent VeriFone from making public
any of the confidential financial projections we shared with
VeriFone,” Hypercom Chairman  Norman Stout  said today in a
statement.  “VeriFone made a series of public statements that we
believe could be misconstrued by Hypercom’s stockholders,”
Stout said. “We therefore felt it necessary to withdraw our
litigation.”  The complaint was filed under seal Sept. 23 and made public
yesterday at the request of Bloomberg News.  VeriFone said in a statement that it would move ahead with
its bid.  ‘Without Merit’  “We’re pleased that Hypercom has withdrawn the litigation,
which we believe was wholly without merit and was designed to
keep Hypercom shareholders in the dark,” VeriFone said.  VeriFone, best known for having its credit-card payment
devices in New York City taxi cabs, wants Hypercom in order to
expand its European business, analysts say. The offer was 24
percent higher than Hypercom’s closing stock price on Sept. 23.  Hypercom  fell 5 cents to $6.24 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.  VeriFone  rose 45 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$27.85.  VeriFone executives first approached Scottsdale, Arizona-
based Hypercom about a merger in September 2009, according to
court filings. Hypercom agreed to discuss a buyout as long as
the talks remained confidential, it said in its suit.  Last month, VeriFone officials sent a letter to Hypercom
executives threatening to take their offer to Hypercom’s
shareholders, according to the suit. The letter came after
Hypercom rejected VeriFone’s earlier buyout bid.  If a judge allowed the offer to proceed, Hypercom’s
suppliers might have been persuaded to cut off the flow of
components needed to produce the company’s products or redirect
them to competitors, the company’s lawyers claimed.  The case is Hypercom Corp. v. VeriFone Systems Inc., 5845,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
