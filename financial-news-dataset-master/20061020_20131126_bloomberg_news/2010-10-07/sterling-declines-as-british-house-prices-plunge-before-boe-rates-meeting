The pound traded near a five-month
low against the euro after a report showed U.K. house prices
plunged by the most on record in September, fueling speculation
the central bank may consider restarting bond purchases.  Sterling pared losses against the European currency on a
report that showed manufacturing rose. The average cost of a
home fell 3.6 percent from August, Halifax, the mortgage-lending
division of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in a statement today.
The central bank will keep its main interest rate at a record
low and maintain asset purchases at 200 billion pounds ($318
billion), according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. One
economist from 36 polled predicted a 50 billion-pound increase.  “We don’t think there’s going to be additional
quantitative easing today, but it will be kept on the cards as
an option,” said  Lauren Rosborough , a senior strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in London. “Euro-sterling may be higher
going into the Bank of England decision.”  The pound traded at 87.70 pence per euro as of 10:17 a.m.
in London, from 87.66 yesterday and 88.05 pence earlier, the
weakest level since May 7. It strengthened to $1.5922 from
$1.5890 yesterday. Britain’s currency bought 131.40 yen from
131.78 yesterday.  The dollar slumped to a 15-year low against the yen today
amid growing expectations the Federal Reserve will expand credit
easing.  The median prediction of eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a drop of 0.2 percent in house prices. The
decline last month was the biggest since Halifax began its
housing gauge in 1983.  Output Boost  U.K. government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the 10-
year gilt 3 basis points higher to 2.92 percent. Two-year yields
also rose 3 basis points, to 0.65 percent.  Gilts have gained 10.1 percent since the end of 2009,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch unit. German government bonds earned 9.5 percent, while
U.S. Treasuries returned 9.3 percent, the indexes show.  Manufacturing  output increased 0.3 percent from the
previous month, when it gained a revised 0.4 percent, the Office
for National Statistics said today in London. The median
forecast of 28 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey  was for a
gain of 0.2 percent. On the year, production rose 6 percent, the
most since December 1994.  To contact the reporters on this story:
