Investment Dar Co., the Kuwait-based
owner of half of Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd., submitted a request
to the central bank to write off 500 million dinars ($1.8
billion), or half of its debts,  Al-Qabas  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Investment Dar’s creditors opposed the request in a letter
to the central bank, according to the newspaper.  An Investment Dar spokesman could not be reached for
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
