Most Asian  stocks  fell as  Samsung
Electronics Co.  reported profit that missed analyst estimates,
overshadowing gains by commodity-related companies after oil and
metal prices rose.  Samsung, Asia’s largest maker of semiconductors, fell 2.9
percent in Seoul, dragging down chip shares.  Canon Inc. , a
camera maker that gets more than a quarter of its sales in the
Americas, lost 1.3 percent in Tokyo after U.S. companies cut
jobs last month, raising concern the economic recovery will slow.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company, gained 1
percent in Sydney. STX Pan Ocean Co., South Korea’s No. 1 bulk
carrier, jumped 9.1 percent after shipping rates rose.  Surges in Japan’s and Australia’s currencies drove the
U.S.-dollar denominated  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  up 0.5 percent
to 130.70 as of 5:20 p.m. in Tokyo. About seven shares declined
for every six that advanced. The gauge was headed to its highest
level since August 2008, before the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  “Sentiment is fairly mixed,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-
based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages $85 billion. “Markets have priced in continuing
economic growth and continuing strength in profits, so whenever
something negative comes along that questions this, like Samsung,
it causes a bit of a setback.”  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  gained 0.1 percent, reversing
a 0.4 percent drop, and the country’s currency surged to a
record after a statistics bureau report showed Australian
employers added 49,500 workers in September from August. The
median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for an increase of 20,000. The jobless rate was 5.1 percent.  Indexes, Economies  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index and Taiwan’s Taiex index were little changed. South
Korea’s Kospi index fell 0.2 percent. China’s markets were
closed for a holiday this week and reopen tomorrow.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The index fell 0.1 percent yesterday from a five-month
high on Oct. 5 after figures from ADP Employer Services showed
companies in the U.S. cut 39,000 jobs last month. Economists had
forecast 20,000 would be added, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  The International Monetary Fund said yesterday after Asian
markets closed that high unemployment, public debt and fragile
banking systems pose risks to global prosperity, urging policy
makers to take bolder steps to ensure a sustained recovery.  The world economy will expand 4.2 percent next year, the
Washington-based IMF said, down from its forecast of 4.3 percent
three months ago. The fund projects growth of 4.8 percent this
year, up from 4.6 percent.  Technology Stocks  Technology-related companies fell the most today among the
10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Samsung
Electronics  lost 2.9 percent to 770,000 won in Seoul after
reporting third-quarter operating income of 4.8 trillion won
($4.3 billion), short of the 5.03 trillion won average estimate
from 11 analyst estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Concerns about the fourth quarter will get more
serious,” said  Kim Young Joon , an analyst at LIG Investment &
Securities Co. in Seoul. “It’s becoming increasingly certain
profitability from semiconductors will worsen and television
margins will stay bad because of prices.”  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. lost 0.9 percent in Seoul. Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest custom
maker of chips, fell 0.8 percent to NT$61.30 in Taipei.
Advantest Corp., the world’s largest maker of chip testers, sank
2 percent to 1,730 yen in Tokyo.  U.S. Data  Samsung was the heaviest drag on the MSCI index, followed
by Canon, which slipped 1.3 percent to 3,875 yen. In Sydney,
 James Hardie Industries SE , the biggest seller of home siding in
the U.S., fell 2.3 percent to A$5.66 and  ResMed Inc. , which
makes machines that regulate breathing and gets more than half
its sales in the U.S., dropped 2.3 percent to A$3.37.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has risen 20 percent from this
year’s low on May 25 and has gained 8 percent in 2010 on
speculation profit growth will weather Europe’s debt crisis,
China’s steps to curb property-price inflation and concern about
the pace of the U.S. recovery. Stocks in the gauge trade at 14.4
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.8 times
for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BHP rose 1 percent to A$40.95 in Sydney. PetroChina Co.,
the country’s biggest oil company, advanced 0.5 percent to
HK$9.55 in Hong Kong.  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s biggest trading
company, gained 0.4 percent to 2,029 yen in Tokyo.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for November delivery gained 0.5 percent
yesterday in New York, the highest settlement since May 3. The
 London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including aluminum and
copper rose 0.6 percent yesterday to the highest level since
July 2008.  STX Pan Ocean surged 9.1 percent to 13,150 won in Seoul.
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. , Japan’s largest shipping line by
market value, rose 2.3 percent to 539 yen. Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co., the world’s largest shipbuilder, jumped 3.6
percent to 345,000 won.  The  Baltic Dry Index  of commodity-shipping rates jumped 2.7
percent yesterday, rising for a fourth day to its highest level
since Sept. 17.  Australia’s benchmark index reversed losses after the
employment report.  Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd. , the country’s
second-biggest airline, jumped 3.5 percent to 45 Australian
cents.  Woolworths Ltd. , Australia’s biggest retailer, climbed
0.7 percent to A$30.07.  JB Hi-Fi Ltd. , an electronics retailer,
gained 1.3 percent to A$21.32.  “Australia, which has been a relative underperformer this
year, is starting to look a bit better,” said AMP’s Oliver.
“Supported by a relatively strong Australian economy, today’s
jobs figures were better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
