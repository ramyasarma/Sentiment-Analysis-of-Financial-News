Ukraine may sell Eurobonds in the
first half of next year, Deputy Fianance Minister Andriy Kravets
told reporters today in Kiev.  The government wants to sell Eurobonds next year, and the
best time for a sale would be the first half, Kravets said.  Kravets also said the International Monetary Fund may send
a mission to Ukraine in early November for a review of the
