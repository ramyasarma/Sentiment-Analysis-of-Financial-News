Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc . began
soliciting votes from lenders for a streamlined bankruptcy plan
that would turn over management of the struggling film studio to
Spyglass Entertainment.  Creditors would exchange more than $4 billion in debt for
about 95 percent of the equity when MGM emerges from bankruptcy,
the Los Angeles based company said today in a statement.
Spyglass and its affiliates would get about 5 percent of the
equity in exchange for some assets.  Spyglass Entertainment Co-Chairmen  Gary Barber  and  Roger Birnbaum , who produced the supernatural thriller “The Sixth
Sense” and “Seabiscuit,” previously signed a non-binding
letter of intent to operate the studio and swap the rights to
their film library for a stake in the MGM, people with knowledge
of the situation said.  MGM will seek bankruptcy court approval for the two men to
assume the top management roles at the studio. Votes on the
proposal are due by Oct. 22, the company said. Voting is limited
to holders of secured debt as of Oct. 4 under MGM’s April 8,
2005 credit agreement, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
