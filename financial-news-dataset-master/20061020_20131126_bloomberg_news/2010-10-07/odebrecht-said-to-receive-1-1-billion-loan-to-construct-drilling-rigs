Odebrecht SA’s oil and gas division
will receive a $1.1 billion syndicated loan to pay for
construction of two drilling rigs, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  BNP Paribas SA and HSBC Holdings Plc are arranging the 12-
year credit line to Odebrecht Oleo e Gas, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the terms aren’t set. More
than 10 banks may participate in the transaction.  Odebrecht on Sept. 7 sold $500 million of perpetual bonds
to yield 7.5 percent, after doubling the size of the offering.
The Salvador-based company plans to invest $3.5 billion by 2013
in drilling platforms, Valor Economico reported on Sept. 10,
citing President  Miguel Gradin .  The company will operate the drilling rigs, under
construction at Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in
South Korea, in a 10-year contract with Petroleo Brasileiro SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
