Israel’s foreign currency reserves
increased to a record in September as the Bank of Israel bought
foreign currency to try to moderate shekel gains.  Reserves rose to $66.3 billion at the end of the month, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. The $2.15 billion
increase was mainly due to purchases of $699 million by the
central bank and a $1.66 billion revaluation of reserves, the
bank said.  Central bank Governor  Stanley Fischer  began buying foreign
currency in March 2008 and has more than doubled reserves since
then in an attempt to limit gains in the shekel and help
exporters weather the global economic crisis.  Fischer bought more foreign currency this month, traders
said, as the shekel appreciated to its strongest level in two
years against the dollar, which is sliding against currencies
worldwide.  The Bank of Israel bought more than $500 million today,
said  Doron Levi , head of the dealing room at Mizrahi Tefahot
Bank Ltd., weakening the shekel and reversing earlier gains. The
shekel slid 0.2 percent against the dollar to 3.5934 at 3:10
p.m. in Tel Aviv.  To contact the reporter on this story:
