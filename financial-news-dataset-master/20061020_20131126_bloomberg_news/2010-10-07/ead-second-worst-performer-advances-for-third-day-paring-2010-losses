Lead, the second-worst performer on
the London Metal Exchange after zinc, gained 0.3 percent to 
$2,322 a metric ton by 8:02 a.m. Singapore time, paring the 
year’s losses.  The metal, used mainly in batteries, reached $2,359.75 a
ton yesterday, the highest price since April, as a weaker dollar
spurred demand for alternative investments. The three-month 
contract is down 4.5 percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
