Japan’s sale of 2.2 trillion yen ($27
billion) in 10-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted price of
99.59, according to the median forecast of 14 traders surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 0.8 percent
bonds ranged from 99.61 to 99.5, according to the survey. Three
traders each said 99.6, 99.59 and 99.58. Two traders each said
99.61 and 99.55. One reported 99.50.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
