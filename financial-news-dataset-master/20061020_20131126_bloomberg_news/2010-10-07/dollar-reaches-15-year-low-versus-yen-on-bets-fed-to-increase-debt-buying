The dollar fell to the lowest level
since 1995 against the yen on speculation the Federal Reserve
will debase the currency by stepping up purchases of government
debt to support the economic recovery.  The euro erased its gain after surpassing $1.40 for the
first time since February as European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said exchange rates should reflect economic
fundamentals. Sterling touched a level above $1.60 as the Bank
of England refrained from increasing its bond-buying program.  “The weak-dollar theme has not begun to change,” said
 Boris Schlossberg , director of research at the online foreign-
exchange trader GFT Forex in New York. “The reason the euro
will continue to be strong is the ECB, by not doing anything,
looks hawkish in comparison to the Fed.”  The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 82.39 yen at 4:04 p.m. in
New York, from 82.93 yesterday. It touched 82.11, the lowest
level since May 1995. The euro traded at $1.3912, compared with
$1.3930, after touching $1.4029, the highest level since Jan.
28. The euro slid 0.8 percent to 114.60 yen, from 115.53.  The euro fell earlier today after breaking $1.40, where
orders to sell the currency may have been clustered, according
to analysts. The seven-day relative strength index of the euro
touched 81.22, remaining above 70 for a 14th consecutive day in
the longest stretch since March 2008. Readings above 70 indicate
a currency may be poised to drop.  ‘Overbought Territory’  “It is a cliff that the euro climbed very quickly,” said
 Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at Wells Fargo & Co.
in New York. “The technical momentum indicators are pointing to
overbought territory for the euro.”  Australia’s dollar surged to a record versus its U.S.
counterpart and neared parity as employers added the most jobs
in eight months. The loonie fell from almost a five-month high
before U.S. and Canadian employment reports tomorrow.  The  Dollar Index , used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners including the euro, yen, pound, Swiss franc,
Canadian dollar and Swedish krona, gained 0.1 percent to 77.45
after touching 76.91, the lowest level since Jan. 15.  The yen was stronger versus the dollar than on Sept. 15,
when Japan acknowledged intervening in the currency market to
protect its export-dependent economy.  Japan’s Vice Finance Minister  Fumihiko Igarashi  said in an
interview today that “it’s not our intention to engage in a
currency-devaluation race.”  Trichet on Dollar  Trichet said at a press conference in Frankfurt that he
supports a “strong dollar” and opposes “disorderly” shifts
in global exchange rates.  The gauge of the greenback has dropped 4 percent since Aug.
10, when the Fed said after its policy meeting that it would
keep its bond holdings level by resuming the purchase of U.S.
debt to support a recovery it described as “more modest” than
earlier anticipated.  Private nonfarm payrolls climbed by 75,000 in September
after an increase of 67,000 in the previous month, according to
the median forecast of 59 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before tomorrow’s report from the Labor Department. The jobless
rate is expected to increase to 9.7 percent from 9.6 percent.  The central bank completed in March a program in which it
created new money to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-
backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt,
debasing the dollar. The Fed was the biggest buyer of Treasuries
when it purchased $300 billion of U.S. debt in 2009.  Weekly Decline  The dollar was headed for a third weekly drop against the
yen and a fourth weekly decline against the euro before
tomorrow’s meeting of Group of Seven industrialized nations.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , who chairs the G-7
gathering, said yesterday that “there are concerns about
interventions in currency markets” and that he’s “sure” the
issue will be discussed. Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
warned on Sept. 27 of a “currency war.”  Australia’s currency climbed 0.4 percent to 98.10 U.S.
cents after touching 99.18, the most since exchange controls
were ended in 1983. The South Pacific nation’s employers added
49,500 workers and the unemployment rate held at 5.1 percent in
September, the government reported.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known, declined 0.7
percent to C$1.0183 per U.S. dollar after reaching C$1.0063
yesterday, the strongest level since April 30.  South Africa’s rand slid from 6.8310 per dollar, the
strongest level in more than two years, after the central bank
said there was a “definite place” for measures to stem inflows
that boosted the rand by more than 35 percent since the start of
2009. The currency declined as much as 1 percent to 6.9321.  The pound appreciated to an eight-month high of $1.6018
after the Bank of England held the target for bond holdings at
200 billion pounds ($319 billion). Sterling later fell 0.1
percent to $1.5872.  To contact the reporter on this story:
