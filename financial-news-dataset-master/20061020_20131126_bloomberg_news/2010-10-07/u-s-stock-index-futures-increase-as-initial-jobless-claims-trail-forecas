U.S. stock-index futures advanced
after initial jobless claims unexpectedly decreased, bolstering
optimism in the economic recovery.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.1 percent to 1,157 at 8:31 a.m. in New York.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 11 points, or 0.1
percent, to 10,917.      Initial jobless claims dropped by 11,000 to 445,000 in the
week ended Oct. 2, the fewest since July 10, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. Economists projected 455,000
new claims last week, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. The total number of people receiving
unemployment insurance decreased and those getting extended
payments jumped.  The S&P 500 lost 0.1 percent to 1,1159.97 yesterday, a day
after the gauge rallied to an almost five-month high, after a
report showing an unexpected decrease in private payrolls
undermined confidence in the economic recovery.  U.S. two-year Treasury yields fell to a record low amid
speculation that the Federal Reserve will resume asset purchases  under its quantitative-easing plan, aiming to boost growth as
job data points to a slowing economic recovery.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
