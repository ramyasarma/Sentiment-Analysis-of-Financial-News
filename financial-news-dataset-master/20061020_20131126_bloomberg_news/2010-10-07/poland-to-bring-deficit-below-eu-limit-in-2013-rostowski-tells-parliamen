Poland will more than halve its
budget deficit over the next three years, bringing it below the
European Union limit of 3 percent of economic output in 2013,
Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  said.  The general government deficit, calculated under the EU’s
accounting rules, will fall to 6.5 percent of gross domestic
product next year, 4.5 percent in 2012 and 2.9 percent in 2013,
Rostowski said today in Warsaw as parliamentary debate on next
year’s budget began.  The EU’s largest eastern economy abandoned a 2012 euro
adoption target after its deficit swelled to more than double
the bloc’s limit last year. The shortfall may widen to 8 percent
of GDP this year, Prime Minister  Donald Tusk  said Oct. 5.  Poland faced a choice between “gradual and determined”
steps to curb the deficit or “shock” therapy, and it “decided
to undertake gradual reforms as it assures higher efficiency,”
Rostowski said in Parliament.  Poland’s main problem is its large structural deficit
resulting from tax cuts and spending increases in 2006-2007,
Rostowski said. The decision to increase the value-added tax by
1 percentage point next year was designed to “buy time” until
overhauls of the pension and health-care systems bring savings,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
