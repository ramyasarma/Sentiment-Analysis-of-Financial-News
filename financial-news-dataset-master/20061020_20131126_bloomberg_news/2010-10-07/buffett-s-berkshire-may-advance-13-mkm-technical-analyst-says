Shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. are poised to rise as much as 13 percent,
according to  Katie Stockton , chief market technician at MKM
Partners LLC.  Berkshire’s  Class B shares  since last month have been
“challenging resistance” at their March highs, and secondary
resistance at $94 is “our intermediate-term target upon a
decisive breakout,” Stockton said in a note today. The stock
closed yesterday at $83.54, matching the two-year high it set on
Sept. 16.  “A breakout appears likely to us because the recent
consolidation phase has relieved intermediate-term overbought
conditions” and “momentum is positive,” Stockton, who is
based in Greenwich, Connecticut, said in the note.  Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire reports third-quarter
earnings on about Nov. 5. The  holding company  with units in
industries such as insurance, railroads, manufactured homes and
media reported a 40 percent profit decline in the three months
ended June 30 as Buffett’s derivative bets on equity indexes
produced losses.  Technical analysts study price charts to predict market
moves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
