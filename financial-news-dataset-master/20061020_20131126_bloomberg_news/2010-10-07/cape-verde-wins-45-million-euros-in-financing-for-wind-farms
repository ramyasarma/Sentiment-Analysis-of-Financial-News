Cape Verde won 45 million euros ($62
million) in funding from the European Investment Bank and the
African Development Bank to finance the construction of wind
farms that will produce more than 28 megawatts of electricity,
the EIB said in an e-mailed statement today.  The equipment will be provided by Denmark’s Vestas Wind
Systems A/S and will be developed in a venture between Cape
Verde’s government and Electra, a local utility, the EIB said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
