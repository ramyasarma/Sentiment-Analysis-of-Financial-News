Emerging-market stocks fluctuated as
a rally in shipping lines was countered by a drop in technology
shares. Currencies gained on speculation easing measures by
developed nations will drive fund flows toward riskier assets.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  was little changed at
1,106.75 as of 1:40 p.m. in Singapore, following a six-day, 4.3
percent rally that lifted the measure to the highest level since
June 20, 2008. The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index  jumped 1.2
percent to a record close. Asian currencies traded near the
highest levels in more than two years, with the Thai baht rising
to a 13-year high against the dollar.  “We are of the belief that the emerging markets will
continue to outperform,”  Michael Preiss , chief equities
strategist at Standard Chartered Bank, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from Singapore. “There will be bumps,
there will be corrections, but net-net, you should be long.”  STX Pan Ocean Co. , South Korea’s largest bulk carrier,
surged the most in a month after a measure of commodity-shipping
costs climbed. PetroChina Co. gained as  crude oil  rose for a
third day.  Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s second-largest
maker of semiconductors, fell 2.7 percent in Seoul after
reporting profit that missed estimates.  Samsung’s Profit  STX Pan Ocean jumped 12 percent in Seoul, the best
performer on the MSCI emerging markets gauge.  Korea Line Corp. 
gained 3.5 percent. The  Baltic Dry Index  climbed 2.7 percent
yesterday while the cost of hiring a capesize, ships three times
the length of a football field, jumped 6.3 percent, rounding off
a three-day, 20 percent rally, according to the Baltic Exchange
in London.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil company, advanced
for a second day in Hong Kong. Crude rose as much as 0.4 percent
to $83.53 a barrel, after yesterday climbing to the highest
settlement since May 3.  Gains on the MSCI gauge were capped by a 0.6 percent
decline in the industry group tracking technology stocks.
Samsung said its third-quarter operating  income  rose 14 percent
to 4.8 trillion won ($4.3 billion) from a year earlier, lagging
behind the 5.03 trillion won average of 11 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The baht rose to 29.84 per dollar, breaching the 30 level
yesterday for the first time since 1997, the year its
devaluation triggered the Asian financial crisis. Thailand may
do more to relax limits on money outflows and boost support for
exporters most affected by the strengthening currency, while
monitoring “excessive speculation,” Prime Minister  Abhisit Vejjajiva  said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg News in
New York.  The Taiwan dollar climbed 1.2 percent to NT$30.799, its
strongest since August 2008, before a government report that may
show exports gained for an 11th month. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia Dollar Index traded at 115.19 after reaching 115.44
yesterday, a level it last touched in April 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
