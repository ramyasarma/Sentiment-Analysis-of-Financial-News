Corn prices jumped to the highest
level in a week on speculation that the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter, will cut its crop forecast for the second time
in two months after floods and hot weather damaged plants.  Production may fall to 12.977 billion bushels from a record
13.11 billion last year, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Yields may drop 5 percent to 156.6 bushels this year, more than
the 2.7 percent drop forecast in the survey, according to
Farmers National Co., the largest manager of crop land. The
government will update its estimates tomorrow.  “The market is anticipating a smaller U.S. crop will
require higher prices to slow demand,” said  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana. “Farmers
across the Midwest have consistently reported disappointing
yields.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $4.975 a bushel at 10:27 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $5.025, the highest level
for a most-active contract since Sept. 30.  Falling grain production in other exporting nations will
boost demand for U.S. corn, Gerlach said.  Ukraine, the world’s largest barley exporter, set quotas on
shipments of all grains to ensure food security and cap domestic
prices.  Corn exports in Brazil, the third-largest shipper, may fall
next year to 8 million metric tons from an estimated 9.5 million
tons this year because of a smaller harvest, said  Silvio Porto ,
a director at the Agriculture Ministry’s crop-forecasting
agency.  U.S. exporters made spot sales of 548,640 tons of corn for
delivery to Mexico in the year ending Aug. 31 and 274,320 tons
for delivery in the year starting Sept. 1, the Department of
Agriculture said today.  “Demand is increasing,” Gerlach said. “Buyers are
getting nervous about tightening U.S. supplies.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show. Argentina is the second-biggest
exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
