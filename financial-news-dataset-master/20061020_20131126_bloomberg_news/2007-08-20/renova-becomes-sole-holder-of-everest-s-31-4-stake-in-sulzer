             Renova Group, the investment company
controlled by Russian billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg , said it
bought the 50 percent of Everest Beteiligungs GmbH it didn't
already own and with it has become the sole holder of 31.4
percent in  Sulzer AG. (SUN)   
 Renova bought the remainder of Everest, a shareholder in
Sulzer, from its partner Victory Industriebeteiligung AG, Renova
said in a statement today. Renova is now the sole holder of 17.5
percent in Sulzer voting shares and 13.9 percent in call options.  
 ``This acquisition demonstrates our group's strong belief in
the future of Sulzer and our desire to become a long-term
investor and a business partner of the company,'' Vladimir
Kuznetsov, Renova's chief investment officer, said in the
statement.  
 On April 20, Renova and its partner bought the stake in
Sulzer, whose clients include Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc.  
 Victory, which is co-owned by Austrian investors Georg Stumpf and Ronny Pecik, and Renova didn't disclose any financial
details about the transaction.  
 Sulzer, the world's second-biggest pump maker, is expected
to report first-half results tomorrow and may say profit surged
25 percent on demand from the oil industry, according to a survey
of analysts.
