             David Kappos , the head of the U.S.
patent office, said his agency is “on the hunt” to cut its
applications backlog to the lowest since 2007 to further
President Barack Obama’s goal of job growth through innovation.  
 U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  application reviews, which
often take more than two years, have been sped up and hiring
practices improved, Kappos, 49, said in an interview yesterday
at Bloomberg’s Washington office. Kappos says the changes are
part of efforts to help the U.S. maintain its economic power.  
 “I’m quite convinced there’s really only one way that will
happen and it will be based on innovation,” said Kappos, who
spent more than two decades as an engineer and intellectual
property lawyer for  International Business Machines Corp. 
“Innovation-driven companies, small and large, especially
small, are huge creators of jobs and creators of wealth.”  
 Obama, who yesterday said he recognizes that the U.S.
economic recovery has been “painfully slow,” has called for
incentives to promote American ingenuity as part of his measures
to create jobs and expand productivity. Patent  applications  are
up about 4 percent for the year that ends this month, following
a 2.3 percent drop in fiscal 2009, led by medical, computer,
biotechnology and nanotechnology inventions, Kappos said.  
 “The U.S. business sector seems to be reviving,” Kappos
said. “The recovery isn’t as fast as we’d like it to be, but
one leading indicator is the filing of patent applications.”  
 ‘Locked Down’  
 Kappos said he has been working to improve the efficiency
of the patent office and eliminate a backlog of applications
that had reached 750,000.  
 “You can think of each one of these as a business, as some
new product or service that’s sequestered in a government
agency, that’s locked down, that’s inhibited from reaching the
marketplace,” Kappos said. “To have 750,000 of these things
sitting in a government agency is not good for innovation.”  
 In the 13 months he’s headed the agency, Kappos has worked
to meet an interim goal of cutting the backlog to less than
700,000 by the end of this fiscal year. He said it would be the
first time in three years that “the first significant digit of
the USPTO’s backlog was anything other than a 7.” He said he
wants to have an “inventory” of pending applications of
325,000 by 2015.  
 “We’re fans of his,” said  Herb Wamsley , executive
director of the Intellectual Property Owners Association, which
represents companies including Intel Corp., Monsanto Co.,
Johnson & Johnson, and 3M Co. “He has been very energetic in
creating a great many proposals and he’s very creative.”  
 Kappos had been vice president of the Washington-based
group and was in line to be president before he was tapped by
Commerce Secretary  Gary Locke  to head the patent office.  
 Candy and Overtime  
 Obama has  proposed  a $2.32 billion budget for the agency in
the year starting Oct. 1, with a 15 percent increase in fees to
help pay for changes Kappos is making. The agency is funded by
the fees it collects.  
 To reach his goals, Kappos said he is drawing from his time
at  IBM , the world’s largest computer-services provider, to
introduce more “business-related processes” at the agency. He
has changed how examiners process applications, with more
personal interviews with inventors early in the process. The
agency is holding pep rallies and approving overtime, and Kappos
is handing out candy to improve morale and productivity.  
 “I’m just running business plays at the USPTO and so far
no one’s told me you can’t do this,” Kappos said. “So I keep
running the plays I learned from 26 years in the business
sector.”  
 Fast-Track Programs  
 There were 485,500  patent applications  filed in fiscal
2009, and 190,121 patents issued, the most in the agency’s
history. There were more patents issued in fiscal 2009 than
applications filed in fiscal 1993, according to agency data.  
 Kappos created a special program that lets applicants with
inventions that increase energy efficiency petition for a
speedier review. The so-called green energy program has been so
popular, a similar approach is being considered for other
products including medical devices, Kappos said.  
 The agency also is developing a three-track system that
would let applicants, for a fee, get their inventions reviewed
in about a year. Kappos said he expects smaller businesses will
take advantage of the program, which may begin in about a year.  
 Inventors of some medical devices may want fast processing,
while drugmakers aren’t in a hurry because they’re also waiting
on regulatory approval, Kappos said, likening the program to
tiered pricing options by companies such as FedEx Corp.  
 “Not every package needs to go by ground delivery,” he
said. “Some packages need to go by overnight, some packages
ground delivery is fine, and some you say look I’ll just send it
third-class, it’s bulk mail, it can take two weeks.”  
 Kappos also has changed the agency’s hiring practice --
selecting people who have more experience rather than those just
coming out of college. The patent office plans to hire 1,000
examiners annually in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. It has about
6,200 examiners, up from 3,500 in fiscal 2002.
