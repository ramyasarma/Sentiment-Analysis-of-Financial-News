             VTB Group (VTBR) , owner of  Russia 's second-
biggest bank, sold its stake in  European Aeronautic Defence &
Space Co. (EAD) , parent of planemaker Airbus, to state-owned
Vnesheconombank.  
 VTB disposed of 41 million shares, or more than 5 percent,
of EADS, the Moscow-based bank said today in a statement,
without providing details of the transaction.  
 Vnesheconombank agreed to help OAO United Aircraft Corp.,
Russia's state aviation holding company, finance its
development, and may become a shareholder in the aerospace
company. United Aircraft wants to buy a stake in EADS as it
seeks closer cooperation with the western European company.  
 VTB will receive 995 million euros ($1.46 billion) for the
stake, about the same as it paid last year, Interfax reported
today, citing Vasily Titov, deputy chairman of VTB. The bank
sold the stake at 24.23 euros a share, Interfax said.  
 EADS shares fell 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 22.13 euros
in Paris today. VTB shares fell 0.6 percent to 12.53 kopeks in
Moscow today. A kopek is one 100th of a ruble.
