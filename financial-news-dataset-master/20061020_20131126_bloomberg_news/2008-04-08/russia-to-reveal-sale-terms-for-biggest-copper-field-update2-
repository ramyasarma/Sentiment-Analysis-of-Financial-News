             Russia will announce auction terms
for the country's biggest untapped copper deposit within a week,
the Natural Resources Ministry said.  
 Minister Yuri Trutnev today ordered the Federal Subsoil
Agency to complete preparations for the sale of the Udokan
deposit and announce them within seven days, the ministry said in
an e-mailed statement.  
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) , the country's biggest mining
company, helped the government reassess the deposit, which holds
at least 13.4 million metric tons of copper. The field requires
$1.6 billion of investment and will be able to produce 187,000
tons a year, equal to 15 percent of the country's current output,
the ministry said.  
 Norilsk may bid for Udokan, Chief Executive Officer Denis Morozov told reporters in Moscow today. ``We'll review this
possibility once the auction terms are known,'' he said.  
 Norilsk, controlled by billionaires  Vladimir Potanin  and
 Mikhail Prokhorov , is planning a $5.4 billion copper project in
the Chita region of Siberia where Udokan is located. The company
is building rail infrastructure, and mining and processing sites
to develop the Bystrinskoye group of deposits. Norilsk has said
it mines 2.4 percent of the world's copper and earns a quarter of
its revenue from copper sales.  
 Urals Mining & Metals Co., Russia's second-largest copper
miner, and  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , Kazakhstan's biggest producer of the
metal, have also said they are interested in Udokan.
