             Southern Co ., the biggest U.S.
power producer, agreed to a contract for two planned nuclear
units near Augusta, Georgia, with a team that includes
Westinghouse Electric Co. and the Shaw Group Inc.  
 The team entered into an engineering, procurement and
construction contract, Southern said today in a statement. The
new units would be built at the Vogtle power plant site.  
 Southern is proposing to add a pair of reactors to the
two-unit Vogtle site in Georgia. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has said it expects by the end of 2010 to have
applications seeking to build as many as 33 new reactors in the
U.S. There are 104 operating reactors in the country.  
 The new Westinghouse AP1000 power units each have a
generating capacity of about 1,100 megawatts. One megawatt is
enough power for about 800 average U.S. homes, according to
Energy Department estimates.  
 Southern said it plans to submit the contract to the
Georgia Public Service Commission in May for a 2016-2017
capacity request proposal. Co-owners of the plant include
Oglethorpe Power, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and
Dalton Utilities.  
 Southern rose 2 cents to $36.27 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The statement was released after the close
of regular trading on U.S. stock markets.
