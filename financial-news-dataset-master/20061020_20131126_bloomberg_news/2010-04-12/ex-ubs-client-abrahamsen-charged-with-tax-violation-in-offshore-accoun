             A former  UBS AG  client who played
soccer on the Soviet national team pleaded guilty to failing to
tell U.S. tax authorities about $2.6 million held in an offshore
account.  
 Leonid Zaltsberg, 75, admitted that he didn’t declare to
the Internal Revenue Service a nominee Panamanian account set up
with the help of a UBS banker and a Swiss lawyer he didn’t
identify in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.  
 “Did you seek advice from UBS employees on how to keep
your foreign bank account hidden from the IRS?” U.S. District
Judge  Stanley Chesler  asked Zaltsberg, who answered in the
affirmative.  
 UBS, the largest Swiss bank, paid $780 million last year to
avoid prosecution, admitted it aided tax evasion from 2000 to
2007, and gave the IRS data on 250 secret accounts, including
Zaltsberg’s, court records show. UBS later agreed to reveal data
on another 4,450 accounts.  
 Since the UBS deferred-prosecution agreement, the Justice
Department filed criminal tax charges against 16 other UBS
clients in the U.S., two UBS bankers, and three others accused
of enabling tax evasion. At least 150 other people are being
investigated, prosecutors said. Last year, 15,000 Americans
sought to avoid prosecution by disclosing offshore accounts.  
 Soviet Athlete  
 Zaltsberg was a member of the Soviet Union’s national
soccer team in the 1960s and played in the World Cup, according
to his daughter, Larisa Beyder, who attended the hearing. He
came to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1989 and settled in Milltown,
New Jersey, said his attorney, James DiPietro. Zaltsberg, who
became a U.S. citizen, was a metals trader from 1990 to 2004,
DiPietro said.  
 Zaltsberg, who is now an adviser to the Ukrainian national
soccer team, suffers from bladder and prostate cancer, as well
as
depression, DiPietro said. He’s also had open-heart surgery and
four stents inserted, his daughter said.  
 Zaltsberg, speaking through an interpreter, admitted that
he set up a UBS account in 1993, and that he set up the
Panamanian corporation, Belton Capital Corp., in 2000. Zaltsberg
said he created Belton to hide his assets from the IRS.  
 In pleading guilty to filing a false tax return in 2003,
Zaltsberg also admitted that he failed to file Reports of
Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBARs, from 2000 to
2007. He will pay $1.3 million, or a 50 percent FBAR on the
highest amount of his account, DiPietro said. The tax loss to
the U.S., the lawyer said, was about $60,000.  
 The case is United States of America v. Leonid Zaltsberg,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).
