             Sky Network Television Ltd.,  New
Zealand 's largest pay-TV company, said full-year profit rose 23
percent because of an increase in subscribers and advertising
sales after it added channels.  
 Net income rose to NZ$77.9 million ($53.7 million), or 20
cents a share, in the year ended June 30, from NZ$60.2 million,
or 15.5 cents, a year earlier, the Auckland-based company said
in a statement today. Profit exceeded the NZ$75.8 million median
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The result is within Sky's Feb. 27 forecast of full-year
profit of NZ$75 million to NZ$80 million. The company will pay a
second-half dividend of 5 cents a share.  
 Sales rose 11 percent to NZ$618.5 million.
