             Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest casino owner, will spend A$160 million ($146 million) to
woo high-stakes bettors to Star City in Sydney with new luxury
suites, private gambling rooms and its first two jet planes.  
 The aim is to win back gamblers from rival  Crown Ltd.  and
Asian destinations such as Macau and Singapore, Chief Executive
Officer  Elmer Funke Kupper  said in an interview yesterday.  
 The spending is part of an A$860 million facelift for  Star
City , Sydney’s only casino, which makes about half as much money
as Crown’s Melbourne venue while being in a city 30 percent
larger.  Tabcorp  has lost market share among so-called high
rollers as its domestic rival spends A$212 million upgrading VIP
facilities, including adding its third plane for big spenders.  
 “It makes sense to go after that segment because it’s so
lucrative but it’s going to be very hard to close the gap,”
said  Theo Maas , who helps manage A$5 billion of equities at
Arnhem Investment Management in Sydney. “Star City has the
potential to do much better.”  
 More than 70 percent of  Macau casino sales  come from high-
stakes gambling.  Revenue  for casinos in the only place in China
where they are legal surged 68 percent this year to 102.2
billion patacas ($12.8 billion)  
 Tabcorp  fell 1.5 percent to close at A$6.66 in Sydney. The
 stock  has dropped 4.2 percent this year, compared with a 6.3
percent decline in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  
 Star City Refurbishment  
 The Star City refurbishment includes a redesigned gaming
floor, new restaurants, and hotel and conference facilities. The
casino is located in Sydney’s Pyrmont area, overlooking the
western part of Australia’s biggest city.  
 The revamp is being overseen by  Larry Mullin , who joined
the company last year along with two colleagues from the Borgata
Hotel Casino & Spa, the most profitable gambling house in
Atlantic City.  
 “ Tabcorp  has historically performed below its potential in
VIP,”  Nathan Gee , an analyst at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch, said in a note to clients. Doubling revenue at Star City
from A$100 million to A$200 million after the renovation is
“not unreasonable,” Gee, who rates the stock a “buy,” said.  
 For the 45-year-old Funke Kupper, who took the role in
2007, the new spending is about correcting an
“underinvestment” in Star City.  
 “To get these customers you need to have the right offer,
with the property, restaurants, entertainment service which is
what we are now doing,” Funke Kupper said. “Sydney has got a
tremendous reputation as a destination and that really plays in
our favor.”  
 The planes the company intends to buy must be capable of
flying non-stop from north Asia, Funke Kupper said.  
 Local Monopolies  
 Australian casinos are typically local monopolies, with no
competing venues in the same city.  
 Melbourne-based  Tabcorp  also owns three casinos in
Queensland state as well as betting shops and slot machines.  
 Crown  owns casinos in Perth and Melbourne, including one
with its own  golf course , and has about a third of  Melco Crown
Entertainment Ltd. , which operates two casinos in Macau, the
world’s biggest gambling hub.  
 It is the Melco connection that might be the biggest
challenge to Tabcorp in gaining ground on Crown, according to
Arnhem’s Maas.  
 “It’s a massively competitive market and you need to have
the contacts and infrastructure in place which  Crown  has,” said
Maas. “It means  Tabcorp  has to compete with the very best in
the region.”
