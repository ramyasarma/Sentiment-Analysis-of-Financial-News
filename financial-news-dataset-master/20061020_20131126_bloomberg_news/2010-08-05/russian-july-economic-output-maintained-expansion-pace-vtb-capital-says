             Russia’s economy expanded in July at
the same pace as the month before as manufacturing picked up and
service industries from hotels to supermarkets grew at a slower
rate, a gauge of output showed.  
 Gross domestic product  rose an annual 2.4 percent in July,
unchanged from June, Moscow-based VTB Capital said in a
statement today. Average second quarter growth was 1.9 percent,
the highest since the fourth quarter of 2008, it said.  
 The report reflects “the ongoing recovery in the Russian
economy, driven by the continued expansion of activity across
both the manufacturing and services sectors,”  Aleksandra Evtifyeva , VTB Capital’s senior economist, said in the
statement. “Anecdotal evidence suggests the heat wave has had a
negative effect on overall activity levels.”  
 VTB Capital calculates its indicator by using output
measures from its Purchasing Managers’ Indexes, which are
surveys of business conditions in manufacturing and services
industries.
