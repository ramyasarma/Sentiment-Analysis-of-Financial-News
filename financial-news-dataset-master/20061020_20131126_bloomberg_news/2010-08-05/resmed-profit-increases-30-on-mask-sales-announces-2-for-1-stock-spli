             ResMed Inc. , the world’s second-
biggest maker of machines to regulate breathing for people with
sleeping disorders, said full-year profit rose 30 percent.  
 Net income increased to $190.1 million in the 12 months
ended June 30 from $146.4 million a year ago, the Poway,
California-based company said in a statement today. The  S&P
Global 1200 Health Care index , which tracks the industry’s world
stock values, rose 7 percent in the 12 months to June 30.  
 “Continued growth will also come from the increasing
confirmation of the strong impact of the relationship between
sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea and co-
morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and
obesity,”  Kieran Gallahue , the company’s president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  
 ResMed announced a two-for-one split of the company’s
outstanding shares of common stock. The shares fell 1.9 percent
to A$7.23 at the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney.
