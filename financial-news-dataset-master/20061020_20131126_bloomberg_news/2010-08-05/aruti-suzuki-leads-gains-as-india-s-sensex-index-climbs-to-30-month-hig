             India’s benchmark stock index fell
for the second day from the highest level in 30 months as some
investors judged recent gains as overdone relative to the
earnings outlook.  
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. , the largest software
services exporter, fell 1.5 percent. The stock is trading at
21.5 times estimated profit, compared with the 17.1 times for
the Sensex.  DLF Ltd. , the biggest developer, lost 1 percent,
dropping for the first day in five.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. 
climbed after a newspaper reported it will build a factory to
produce tractors.  
 “Investors are focusing on specific stocks as the broader
market is overvalued,” said  Alex Mathews , head of research at
Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi. “The
demand outlook for the auto sector remains strong. It is a good
sign that companies are increasing capacities.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 28.84, or 0.2 percent, to 18,143.99, erasing an earlier
gain of as much as 0.4 percent that took it to the highest level
since February 2008. The gauge has climbed 1.5 percent this week.  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
0.1 percent to 5,439.25. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.1 percent
to 2,311.27.  
 Expensive  
 Tata Consultancy dropped 1.5 percent to 864.7 rupees. The
stock had soared 5.5 percent in the previous two trading
sessions. DLF lost 1 percent to 307.7 rupees, trimming its
advance this week to 2.1 percent.  
 Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have climbed 46
percent this year, making the Sensex the most  expensive  in Asia,
excluding Japan, and the BRIC markets, which include China,
Brazil and Russia.  
 Mahindra rose 0.5 percent to 648.75 rupees. The company
plans to spend as much as 18 billion rupees ($390 million) to
set up a tractor-building plant in the south Indian state of
Tamil Nadu, Business Standard reported, citing  Pawan Goenka ,
president of the automotive and farm equipment unit. Goenka
didn’t answer a call to his cell phone seeking comment.  
 Tata Motors Ltd. , the maker of the world’s cheapest car,
the Nano, surged 3.8 percent to 893.7 rupees, its highest level
since January 2007. India’s direct tax collection between April
and July rose 16 percent, about five times faster than in the
year earlier period.  
 ‘Magic Bullet’  
 India’s direct tax collection between April and July
climbed to 856.5 billion rupees from 739.9 billion rupees a year
earlier, the country’s finance ministry said yesterday.
Corporate tax collections increased 21 percent. Total levies
collected rose 3.3 percent a year earlier.  
 “The increased tax collection shows that people will have
more money to spend and invest,” said Mathews.  
 State Bank of India , the biggest lender, dropped 1 percent
to 2619.35 rupees. The Reserve Bank of India has no “magic
bullet” to manage growth and curb inflation and monetary policy
is “the first line of defense” against inflation, Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday.  
 Essar Shipping  jumped 6.2 percent to 115.4 rupees, its
highest close since August 2008. The nation’s second-largest
marine transport company by market value advanced after raising
$280 million selling convertible bonds to its parent to buy
ships and expand ports.  
 Going Digital  
 Hathway Cable & Datacom Ltd. , India’s largest cable-
television operator, surged 8.6 percent to 211.95 rupees after
the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India fixed a date for
service providers to migrate to digital cable TV.  
 TRAI, as the regulator is known, yesterday set deadlines of
Dec. 31, 2013, for service providers to migrate analog cable
customers to digital cable TV.  
 DEN Networks Ltd.  rose 12 percent to 237.25 rupees. Wire
and Wireless India Ltd. added 9.3 percent to 15.35 rupees, while
 Dish TV India Ltd.  jumped 6.3 percent to 49.8 rupees.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  7.42 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on August 4, the 22nd straight day that purchases have
exceeded sales, raising their total investments in the stocks
this year to 510.2 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.
