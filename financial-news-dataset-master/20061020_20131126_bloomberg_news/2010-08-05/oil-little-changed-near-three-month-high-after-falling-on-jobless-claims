             Crude oil rose, headed for the
biggest weekly gain in four, as rising equities and a weak
dollar prompted traders to buy back previously sold contracts.  
 Oil climbed for the first time in three days after rising
Asian drove the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  to its fifth weekly
advance. The dollar traded near the weakest level against the
euro in more than three months, bolstering speculative demand
for commodities.  
 “Oil prices are still in position to advance if we get
strong moves higher in the euro or in equities as a result of a
bullish employment report on Friday,”  Peter Beutel , president
of energy adviser Cameron Hanover Inc. in New Canaan,
Connecticut, said in a note. “There could be short-covering
ahead of the weekend, based on fears of a tropical storm or
hurricane as well.”  
 Crude for September delivery rose as much as 45 cents, 0.6
percent, to $82.46 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $82.41 at 3:08 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract declined 46 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $82.01, the lowest settlement since Aug. 2.
Futures, up more than 4 percent this week, are 14 percent higher
than a year ago.  
 Most Asian stocks rose as gains by real-estate companies
overshadowed declines among exporters following an increase in
U.S. jobless claims.  
 Brent Crude  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange rose as much as 30 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $81.91 a barrel. It was at $81.86 at 2:58 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract fell 59 cents, or 0.7
percent, to end the session at $81.61.  
 Oil prices declined yesterday after the rising jobless
claims prompted concern a slowing economic recovery will curb
demand for fuels. The Labor Department yesterday said first-time
claims for unemployment insurance climbed to a three-month high
of 479,000 in the week ended July 31.  
 “The market had been rallying but now it feels like it’s
running out of steam,” said  Clarence Chu , an options trader
with Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore. “Most of the data
tells me that the recovery is slowing down.”  
 Economists forecast U.S. initial jobless claims would fall
to 455,000, according to the median of 43 projections. The
government revised the prior week’s total to 460,000 from a
previously reported 457,000.  
 Payrolls Report  
 A report on non-farm payrolls due today may show a drop of
65,000 jobs for July, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. Private rolls may have gained by 90,000 spots.  
 An Energy Department report Aug. 4 showed crude supplies in
the U.S.  Midwest  surged to a record as nationwide fuel
stockpiles rose. Overall U.S. inventories fell by 2.8 million
barrels in the week ended July 30 after a drawdown in the U.S.
Gulf Coast region offset the builds in the center of the country
and in the West Coast.  
 Stockpiles at  Cushing , Oklahoma, the delivery point for New
York futures contracts based on West Texas crude, climbed 1.8
percent to 37.8 million, leaving inventories less than 1 percent
below the all-time high set in May.  
 “This is definitely bearish for West Texas oil,” said Chu
at Hudson Capital Energy. “It’s the peak season for gasoline
production yet we’ve got builds in Cushing.”  
 Gasoline supplies  increased 729,000 barrels to 223 million,
the highest level since April 30. Stockpiles of distillate fuel,
including heating oil and diesel, rose 2.2 million barrels to
169.7 million, the highest since the week ended Oct. 16.  
 OPEC Shipments  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
reduce shipments this month as refineries close for maintenance,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  
 The 12-member group, which pumps 40 percent of the world’s
crude, will ship 23.33 million barrels a day in the four weeks
to Aug. 21, down 1.8 percent from 23.75 million barrels a day in
the month ended July 24, the Halifax, England-based consultant
said yesterday. The data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  
 The U.S. reduced its forecast for the 2010 Atlantic
hurricane period to 14 to 20 named storms, down from 14 to 23,
because of less activity than expected in the first two months
of the season. Tropical Storm Colin strengthened over the
Atlantic and may pass to the west of Bermuda within two days,
the National Hurricane Center said.
