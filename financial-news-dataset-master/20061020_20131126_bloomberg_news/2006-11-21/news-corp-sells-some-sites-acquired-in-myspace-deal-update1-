             News Corp. (NWSA) , the media company headed
by  Rupert Murdoch , sold some Web sites it acquired last year as
part of its purchase of MySpace.com to Demand Media Inc.  
 The sale of units including Cases Ladder Inc. and Social
Labs LLC and 20 Web sites such as Grab.com and GameRival.com
closed on Nov. 17, News Corp. said today in an e-mailed
statement. Terms of the sale weren't disclosed.  
 ``These assets weren't vital to our long-term plan,'' Ann
Burkart, a spokeswoman for Fox Interactive Media, News Corp.'s
Internet unit, said in the statement.  
 News Corp. bought MySpace's parent company Intermix Network
LLC in October 2005 for $580 million. Privately held Demand Media
owns Web sites and domain names.  
 Shares of New York-based News Corp. fell 14 cents to $20.96
at 4 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite  trading . They have
gained 35 percent this year.
