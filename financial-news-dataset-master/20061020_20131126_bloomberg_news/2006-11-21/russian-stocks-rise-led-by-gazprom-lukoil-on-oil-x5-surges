             Russian stocks advanced for the
first time in three days. OAO Gazprom and OAO Lukoil, the
country's biggest natural-gas and oil companies, gained with the
price of crude in New York.  
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world's biggest nickel miner,
and  X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE) , Russia's biggest supermarket company,
also increased.  
 The dollar-denominated RTS Index climbed 1.3 percent to
1699.31 at the close of trading in Moscow, the biggest one-day
gain in almost two weeks. The ruble-based Micex Index advanced
1.3 percent to 1509.87.  
 Gazprom, Russia's natural-gas export monopoly, added 2.5
percent to $10.97. Lukoil, the country's biggest oil producer,
climbed 2.5 percent to $84.65.  
 Crude oil rose after the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System
limited the amount of oil it will carry and a North Sea platform
was shut because of a gas leak. Crude oil for January delivery
advanced 1.1 percent to $59.44 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  
 ``The Russian market has lately been driven almost entirely
by the oil price, and today is no different,'' said John Heisel,
a trader at Moscow-based Sovlink Securities. ``We see crude up
slightly on speculation supply will tighten, and speculative
money is piling into liquid oil names, pushing our market up.''  
 Norilsk Nickel Gains  
 Shares of Norilsk Nickel,  Russia 's biggest mining company,
gained 2.2 percent to $142.50. Norilsk Nickel agreed to buy OM
Group Inc.'s nickel unit yesterday for $408 million in cash.  
 Norilsk's existing nickel plants are in Russia. The OMG
deal will give it manufacturing plants in  Finland . They include
the Harjavalta refinery with an annual production capacity of
60,000 tons of nickel, and mining assets in Western  Australia 
that supply raw material to the Finnish plant.  
 X5 Retail Group jumped 6 percent to a record $25.65 in
 London , the biggest one-day gain in a month. The company's sales
may more than double from expected 2.2 billion euros ($2.8
billion) this year to 4.7 billion euros in 2008 on expansion in
Russian regions, UBS AG wrote in a report released today.  
 The retailer said today that it finished buying OOO
Metronom AG, which operates the 16-store Merkado chain in Moscow
and owns the right to the Merkadonna brand name. The $200
million purchase will take the company's number of stores in
Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan to 1,126, the St.Petersburg-based
company said Oct. 13.  
 Shares of OAO Seventh Continent, a Russian supermarket
chain, fell 2.4 percent to 670.82 rubles on the Micex Stock
Exchange. The company said that profit rose 45 percent in the
first nine months to $45.9 million as the company opened more
stores and lured more customers. Sales advanced 36 percent to
$669.6 million, less than the $679 million median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of four analysts.
