             The Vancouver Canucks reached the
second round of the National Hockey League playoffs with a 4-2
victory over the Los Angeles Kings.  
 Daniel Sedin scored with 2:03 remaining in Los Angeles to
break a 2-2 tie as the Canucks took their third game in a row to
win the best-of-seven first-round series 4-2.  
 Vancouver erased a 2-1 third-period deficit and is the
second team from the Western Conference after the top-seeded San
Jose Sharks to advance in the playoffs.  
 The Canucks are the third seed in the West.  
 The Phoenix Coyotes beat the Detroit Red Wings 5-2
yesterday to force a decisive seventh game in their series.  
 Radim Vrbata and Wojtek Wolski scored goals for the Coyotes
less than four minutes apart during the second period in Detroit
after the Red Wings had pulled within 2-1.  
 Phoenix, the fourth seed in the Western Conference, will
host Game 7 tomorrow.  
 The Washington Capitals, the top seed in the East, can
advance to the second round with a win today in Montreal. The
Canadiens trail 3-2 in the series.  
 Also today, the Boston Bruins host the Buffalo Sabres in
the East, while the Chicago Blackhawks visit the Nashville
Predators in the Western Conference. The Bruins and the
Blackhawks lead their series 3-2.
