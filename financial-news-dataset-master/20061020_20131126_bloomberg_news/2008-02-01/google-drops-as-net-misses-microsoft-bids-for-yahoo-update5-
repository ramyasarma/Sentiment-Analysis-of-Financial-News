             Google Inc. (GOOG) , the most popular Web
search engine, fell the most since it went public after fourth-quarter profit missed estimates, signaling investors have soured
on one of the fastest-rising technology stocks of the decade.  
 Google lost $48.40, or 8.6 percent, to $515.90 at 4 p.m.
 New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the biggest drop
since its August 2004 initial public offering. The decline,
which dropped Google from the 20 biggest U.S. companies by
market capitalization, came the same day Microsoft Corp. bid
$44.6 billion for  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , Google's closest rival.  
 Sales growth of 52 percent wasn't enough for some
investors, who had watched Google beat profit estimates in 11 of
the previous 13 quarters. An economic slowdown and a drop in
online traffic may be crimping ad spending. Google also received
less money than expected from ad deals with social-networking
sites such as News Corp.'s MySpace.  
 ``You've seen the peak in the pace of growth,'' said
analyst  Clayton Moran  of Stanford Group Corp. in Boca Raton,
 Florida . ``They're probably not going to be able to repeat the
60, 70, 80 percent growth rates that they had in the past.''  
 Today's decline follows the worst month for the stock since
Google's IPO, the biggest technology offering in the past four
years. The stock reached a record high of $741.79 on Nov. 6.  
 Lower Targets  
 Analysts at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. cut their price
targets for the shares after yesterday's report. Jefferies & Co.
dropped its rating to ``hold'' from ``buy.''  
 Fourth-quarter  net income  rose 17 percent to $1.21 billion,
or $3.79 a share, from $1.03 billion, or $3.29 a share, a year
earlier, Google said after the market closed yesterday. That
fell short of the $3.91 average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  
 Sales, excluding revenue passed on to partner sites,
climbed 52 percent to $3.39 billion. Analysts in the Bloomberg
survey predicted $3.45 billion. Excluding stock-based
compensation costs, profit was $4.43 a share, missing the $4.45
estimate of analysts.  
 Google shares closed at their biggest discount ever to
their 200-day moving average. Since its record high on Nov. 6,
the stock is now down 30 percent.  
 Yahoo Deal  
 In bidding for Yahoo, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer
 Steve Ballmer  is attempting the biggest-ever technology takeover
after failing to compete with Google in the market for Internet
search services and advertising, which may almost double to $80
billion by 2010. Google has grown faster than Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft in every quarter since the 2004 IPO
as its search engine won more users.  
 ``A combination of Yahoo and Microsoft will have lots of
money to spend in the battle with Google,'' said Jack Neele, who
helps manage $194 billion, including Yahoo shares, at Robeco NV
in Rotterdam.  
 In 2006, Google forged an agreement with MySpace to provide
online-search and advertising features on the site, the most
visited social-networking service. The deal includes a
guaranteed payment of $900 million over three years from Google
to  News Corp. (NWSA)   
 ``I don't think we have the killer best way to advertise
and monetize social networks yet,'' Google co-founder  Sergey Brin  said yesterday on a conference call with analysts. ``Some
of the things we were working on in Q4 didn't pan out, and there
were some disappointments there.''  
 Microsoft `Pounced'  
 Microsoft saw an opening in that admission, said analyst
Brian Bolan of Jackson Securities LLC in  Chicago .  
 ``Microsoft sees the Google challenge in this space as a
weakness and has pounced,'' he wrote in a note to investors.
``They believe the recent weakness in Google makes this the best
time to get the deal done.''  
 Rising energy costs and a housing slump pushed down
 consumer confidence  to almost a two-year low in January,
according to the Conference Board. Google  investors  are
concerned that customers may respond by cutting their ad
budgets. The number of U.S. Internet queries dropped 3.9 percent
in December, according to research firm ComScore Inc.  
 ``There is no evidence to date of an economic slowdown,''
Google Chief Executive Officer  Eric Schmidt  said in an interview
yesterday. ``If there were, we would be pretty well
positioned.''  
 Market Share  
 The company's share of the U.S. Internet search market rose
to 56.3 percent in December from 50.8 percent at the end of
2006, while Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo's share fell,
according to Nielsen Online.  
 Google accounted for 75 percent of U.S. search advertising
in 2007, up from 60 percent in 2006, according to New York-based
research firm EMarketer Inc.  
 The company also is seeking to bring advertisers to its
YouTube video site. Google began letting marketers buy ads in
YouTube clips last year. Last month, YouTube opened up its
complete library of homemade clips and television shows to
mobile-phone users.  
 YouTube is seeing ``strong user growth,'' Brin said on the
call. The site is now available in 17 languages.  
 Google also started selling ads on Web sites designed for
mobile phones. In 10 to 20 years, most Internet searches will be
on mobile devices, Schmidt said.
