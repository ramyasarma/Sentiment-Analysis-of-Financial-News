             Grafton Group Plc (GFTU) , Ireland's biggest
builders' merchant, fell the most in more than a month on concern
that property markets are cooling in Ireland and the U.K.  
 Shares of Grafton, which is expanding in the U.K. to avoid
over-reliance on its home market, fell 4.5 percent to 7.21
euros in Dublin, giving the company a market value of 1.7
billion euros ($2.47 billion).  
 Irish housing registrations, a proxy for housing starts,
fell by two thirds in October from a year earlier, Dublin-based
 Goodbody Stockbrokers  said in a report yesterday.  Bovis Homes
Group Plc (BVS) , the U.K.'s sixth-largest homebuilder, said today
home sales will fall this year.  
 ``The decline in registrations points to a pull back in
supply by builders in response to a more reluctant buyer
market, which in turn is encouraged to defer purchases as  house
prices  decline,'' said John Sheehan, an analyst at NCB
Stockbrokers, in a note.  
 Grafton, which fell the most since Sept. 25, was the
fifth-worst performer on the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index of
Europe's largest publicly traded companies today.
