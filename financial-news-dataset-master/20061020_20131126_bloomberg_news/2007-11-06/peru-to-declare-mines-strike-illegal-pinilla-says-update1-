             Peru 's government will declare a two-
day national mining strike illegal today, forcing miners to
return to work or lose their jobs, Labor Minister Susana Pinilla
said.  
 The strike, which seeks to pressure companies to improve
pensions, profit-sharing and rights for subcontracted workers,
is ``politically motivated,'' Pinilla told Lima-based CPN Radio.  
 ``Union leaders have a different stance that has nothing to
do with worker vindication,'' Pinilla said. ``They have led
workers into an illegal strike where they could lose their
jobs.''  
 Strikes this year, including a five-day national
walkout by Peruvian miners in May, have cut copper output
in Peru, Chile and  Mexico , helping to spur a 17 percent
rally in the price of the metal. Peru is the world's third-
largest producer of copper, zinc and tin, the biggest of
silver and fifth-largest of gold.  
 The stoppage in Peru has affected mines owned by companies
including  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) ,  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX) ,  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  and Doe Run Resources Corp.  
 Workers also are on strike at mines run by Cia. De Minas
Buenaventura SA, tin miner  Minsur SA (MINSURI1) , Shougang Hierroperu's iron
mine and zinc producers Cia. Minera Raura SA and Cia. Minera
Santa Luisa, according to Mining Federation spokesman Cirilo Yarihuaman.  
 Talks Planned  
 Southern Copper's Peruvian mines, where 20 percent of
workers went on strike, don't expect production losses, parent
 Grupo Mexico  said in a filing to the Mexican Stock Exchange.  
 National metals output hasn't been cut and only 6,300
workers, or 5.3 percent of Peru's miners, are on strike, Pinilla
said. The Mining Federation put the number at 45,000.  
 Union leaders planned to hold talks with Cabinet chief
Jorge del Castillo and the president of Congress, Luis Gonzales Posada, to pass laws granting miners a 10 percent share of
profits, up from the current 8 percent, and eight-hour shifts
instead of the 12 hours imposed at many mines, Yarihuaman said.  
 The federation, which represents 70 unions and 28,000
miners, also wants 85,000 subcontracted workers put on company
payrolls.  
 Copper futures for December delivery rose 3.95 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $3.3415 a pound on the Comex division of the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. Zinc rose $95, or 3.5 percent, to
$2,820 a metric ton in  London  trading, and tin rose $345, or 2.1
percent, to $17,095 a ton.  
 Silver for December delivery rose 59.5 cents, or 4 percent,
to $15.38 an ounce. Gold for December delivery rose $12.60, or
1.6 percent, to $823.40 an ounce.  
 ``The strike in  Latin America  is quite supportive to
prices,''  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in
London, said today by phone.
