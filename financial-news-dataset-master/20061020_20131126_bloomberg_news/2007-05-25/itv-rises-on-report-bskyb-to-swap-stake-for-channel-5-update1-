             Shares of  ITV Plc (ITV) , the U.K.'s biggest
commercial broadcaster, rose the most in more than six months
after a report said  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  is in
talks to swap its 17.9 percent stake in ITV for a controlling
stake in Channel Five held by Bertelsmann AG's RTL Group.  
 ITV shares rose 4.5 pence, or 3.9 percent, to 119.1 pence in
 London , the biggest gain since November 2006.  
 BSkyB is in ``ongoing'' talks to swap its ITV stake for a
holding in RTL's Channel Five, Channel Four reported on its Web
site, citing ``senior sources.'' BSkyB bought the ITV stake in
November for about 940 million pounds ($1.87 billion).  
 ITV spokesman Jim Godfrey, BSkyB spokesman Stephen Gaynor
and RTL spokesman Oliver Herrgesell all declined to comment.  
 Should BSkyB succeed in swapping its stake in ITV for
control of Channel Five it will be one of the biggest deals in
British broadcasting history, Channel Four said.  
 When BSkyB bought the stake in ITV it blocked a potential
takeover of ITV by cable TV company NTL Inc., now called Virgin
Media Inc. Virgin Media has complained about BSkyB's influence in
the media.  
 Shares of BSkyB, chaired by  Rupert Murdoch , rose 5.5 pence
to 640 pence, and RTL shares fell 1.4 percent to 86.25 euros in
Luxembourg. Closely held Bertelsmann, based in Guetersloh,
 Germany , owns 90 percent of RTL and is Europe's largest media
company.
