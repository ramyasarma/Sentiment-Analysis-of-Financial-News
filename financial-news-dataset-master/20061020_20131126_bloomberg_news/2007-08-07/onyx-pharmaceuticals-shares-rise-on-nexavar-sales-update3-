             Shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.
rose 8 percent after the company's German partner, Bayer AG,
reported a surge in sales of the kidney-cancer drug Nexavar.  
 The price of a  share  increased $2.49, or 8.1 percent, to
$33.31 at 4 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading. The stock has tripled this year, gaining the most in
the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Nexavar sales increased 150 percent in the second quarter
to $81.3 million, Onyx said in a statement today after markets
closed. The drug was approved by U.S. regulators in December
2005 for kidney cancer, and the companies asked U.S. and
European regulators in June to approve the drug for  liver
cancer . Data presented at a medical meeting that month showed
Nexavar was the first drug to improve survival for patients with
liver cancer.  
 Onyx, of Emeryville,  California , and Bayer each take half
the profits from Nexavar worldwide, with the exception of Japan,
where Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer takes a greater share,
Onyx has said. Bayer reported earnings earlier today.
