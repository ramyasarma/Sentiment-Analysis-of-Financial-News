South Africa posted a budget deficit
of 27 billion rand ($4.1 billion) in November compared with 23.5
billion rand a year ago, the National Treasury said.  Government revenue rose an annual 8.5 percent to 43.6
billion rand, while spending increased 11 percent to 70.5
billion rand, the Pretoria-based National Treasury said on its
website today.  Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said in his mid-term budget
on Oct. 27 that tax receipts for the year through March will
probably be 31 billion rand higher than previously forecast as
the economy recovers from last year’s recession. That will
enable him to trim the budget deficit to 5.3 percent of gross
domestic product, compared with 6.2 percent estimated in
February.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
