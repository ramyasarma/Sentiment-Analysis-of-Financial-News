Philippine President Benigno Aquino
said Hong Kong’s planned inquiry of witnesses on the August bus
siege that killed at least eight tourists is better done in the
country as “the issue of sovereignty and the protection of our
citizens is paramount.”  The Philippine government will “have to study the
parameters” of the planned Hong Kong probe, Aquino told
reporters today in Manila. “I don’t know if there’s a need” to
send witnesses to Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
