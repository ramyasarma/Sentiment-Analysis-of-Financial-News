The Australian dollar gained to the
highest since July 1982 against its U.S. counterpart.  The so-called Aussie rose to as much as $1.0195 and traded
at $1.0192 as of 11:59 a.m. in Sydney from $1.0179 in New York
yesterday. In December 1983, the nation stopped pegging the
Aussie to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
