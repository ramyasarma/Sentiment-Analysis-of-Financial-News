Hungary recorded its third
consecutive  current-account surplus  in the third quarter after
the worst recession since 1991 curbed imports and European Union
transfers helped improve the balance.  The surplus was 477 million euros ($631 million), compared
with a revised 584 million euros in the second quarter, the
 Magyar Nemzeti Bank  said today. The median estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 263 million-euro
surplus.  Hungary’s current-account balance has improved after an
 economic contraction  of 6.7 percent last year reduced consumer
demand and companies imported fewer parts and raw materials as
they scaled back output. Growth resumed in the fourth quarter.  Hungary recorded its 21st consecutive monthly trade surplus
in October as recovering growth in western Europe boosted demand
for exports.  In the third quarter, the country posted a surplus on the
trade of goods and services. Direct investment income showed a
deficit of 1.1 trillion euros and current transfers from the
European Union showed a surplus of 312 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
