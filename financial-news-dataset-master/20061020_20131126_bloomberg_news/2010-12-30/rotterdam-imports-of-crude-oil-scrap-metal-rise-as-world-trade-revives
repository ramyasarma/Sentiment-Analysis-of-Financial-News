Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port,
imported 4.2 percent more crude oil in 2010 to feed local
refineries and handled 81 percent more iron ore and scrap metal
as demand strengthened.  Total cargo shipments rose 11 percent to a record 430
million metric tons on increased world trade and economic growth
in Germany, the port said in a  statement  on its website today.
Inbound shipments came to 99.7 million tons of crude and 36.5
million tons of iron ore and scrap.  “Demand in Western Europe for oil products suffered from
the crisis and resulted in closure or production limits for
less-efficient refineries in northern France and northern
Germany,” the port said. “This was to the advantage of the
larger and more flexible refineries in Rotterdam. Demand for
steel by German carmakers in particular increased strongly.”  A revival in global trade is bolstering port traffic as
economies rebound from recessions. The Belgian port of Antwerp
this week predicted a 13 percent gain in cargo-handling for
2010, and shipments through Rouen, France’s main grain-shipping
hub, climbed to a record between Jan. 1 and Nov. 29.  Steel, Coal  The outlook for Rotterdam in 2011 is “moderately
positive,” according to the statement, with cargo-handling
predicted to climb between 2 percent and 3 percent to about 440
million tons. “Despite price increases for raw materials,
somewhat larger production of iron and steel is expected.”  Coal will be a “structural growth product” next year
because of mine closings in Germany, with shipments forecast to
rise to between 25 million and 26 million tons from 24 million
tons this year, the port said.  The volume of incoming liquid-bulk cargoes rose 4 percent
to 162 million tons this year, boosted by imports of crude.
Handling of agricultural commodities remained stable at 8.4
million tons, the statement shows.  “The European harvest year 2009-2010 was good, and that
always weighs on imports via Rotterdam,” the port said. “The
harvest year 2010-2011 is clearly worse, and that immediately
stimulated imports in the last quarter of 2010.”  Rotterdam, located at the mouth of the Rhine and Meuse
rivers, was the world’s third-largest port in 2008 after
Singapore and Shanghai, based on a  ranking  by the American
Association of Port Authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
