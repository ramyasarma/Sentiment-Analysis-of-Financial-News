Cattle futures fell the most in
three weeks on speculation that U.S. meatpackers will buy fewer
animals as profit margins shrink. Hogs also declined.  Wholesale choice-beef prices are up 1 percent since Dec.
17, trailing a 6.3 percent jump in the price meatpackers pay
for spot-market cattle,  U.S. Department  of Agriculture data
show. Packers shipped an estimated 11.28 million pounds of
choice beef in the first three days of this week, down 17
percent from a week earlier, according to the USDA.  Meatpacker “needs for next week should be limited, due to
poor margins,” said Doug Houghton, an analyst with Brock
Associates in  Milwaukee . “Even with the beef market going up,
margins were still weakened, with cattle prices going up
more.”  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.925 cent, or
0.9 percent, to settle at $1.07325 a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange. That marked the biggest loss since
Dec. 7.  Futures have added 25 percent this year, heading for the
biggest annual gain since 1978.  Choice beef climbed to $1.6341 a pound at midday, while
spot-market cattle sold for $1.0626 yesterday, compared with
99.94 cents on Dec. 17, according to government statistics.  “Beef prices have been really strong, but I question a
little on the product-movement side,” said Chad Henderson, a
market analyst with Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “At some point, the consumer is going
to say enough is enough.”  Feeder Cattle  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped 1.15
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.22925 a pound. Earlier, the price
reached $1.2495, the highest since the commodity started
trading in November 1971. The price is up 28 percent this year.  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.75 cent, or 0.9
percent, to 78.85 cents a pound, paring this year’s increase to
20 percent. That would be the biggest annual gain since 2004.  Wholesale pork was little changed yesterday at 76.81 cents
a pound, down 1.1 percent this week. Spot-market hogs in  Iowa 
and southern  Minnesota , the largest producing region, surged
5.4 percent to 73.5 cents a pound, the highest since Oct. 6.  The CME’s livestock trading will  close  at 12 p.m. Chicago
time tomorrow for the New Year’s Eve holiday, the exchange
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
