Italian  business confidence  rose for
a third month to the highest in almost three years as executives
shared consumers’ optimism about the  economic recovery .  The  Isae  institute’s manufacturing-sentiment index climbed
to 103, the highest since February 2008, from a revised 101.7 in
November, the research center said in a statement from Rome
today. Economists had predicted a reading of 102, according to
the  median  of 15 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  This month’s “increase is mainly due to a further
improvement in the views on orders and demand,” Isae said in
today’s report. “There is a new stock depletion, while
production levels are basically holding up.”  Household confidence  rose in December to an 11-month high
as the economy expanded and unemployment fell in the third
quarter. Growing exports helped boost Italy’s  gross domestic
product  0.3 percent in the three months through September, more
than the 0.2 percent initially reported, while the  jobless rate  
fell in the same period to 8.3 percent, less than the 10.1
percent average for the euro region in October.  Turin-based utility  Iren SpA  on Dec. 13 forecast gross
operating profit of 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion) by 2015,
with annual growth of 10 percent and total investments of 2.4
billion euros.  Indesit Company SpA , Italy’s biggest home-
appliance maker, in 2011 will invest about twice the average of
the past few years in new high-end products, Chief Executive
Officer  Marco Milani  told daily Il Sole 24 Ore on Dec. 22.  Fiat SpA , Italy’s biggest manufacturer, reached a final
accord with workers at a plant in Pomigliano, near Naples, which
will produce Panda cars, unions said yesterday. Under the deal,
5,600 employees will be hired in January at the factory.  Growth Forecasts  Italy’s rebound from its worst slump since World War II may
lose pace as falling global demand limits exports and consumer
spending remains weak. The $2.3 trillion economy will grow 1
percent this year, less than the 1.2 percent estimated in
September, employers’ lobby  Confindustria  said on Dec. 16. The
forecast compares with 2010 growth of 1.2 percent  projected  by
the Finance Ministry in September.  Italian business confidence mirrored optimism among
executives in Europe’s biggest economy. The Munich-based  Ifo
institute  said on Dec. 17 that its  business-climate index 
unexpectedly increased to the highest since records for a
reunified Germany began in 1991. The recovery in the euro-region
also strengthened last month amid growing optimism about the
economic outlook, the  Eurocoin index  showed on Nov. 26.  Isae polled 4,000 companies between Dec. 1 and Dec. 17. The
research center had originally reported business confidence at
101.6 in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
