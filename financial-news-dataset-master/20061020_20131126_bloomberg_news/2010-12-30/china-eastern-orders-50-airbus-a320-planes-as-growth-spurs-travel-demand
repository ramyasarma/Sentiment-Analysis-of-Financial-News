China Eastern Airlines Corp., the
nation’s second-largest carrier, agreed to buy 50 Airbus SAS
A320 planes as economic growth boosted travel demand.  The single-aisle planes, to be delivered from 2012 to 2015,
would cost a total of $3.2 billion at 2005 list prices, the
Shanghai-based company said today in a statement. The airline
said it will pay a “significantly” lower price.  The new planes will expand the carrier’s group fleet about
11 percent and support the introduction of more domestic and
regional routes from its hub in China’s financial capital, China
Eastern said. The airline’s passenger numbers rose 47 percent in
the first 11 months of this year helped by the global economic
pick-up and the acquisition of neighbor Shanghai Airlines Co.  Airbus has boosted its presence in China through the
opening of an A320 assembly line in Tianjin, its first outside
of Europe. The Toulouse, France-based planemaker last month
announced an order for 102 planes from China, including 50
A320s. Half the A320s will be built in China, it said at the
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
