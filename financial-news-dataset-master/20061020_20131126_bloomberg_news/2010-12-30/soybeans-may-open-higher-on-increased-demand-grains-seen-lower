What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that dry weather in
Argentina may increase demand for U.S. oilseeds, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in Minneapolis. Soybean-meal futures may open steady to $1
higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open up
0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago as investment demand may slow after a 15 percent surge
in prices this month, Schultz said.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 9 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on speculation that snow in the central U.S.
Great Plains will provide moisture for dry fields and protect
plants from colder weather, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
