Copper climbed to records in New
York and London after U.S. businesses grew at the fastest pace
in two decades and Chinese manufacturing expanded, signaling
robust demand.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said
today its business barometer rose to 68.6 this month, the
highest level since July 1988. A purchasing managers’ index in
China was 54.4 in December, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. Figures over 50 signal expansion. China and
the U.S. are the world’s biggest copper users.  “The trend is on for higher prices” as the economy
accelerates and demand rises, said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “It’s
supply concerns that set up this whole bull run.”.  Copper futures for March delivery rose 5.1 cents, or 1.2
percent, to close at $4.3625 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. Earlier, the price jumped to an all-time high of
$4.379.  Global inventories are down 19 percent this year, heading
for the biggest annual decline since 2004, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Stockpiles will continue to drop next year as supplies
fall short of demand by 825,000 metric tons, Barclays Capital
said in a report on Dec. 22. The shortage this year is
estimated at 449,000 tons, the bank said.  Prices have jumped 30 percent this year. Copper is used in
homes, electrical grids and appliances.  “I saw more construction than ever” in China during a
trip in November,  Jay Goldstein , the president of Montreal-
based Lorbec Metals Ltd., said today in an e-mail.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $95, or 1 percent, to $9,495 a ton ($4.31 a
pound), after reaching a record $9,550.  Nickel and zinc also gained on the LME. Aluminum, lead and
tin fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
