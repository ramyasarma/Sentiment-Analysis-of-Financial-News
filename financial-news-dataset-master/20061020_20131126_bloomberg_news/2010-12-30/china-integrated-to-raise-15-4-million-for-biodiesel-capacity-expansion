said in a statement yesterday. This is a 1 percent discount to
its last closing price. It didn’t name the investors.  The company plans to use the proceeds to expand its
biodiesel production capacity and to fund operations for
wholesale distribution of finished oil and heavy oil products,
it said.  CIE operates a 100,000 ton biodiesel production plant in
