The U.K. pound was near a five-week
low against the euro as investors reduced positions at the end
of the year and lower trading volumes exaggerated price changes.  Sterling declined for the third day in four against the
dollar, as foreign-exchange strategists, including  Geoffrey Yu 
at UBS AG in London, said a lack of data made the currency
vulnerable to trade fluctuations.  The moves are down to “last-minute book squaring and
balance-sheet management,” said  Michael Derks , the head of
currency strategy at FXPro Financial Services in London, who
said trading has been thin during the holiday period. “It’s
more year-end flows rather than anything fundamental, month-end
and year-end flows have been the main drivers.”  The British currency weakened 0.5 percent to 85.77 pence
per euro, as of 10:43 a.m. in London after earlier strengthening
0.2 percent to 85.19 pence per euro. It touched 85.93 pence per
euro on Dec. 28, the weakest since Nov. 22. Sterling depreciated
0.3 percent to $1.5460.  To contact the reporter on this story:
