Burundian lawmakers unanimously
approved the East African nation’s 2011 budget, which calls for
a 19 percent increase in spending that will be mainly directed
toward the coffee-growing nation’s agriculture industry.  Spending will grow to 1.03 trillion Burundian francs ($835
million) next year from 863.1 billion francs in 2009, Finance
Minister  Clotilde Nizigama  told lawmakers in parliament on Dec.
28. Revenue was forecast to climb 26 percent to 432.6 billion
francs, she said.  Funding from donors is expected to increase 31 percent to
469.1 billion francs in the year ahead, Nizigama said. Spending
on the agriculture industry will more than double to 36.3
billion francs, she said.  Coffee sales account for two-thirds of Burundi’s exports
and the industry is the main source of income for about 800,000
households in one of the world’s poorest nations, according to
the International Monetary Fund. Growth in the East African
nation is expected to accelerate to 4.5 percent in 2011 and 4.8
percent in 2012, from an estimated 3.9 percent this year, the
IMF said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
