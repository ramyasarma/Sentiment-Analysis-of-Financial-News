The U.K. pound weakened to its
lowest level in seven weeks against the euro after a report
showed house prices fell and economists forecast they may
decline further next year as austerity measures kick in.  Sterling depreciated against all 16 of its most traded
peers and dropped for the third day in four against the dollar.
The Land Registry said the cost of buying a house slid 0.6
percent in November from a month earlier. A Bloomberg survey
showed home prices will drop next year, extending a decline that
began in the third quarter.  “Most of the data on the U.K. housing market recently has
been on the soft side,” said  Holger Schmieding , chief economist
at Joh Berenberg Gossler & Co. in London. “We have thin holiday
trading, so small triggers in terms of significance, can make
markets move.”  The British currency weakened 1.1 percent to 86.22 pence
per euro, as of 4:33 p.m. in London, after touching 86.33 pence
per euro, its weakest level since Nov. 10. Sterling depreciated
0.7 percent to $1.5395. The pound has fallen 4.5 percent over
the past month and 7.8 percent over the year, according to
Bloomberg correlation-weighted currency indexes, which measure
the currencies of 10 developed nations.  U.K. home prices will fall about 2.5 percent next year, as
mortgage restrictions and government spending cuts discourage
buyers, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “Buyers remain tentative about the impact of government
spending cuts and the prospect of unemployment in 2011,” said
 David Newnes , managing director of LSL Property Services Plc’s
chain of residential-property brokers.  The 10-year gilt yield fell nine basis points to 3.47
percent. The 4.75 percent security maturing in March 2020 gained
0.76, or 7.6 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 109.98. The
two-year note yield was down eight basis points at 1.16 percent.  Gilts returned 6.2 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained 5.7 percent and
German debt, the euro-area’s benchmark securities, returned 6.0
percent, the EFFAS indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
