Treasuries headed for the steepest
monthly loss among the world’s major bond markets on prospects
U.S. reports on housing and employment will add to signs that
economic growth will gain momentum.  Global bonds dropped for a fourth month on speculation
gross domestic product growth will increase worldwide in 2011,
leading equities to outperform debt. The  difference  between
yields on U.S. 10-year  notes  and Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices
over the life of the securities, widened to 2.28 percentage
points from this year’s low of 1.47 percentage points in August.  “People had better wait to buy” Treasuries, said  Tsutomu Komiya , who handles U.S. debt in Tokyo for Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $105.8 billion
and is part of Japan’s second-biggest brokerage. “We will see
good economic numbers” in 2011.  U.S. 10-year notes yielded 3.35 percent as of 12:20 p.m. in
Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent
security due November 2020 traded at a price of 93 30/32. The
yield will climb to 3.6 percent by the end of March, Komiya said.  Treasuries due in more than a year handed investors a 2.1
percent loss in December, according to figures compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. It is the worst performance of 26 sovereign indexes.  The  index  of pending home sales rose 0.8 percent in
November after jumping a record 10 percent in October,
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the National
Association of Realtors will report today.  Other data may show initial jobless claims dropped last
week, a separate survey showed before today’s data.  Treasuries gained yesterday after the government’s $29
billion auction of seven-year notes produced the highest demand
from a group of investors including foreign central banks since
June 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
