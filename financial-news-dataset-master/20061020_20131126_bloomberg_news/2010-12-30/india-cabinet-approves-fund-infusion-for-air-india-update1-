India’s Cabinet Committee on
Economic Affairs  approved  an infusion of 12 billion rupees ($267
million) in Air India Ltd., the operator of the nation’s flag
carrier, in an attempt to turn around the money losing airline.  The Cabinet panel also directed the state-owned airline’s
management to rationalize wage structures, the Ministry of Civil
Aviation said in a statement today.  The fund infusion comes as the airline is seeking to expand
its fleet to connect more cities and take advantage of an
increasing number of Indians opting to travel by air as economic
growth boosts incomes in Asia’s third-biggest economy. Air India
has struggled to wipe out losses since it was formed in 2007 by
combining the state-owned domestic and international carriers.  Passengers carried by domestic airlines increased 19
percent to 46.8 million in the 11 months ended Nov. 30, compared
with a 5.5 percent pace in the year-earlier period, according to
the Ministry of Civil Aviation.  Domestic air traffic may surge fourfold to 180 million
passengers annually by 2020, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said
July 3. Boeing Co. in August raised its 20-year forecast for
Indian aircraft demand by 15 percent and said the nation’s air
travelers may climb to a record 50 million this year from 44
million in 2009.  Market Share  Air India has lost market share as the number of domestic
passengers has increased. The airline’s market share declined to
17.1 percent in November from 18.8 percent in the same month
last year, according to data provided by the ministry.  The airline aims to improve its on-time performance to 93
percent from 60.6 percent in November, increase revenue from
flying passengers to 350 billion rupees and non-passenger
revenue to 65 billion rupees, according to a  statement  from the
civil aviation ministry in July 25.  The state-run airline plans to expand its fleet to as many
as 286 aircraft and connect 60 major cities, the ministry said
in July. The airline has 135 passenger planes and nine cargo
jets, according to its  website .  Air India has proposed to restructure working capital loans
through sale of bonds guaranteed by the government with longer
tenure, sell or lease real estate and buildings it owns and
expand equity through infusion by the government, the ministry
said in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
