Gold futures fell for the first time
this week on investor sales following this year’s rally. Silver
declined from a 30-year peak, and palladium dropped from the
highest since 2001.  In 2010, gold has gained 28 percent, headed for a 10th
straight annual gain and outpacing stocks and bonds. The metal
reached a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7 as physical
bullion held in exchange-traded products surged.  “Gold has had an exceptional run,” said  Frank McGhee , the
head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.
“People are just scoring up for the end of the year.”  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for February
delivery fell $7.60, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $1,405.90 at
1:59 p.m. The metal gained 2.4 percent in the previous three
days.  “Short-term traders have been active, and you’re seeing
some end-of-the-year profit-taking,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader
at FuturePath Trading in Chicago. “What has really driven the
price this year is that gold has emerged as an alternative to
foreign currencies and government paper.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark interest
rate at zero percent to 0.25 percent and plans to buy $600
billion in bonds through June. Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
helped drive gold priced in euros and British pounds to all-time
highs yesterday.  ‘Regained Ground’  Silver futures for March delivery fell 19.1 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $30.513 an ounce. Earlier, the metal reached $30.93,
the highest in 30 years. This year, the price has jumped 81
percent, the second-biggest gain among 19 raw materials in the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  “Silver this year has regained much of the ground it lost
to gold during the beginning of the financial crisis,” McGhee
of Integrated said.  Silver dropped 24 percent in 2008 and climbed 49 percent in
2009.  Palladium futures for March delivery dropped $7.20, or 0.9
percent, to $786.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price advanced to $799, the highest since
March 2001.  Platinum futures for April delivery fell $10.90, or 0.6
percent, $1,749.30 an ounce.  Palladium has surged 92 percent this year, and platinum is
up 19 percent. The metals are used in jewelry and pollution-
control devices in vehicles.  “Palladium has been really bid up because of demand for
expanding economies in Asia,” Lesh of FuturePath said.  This year, cotton has jumped 90 percent, the biggest gain
among CRB components. Palladium isn’t included in the gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
