Corn futures fell, halting the
longest rally since 2008, and soybeans declined on speculation
that demand will ease after prices jumped to 28-month highs this
week.  Corn surged 49 percent this year and soybeans are up 31
percent as adverse weather reduced global inventories and
increased demand for U.S. supplies. Some investors may shift
money into equities on signs that the global economy will
expand.  “The risk-to-reward ratio favors people taking money out
of commodities before the end of the tax year,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for AgriVisor LLC in
Bloomington.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 8 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $6.16 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the first decline since Dec. 15. The nine-
session rally was the longest since April 2008. Yesterday, the
grain reached $6.265, the highest since August 2008.  Corn has gained 13 percent this month amid forecasts that
U.S. inventories before next year’s harvest will decline to the
lowest since 1996.  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped 1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $13.76 a bushel. The price has climbed 11 percent
this month on record Chinese demand for supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter.  The oilseed is heading for the biggest annual gain since
2007. On Dec. 28, the price reached $13.9675, the highest since
August 2008.  Adverse Weather  Agricultural commodities, including cotton, wheat, sugar
and coffee, led a rally in raw materials in the second half of
2010 after a drought in Russia, floods in  Australia  and
unfavorable weather in  Brazil , Canada and the U.S. slashed crop
production. Food prices jumped in  China ,  India  and other
emerging markes.  Since the end of June, the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials has gained 27 percent, heading for the
biggest advance for a second half since the gauge debuted in
late 1956.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
