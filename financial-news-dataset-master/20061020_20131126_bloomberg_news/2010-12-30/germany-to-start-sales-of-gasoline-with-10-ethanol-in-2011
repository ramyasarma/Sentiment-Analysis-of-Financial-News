Germany is starting sales of
gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol at the start of next
year.  The fuel will be sold under the name Super E10, Thomas
Hagbeck, a spokesman at the Environment Ministry, said by phone
from Berlin.  The European Union has pushed for a proportion of motor
fuel to come from renewable sources led by biofuels as it seeks
to reduce carbon emissions. Germany has a 6.25 percent target,
which oil companies can meet by adding vegetable oils including
rapeseed oil to diesel or ethanol to gasoline.  All retailers should have Super E10 by the end of the first
quarter, Klaus Picard, head of Mineraloelwirtschaftsverband, the
country’s petroleum association, said by phone from Berlin.  The 6.25 percent figure is a measure of energy content. To
meet that target on gasoline, 10 percent of ethanol by volume
must be added to the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
