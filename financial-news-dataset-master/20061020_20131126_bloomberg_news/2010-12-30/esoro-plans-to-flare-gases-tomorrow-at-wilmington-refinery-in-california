Tesoro Corp. , the largest
independent refiner in the Western U.S., plans to flare gases
tomorrow at its  Wilmington  plant in California, according to a
filing with state regulators.  The flaring isn’t related to a breakdown, the  filing  with
the South Coast Air Quality Management District showed. Flaring,
the release of gases into the air, is a safety measure that
prevents excess pressure from building up when processing units
are stopping or starting.  Tesoro was scheduled to flare from yesterday to today,
according to a Dec. 28 filing with the regulator. The San
Antonio-based company planned to start a unit following
maintenance, it said the same day.  The refinery has capacity to process about 104,000 barrels
of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
