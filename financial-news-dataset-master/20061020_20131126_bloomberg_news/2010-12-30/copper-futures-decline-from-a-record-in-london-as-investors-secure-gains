Copper, trading little changed in
London, may decline as investors sold the metal to lock in gains
after it jumped to a record yesterday. Aluminum, zinc and lead
dropped.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded at
$9,394.25 a metric ton by 10:07 a.m. Singapore time, after
falling 0.2 percent earlier. It reached an all-time high of
$9,447 a ton yesterday and is up 27 percent this year, poised
for a second annual increase.  “Consolidation is healthy for the market given the
exceptional run this year,” said Jiangsu Holly Futures
Brokerage Co. analyst Lu Wei. “A bit of year-end profit-taking
is to be expected but the uptrend hasn’t changed.”  Futures on the Comex in New York were little changed at
$4.3105 a pound after reaching a record $4.3350 this week. The
metal for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
dropped as much as 1 percent to 68,840 yuan ($10,394) a ton.  Inventories  in LME warehouses rose for the 11th straight
session yesterday to the highest level in more than two months.
Still, stockpiles are down 26 percent this year, on course for
the first annual decline since 2004.  Aluminum in London fell 0.3 percent to $2,448 a ton, zinc
decreased 0.6 percent to $2,385 a ton, and lead dropped 0.6
percent to $2,516 a ton. Nickel rose 0.2 percent to $23,900 a
ton, while tin hadn’t traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
