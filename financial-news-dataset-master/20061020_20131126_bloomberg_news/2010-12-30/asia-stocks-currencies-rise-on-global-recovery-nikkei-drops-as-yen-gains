Copper climbed to a record and
shares in emerging markets gained for a third day as Chinese
manufacturing expanded. The  U.S. dollar  weakened after lower-
than-forecast American jobless claims increased demand for
riskier assets.  Copper futures advanced 1.2 percent at the close of
trading, bringing their gain this year to 30 percent. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index advanced 0.8 percent at 4:30 p.m. in  New
York  and has risen 16 percent in the past year. The Dollar Index
fell 0.4 percent, bringing its loss since Dec. 22 to 1.5 percent
and trimming its annual gain to 2.1 percent. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, up 13 percent in 2010, lost 0.2 percent.  Stocks, bonds, commodities and the dollar have risen in
2010, the first time that’s happened since 2005, amid confidence
the global economy will avoid a second recession in three years.
While stocks in developed nations yesterday erased losses caused
by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s 2008 bankruptcy, it took 17
months longer than emerging markets to reach that milestone.
U.S. initial jobless claims fell to the lowest level since July
2008, while Chinese manufacturing growth slowed, easing concern
the government will tighten monetary policy.  “Today’s jobless claims report was a very nice landmark,”
said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in
Philadelphia, which manages $19 billion. “We also got good data
from  China . It’s clear that even as they tighten, there’s no
interest in derailing global growth.”  Copper, Oil  Copper futures rose 1.5 percent and earlier reached a
record $4.379 a pound in New York. China is the largest consumer
of copper. Crude oil slid 1.4 percent to $89.84 a barrel.  The MSCI emerging-markets index climbed to a seven-week
high. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 0.6
percent. Templeton Emerging Markets Group’s  Mark Mobius  said
Chinese shares are poised to rally next year as the government
keeps inflation under control, while  RBC Capital Markets  raised
its 2011 economic growth forecast for the country to 9.5 percent
from 8.8 percent in a report today.    South Korea ’s won led gains in emerging-market currencies,
strengthening 1.2 percent versus the dollar, as  Lee Young Bog , a
Bank of Korea official, forecast the current-account surplus
will widen this month. Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 1.1 percent
against the U.S. currency. The country’s central bank raised its
benchmark interest rate by 0.125 percentage point to 1.625
percent after the close of trading, matching the forecast of all
14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
