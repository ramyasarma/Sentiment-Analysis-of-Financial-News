Businesses in the U.S. expanded in
December at the fastest pace in two decades, adding to evidence
the world’s largest economy is accelerating heading into 2011.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer rose to 68.6 this month, exceeded the
most optimistic forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and the highest level since July 1988. Figures greater than
50 signal expansion.  Gains in business investment on new equipment and growing
exports to emerging economies will keep factories churning out
goods in the coming year, contributing to the recovery. Evidence
that consumer spending is also picking up means retailers will
need to restock shelves, giving manufacturing a further lift.  “The factory sector continues to be one of the consistent
bright spots in the economy,”  Michael Gregory , a senior
economist at BMO Capital Markets Inc. in Toronto, said before
the report. “Businesses are continuing to invest.”  The median forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News projected the gauge would fall to 61. Estimates ranged from
59 to 63.7.  A report today from the Labor Department showed claims for
jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level since July
2008, showing the labor market is improving heading into 2011.
Filings decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Dec.
25, fewer than the lowest estimate of economists surveyed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
