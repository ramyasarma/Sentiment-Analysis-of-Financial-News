The refusal of some shareholders in
 Bharti Airtel Ltd.’s  Zambia unit to sell their securities may
stall the company’s planned delisting, Zambia’s stock exchange
said.  About 2,000 shareholders, owning 3 percent of  Celtel Zambia
Ltd.’s , rejected an offer of 710 kwacha a share (15 cents) from
New Delhi-based Bharti, Beatrice Nkanza, general manager of the
Lusaka-based bourse, said in an interview today.  “We have to look at the interests of the 2,000
shareholders that have refused to sell their shares after Airtel
made a mandatory offer,” she said. “It’s not automatic that
when you make an application to delist it is accepted
immediately. You have to satisfy the laws of Zambia.”  Bharti said on Dec. 24 it planned to delist from the Lusaka
exchange after increasing its stake to 97 percent from 78.9
percent. Trading in the shares was suspended on Aug. 18 after
Bharti bought Zain’s African assets.  According to Zambian regulations, any company that has more
than 50 shareholders must be quoted on the exchange, Nkanza
said.  Bharti’s “announcement was premature and it scared the
minority shareholders that have refused to give up their
shares,” she said. “These are delicate matters that have to be
handled properly by following laws.”  Mwila Katongo, a spokeswoman for Bharti in Zambia, declined
to comment.  Bharti’s unit is the biggest mobile phone operator in the
southern African country, with about 70 percent of the market.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
