Ofcom, Britain’s media regulator,
will probably recommend tomorrow that  Rupert Murdoch ’s bid to
buy the remaining 61 percent of  British Sky Broadcasting Plc , a
pay-TV company, should be subject to a further six-month
inquiry, the Guardian reported.  Ofcom Chief Executive Officer  Ed Richards  will give Culture
Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  the conclusions of a “public interest”
inquiry into whether a buyout by Murdoch’s News Corp. would harm
media plurality in the U.K.; the likelihood is that a further
investigation by the Competition Commission will be recommended,
the newspaper said.  While the decision is Hunt’s, it would be surprising if he
were to deviate from Ofcom’s advice, the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
