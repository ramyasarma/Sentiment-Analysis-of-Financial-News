  Chancellor Angela Merkel  vowed to
defend the euro as “the foundation” of  Germany ’s economy and
called for resolve to bolster the currency.    Europe  is in the midst of a great test,” Merkel said in
an advance text of a New Year’s speech to the nation. “We must
strengthen the euro.”  Merkel and leaders of the other 15 euro members are trying
to forge a so-called permanent crisis mechanism to defend the
currency once an emergency fund set up this year expires in
2013. Pledging guarantees worth 123 billion euros ($163
billion), Germany is the biggest contributor to the 440 billion
euro fund.  The German leader said the euro “is far more than a
currency,” it is “the foundation of our wealth.”  Merkel’s New Year’s speech, which was e-mailed in advance
to reporters, will be broadcast on German television later
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
