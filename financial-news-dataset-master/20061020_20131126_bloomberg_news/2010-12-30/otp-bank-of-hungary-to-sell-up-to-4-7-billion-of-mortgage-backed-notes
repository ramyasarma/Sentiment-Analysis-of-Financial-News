OTP Bank Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest
lender, said its mortgage unit will issue as much as 1 trillion
forint ($4.7 billion) in mortgage-backed notes.  The notes may be denominated in forint, euros, Swiss francs
or U.S. dollars and may pay interest on a fixed, variable, or
indexed basis, the bank’s OTP Jelzalogbank Zrt. unit said in a
statement to the  Budapest Stock Exchange  yesterday. The notes
may have maturities of as many as 30 years.  “Mortgage issuance and the market of mortgage-backed notes
has a relatively short history in Hungary,” OTP said in its
listing of potential risks for investors. “There isn’t
information of sufficient quality and quantity which would allow
measuring market risks reliably.”  Hungary’s parliament passed a bill in October to aid
borrowers hurt by the forint’s depreciation against the Swiss
franc. The law banned banks from unilaterally changing loan
agreements to the “detriment” of borrowers or “arbitrarily”
increasing interest rates. The law also requires lenders to use
their own or the central bank’s mid-rate for currency
conversions on loan payments, according to the text of the law.  Foreign-currency loans amounted to 72 percent of Hungary’s
household credit at the end of June, of which 91 percent was in
currencies other than the euro, “mainly in Swiss francs,”
financial watchdog PSZAF said in a report last month.  The forint has slumped 19 percent against the franc this
year, the worst performance among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
