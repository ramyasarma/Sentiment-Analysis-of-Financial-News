Wheat futures fell the most in six
weeks on speculation that snow in the U.S. Great Plains will
improve soil moisture and provide protective cover over crops
before temperatures drop.  Areas of northwest  Kansas  may receive up to 6 inches (15
centimeters) of  snow  by tomorrow, while southwest to north-
central  Nebraska  may get up to 8 inches, according to National
Weather Service forecasts. Much of the area has had less than
half of the  normal  amount of precipitation in the past 60 days.
Temperatures may drop to minus 10 Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius),
according to World Weather Inc.  The storm “probably will provide some snow cover before
the cold weather comes across,” said Louise Gartner, the owner
of Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek,  Ohio .  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 19 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $7.8025 a bushel at 10:30 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. A close at that price would be the biggest decline
since Nov. 16.  Before today, prices jumped 48 percent this year as adverse
weather cut production in Russia and threatened crops in
Australia and the U.S.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
