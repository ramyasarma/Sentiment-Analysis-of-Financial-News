Daniel Sror, a lawyer for one of the
key witnesses in a rape case against former Israeli President
Moshe Katsav, said the court ruling, which decided his client
was telling the truth when she said she was raped, was “a
relief.”  He also said it was “a sad day” for the country when a
former president is convicted of such a crime. Sror spoke on
Army Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
