CVR Energy Inc.  reduced rates at its
 Coffeyville  refinery in Kansas after a fire and spill caused a
hydrogen sulfide release earlier this week, according to a
filing with state regulators.  Sulfur dioxide was also released as a result of the
incident at 4:10 a.m. Dec. 28, according to a filing with the
Kansas Emergency Management. “Charge was cut and operational
changes were made to end the release,” according to the filing.  Steve Eames , a spokesman for the refinery, didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone message and e-mail today.  A separate  filing  with the National Response Center said
the 120,000-barrel-a-day refinery reported a release from a
colbond flare.  The refinery processes crude oil from CVR’s owned and
leased gathering system and via pipeline from storage in
Cushing, Oklahoma, the company has said. CVR maintains capacity
on the Spearhead pipeline, which allows it to receive crude from
Canada.  The refinery more than doubled the amount of heavy, sour,
crude processed at the plant during the third quarter compared
with a year earlier, the company said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
