German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  called for a “significant strengthening” of the
integration of the euro region,  Der Tagesspiegel  reported,
citing a guest commentary by Schaeuble.  The more integrated European finance, budget, economic and
social policies are, the more independent the European Central
Bank would be, as it would be able to concentrate on monetary
stabilization, Schaeuble wrote in the newspaper.  As a result, the euro would be able to convince the
international financial community of its status as a long-term
stable currency, Schaeuble wrote, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
