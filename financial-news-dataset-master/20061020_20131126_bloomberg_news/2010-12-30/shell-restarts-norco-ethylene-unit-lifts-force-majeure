Royal Dutch Shell Plc  started an
ethylene unit at its Norco chemical plant in Louisiana after a
shutdown caused by a ruptured steam line, according to a company
spokeswoman.  The company is lifting a force majeure on ethylene
effective Jan. 1,  Alexandra Smith  said in an e-mail today. The
company does not have a date for lifting its force majeure on
propylene, she said.  Production at the plant was reduced Nov. 27 after the line
break, Smith said earlier this month.  The Norco plant is in St. Charles Parish, about 26 miles
(42 kilometers) west of New Orleans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
