Research In Motion Ltd. has offered
to install a network data analysis system at its center in India
as it approaches a Jan. 31 deadline to offer BlackBerry
monitoring set by India’s home ministry, the Economic Times
reported, citing an internal note from the ministry issued by
Deputy Director Arvind Kumar.  The system has the capability to automatically decode all
data flowing on RIM’s network and also ensures the intercepted
and decoded information does not travel outside the country, the
report said.  RIM earlier this month offered a “cloud-based” monitoring
method, which India rejected after learning that the intercepted
data would be routed via RIM’s servers in Europe, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
