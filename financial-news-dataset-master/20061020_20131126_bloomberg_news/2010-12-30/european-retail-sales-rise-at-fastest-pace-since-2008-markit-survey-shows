European retail sales increased at
the fastest pace in 2 1/2 years in December, signaling consumer
spending is gaining strength in the 16 nations using the euro.  A gauge of euro-area retail sales increased to 52.9 this
month from 51.3 in November, London-based Markit Economics said
in a  statement  on its website today. That is the highest since
May 2008, Markit said. The index is based on a survey of more
than 1,000 executives and a reading above 50 indicates
expansion.  The data “suggest that  consumer-spending growth  will
accelerate in the final quarter of 2010, with German consumers
leading the way,” Trevor Balchin, senior economist at Markit,
said in the statement. The October-December period was “the
best quarter in terms of monthly sales growth since the fourth
quarter of 2006.”  Germany is powering the region’s recovery, even as
governments across the region step up austerity measures, as
reviving global growth boosts orders at companies including
carmaker Daimler AG and encourages hiring. European confidence
in the  economic outlook  improved to the highest in three years
in November and could rise again this month, economists predict.  German retail sales increased for the third straight month
in December, Markit said in today’s report. “The rate of growth
eased slightly since November but remained sharp,” it said.
French sales gained for a second month, while Italy experienced
a decline.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
