Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is
planning “important” real estate sales in the first half of
2011 as values for its properties rise after the firm’s two
years in bankruptcy, Chief Executive Officer Bryan Marsal said.  “We have some strategic projects involving some very high-
quality assets that we hope to be bringing to an attractive
market,” Marsal said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
