Mortgage rates for U.S. loans
climbed to a seven-month high, increasing borrowing costs for
homebuyers in a sluggish real estate market.  The average rate for a 30-year  fixed loan  rose to 4.86
percent in the week ended today from 4.81 percent, Freddie Mac
said in a statement. The average 15-year  rate  advanced to 4.2
percent from 4.17 percent, the mortgage-finance company said.  Rising home loan rates may limit homebuyer demand as
housing remains a weak link for the economy. Home prices in
October fell 0.8 percent from a year earlier, the largest year-
over-year decline since December 2009, the S&P/Case-Shiller
 index  of property values showed this week.  “Optimism is fading from the housing market,”  Robert Shiller , an economics professor at Yale University and co-
creator of the index, said on Bloomberg Television on Dec. 28.  Sales of new and existing homes rose less than economists
estimated in November even as mortgage rates sank to the lowest
levels on record, reports from the Commerce Department and the
National Association of Realtors showed last week.  Pending home sales climbed more than forecast in November,
a sign demand is recovering following a post-tax credit plunge,
according to a report from the Realtors group today. The data
are based on contract signings, while existing-home sales
represent closings.  The rate for a 30-year loan has climbed for six of the past
seven weeks amid speculation that President Barack Obama’s
agreement to a two-year tax cut extension will boost economic
growth and inflation. The rise pushed the monthly cost of a
$300,000 loan to $1,585 from $1,462.  Borrowing costs are still near historic lows. The 30-year
fixed rate averaged about 4.7 percent in 2010, the lowest on an
annual basis since 1955,  Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac’s chief
economist, said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
