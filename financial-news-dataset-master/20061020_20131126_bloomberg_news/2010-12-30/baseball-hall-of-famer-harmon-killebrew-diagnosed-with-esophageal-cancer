Baseball Hall of Fame member  Harmon Killebrew  says he has been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and
is facing “perhaps the most difficult battle of my life.”  Killebrew, 74, whose 573 home runs are the 11th most in
Major League Baseball history, recently received the diagnosis,
according to a statement from the Cooperstown, New York-based
 National Baseball Hall of Fame .  Killebrew was inducted into the Hall in 1984 following a
22-year major-league career.  “With my wife, Nita, by my side, I have begun preparing
for what is perhaps the most difficult battle of my life,” he
said in the statement. “I am being treated by a team of medical
professionals at the Mayo Clinic. While my condition is very
serious, I have confidence in my doctors and the medical staff,
and I anticipate a full recovery.”  Killebrew, the 1969 American League Most Valuable Player,
played 21 seasons for the Washington Senators and Minnesota 
Twins franchise. He finished his career in 1975, playing the 
final season with the Kansas City Royals.  Killebrew played first base, third base and outfield. He
led the AL in home runs six times, and had a .256 career batting
average and 1,584 runs batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
