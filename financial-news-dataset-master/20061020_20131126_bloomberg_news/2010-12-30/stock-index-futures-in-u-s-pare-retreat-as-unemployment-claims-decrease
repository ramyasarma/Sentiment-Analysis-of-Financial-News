U.S. stock futures pared losses
after initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased more
than economists estimated.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in March fell
0.80 point to 1,265.90 at 8:31 a.m. New York time after slumping
2.10 points.  First-time filings for unemployment insurance decreased by
34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, compared with the
median forecast of 415,000 in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. There were no
special factors behind the drop, an official at the agency said
as the data were released.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
