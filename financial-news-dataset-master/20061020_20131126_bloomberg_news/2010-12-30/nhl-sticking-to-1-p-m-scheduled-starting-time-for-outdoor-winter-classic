The  National Hockey League  is
prepared for the Jan. 1 outdoor Winter Classic to start on
schedule even with rain and warm weather forecast in the host
city of Pittsburgh.  “We’re planning to go at 1 o’clock and we are fully
expecting to get the game in on Saturday,” NHL Chief Operating
Officer John Collins said today in a conference call with
reporters.  If the weather prevents the game from starting on time, it
can be moved to later in the day or to Jan. 2, Collins said. The
game between the  Pittsburgh Penguins , with league scoring leader  Sidney Crosby , and the Washington Capitals, with two-time Most
Valuable Player  Alex Ovechkin , is the fourth annual New Year’s
Day outdoor contest for the NHL. The previous three were the
most-watched regular-season NHL games since 1996, according to
the  Sports Business Journal .  “We’ll gather as much information as we possibly can to
make sure that we are taking into account the competitive
integrity of the game, the safety of the players and obviously
the convenience of the fans,” Collins said.  The weather in Pittsburgh on New Year’s Day is expected to
reach a high temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees
Celsius) with a 70 percent chance of rain showers in the
afternoon, according to  WXPI  television.  The Penguins (25-11-3) have the best record in the Eastern
Conference. The Capitals (22-12-5) are tied for second.  To contact the reporter on this story:
