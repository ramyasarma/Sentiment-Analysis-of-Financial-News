Mauritius’s  benchmark stocks measure 
rose to the highest since March 2008, led by New Mauritius
Hotels Ltd., on speculation of full occupation at the nation’s
top hotels. Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd. also gained.  The 37-member  SEMDEX  gauge added 0.8 percent to 1,951.67 at
the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the capital. The index has
increased 18 percent this year, matching the gain in the MSCI
Frontier Market Index.  New Mauritius Hotels , the biggest leisure
group by market value, rose the most in more than a month to 110
rupees while  Mauritius Commercial Bank , the largest lender and
biggest company on the market, surged to the highest since
August 2008.  “We have indications that all five-star hotels are fully
booked,” Roshan Ramoly, managing director of Port Louis-based
CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said by telephone today. “NMH operates
within this hotel segment, hence today’s interest for this
stock. The hotel operator’s 2009-2010 performance is a thing of
the past.”  The Indian Ocean island nation earns most of its foreign
currency from tourism and exports of sugar, clothing and
textiles. Mauritius is expected to attract 920,000 tourists this
year compared with 871,356 in 2009, the statistics agency said
in November. New Mauritius Hotels’ profit for the year through
September 2010 declined 44 percent to 659.78 million rupees ($22
million) compared with a year earlier, the company said Dec. 22.  The company expects earnings for the first quarter through
December to be around 10 percent more than last year’s and
“based on the present positive trend in bookings in the high
season, the second quarter is also likely to produce better
results than those realized last year,” it said.  Mauritius Commercial Bank trades on a  price multiple  of
11.45 times earnings, almost 10 percent lower than the 12.37
times earnings of  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. , the country’s
second-biggest lender by market value. Based on this discount,
“there has been a foreign pressure to accumulate this stock and
that pressure is ongoing”, Ramoly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
