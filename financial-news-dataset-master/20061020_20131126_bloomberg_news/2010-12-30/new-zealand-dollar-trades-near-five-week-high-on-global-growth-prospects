New Zealand’s dollar traded near a
five-week high against the greenback as U.S. economic reports
fueled speculation global growth will accelerate, encouraging
demand for currencies in nations with higher-yielding assets.  The Australian currency touched a level above parity with
the U.S. dollar for a seventh straight day, paring gains after
touching the highest level since the 1980s. Businesses in the
U.S. unexpectedly expanded in December at the fastest pace in 22
years, an index showed.  “There is growing optimism about the pace of the economic
recovery,” said  Toshihiko Sakai , trading head for currencies
and financial products in Tokyo at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd.’s Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp. “Excessive
liquidity is also finding its way into higher-yielding
currencies like Aussie and kiwi.”  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, was little
changed at 76.77 U.S. cents at 12:49 p.m. in New York, compared
with 76.86 cents yesterday. It earlier reached 77.27 cents, the
highest level since Nov. 23. It rose 0.1 percent to 62.80 yen,
from 62.73 yen.  The kiwi gained for the past five days versus its U.S.
counterpart, the longest winning streak since November. It was
poised for a 6.2 percent gain for the year.  Australia’s dollar weakened 0.6 percent to $1.0123, from
$1.0179 yesterday. It earlier touched $1.0198, the highest level
since the 1980s. The Aussie headed for a 13 percent gain this
year against its U.S. counterpart.  Aussie-Yen  The Australian currency declined 0.3 percent to 82.80 yen,
from 83.04 yen yesterday.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer rose to 68.6 this month, beating the most
optimistic forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
It was the highest level since July 1988. The median forecast in
the survey was for a decline to 61.  Initial U.S. jobless claims fell last week to the lowest
level since July 2008, 388,000, a sign the labor market is
improving heading into 2011. The number of contracts to buy
previously owned homes in the U.S. rose in November for the
fourth time in five months, National Association of Realtors
data showed.  The  MSCI World Index  slipped 0.3 percent to 1,275.78 after
reaching 1,283.68 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 22, 2008.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  To contact the reporters on this story:
