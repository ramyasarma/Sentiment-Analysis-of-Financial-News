U.S. Gulf crudes strengthened as the
discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent widened for
the fourth day in a row, making imports more expensive and
domestic grades more appealing.  The  gap  between WTI, the U.S. benchmark, and Brent, its
more expensive European counterpart, widened 21 cents to $3.23 a
barrel as of 11:26 a.m. Cargoes from Europe and West Africa are
purchased at a premium or discount to Brent.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 80 cents to $2.65 a barrel
at 12:04 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s  premium widened 40 cents to
$5.70 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 45 cents
to $4.65 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon ’s discount narrowed 25 cents to $1.
 West Texas Sour’s  differential strengthened 8 cents to $2.65 a
barrel.  Poseidon ’s discount to WTI narrowed 30 cents to 25
cents, and Mars Blend’s premium widened 40 cents to 65 cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  versus the WTI
benchmark was unchanged at $18.50 a barrel. The discount for
 Syncrude , a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the tar
sands in Alberta, was unchanged at $2.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
