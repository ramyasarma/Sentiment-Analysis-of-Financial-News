European  stocks dropped the most in
a month amid speculation this year’s rally has pushed valuations
on equities beyond the outlook for corporate and economic
growth.  Taylor Wimpey Plc and Barratt Developments Plc led declines
on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index as all 19 industry groups
retreated. Randgold Resources Ltd. fell 2.4 percent.  UniCredit
SpA , Italy’s biggest bank, lost 3.1 percent as yields on Italian
government bonds auctioned today rose.  The Stoxx 600 lost 1.3 percent to 277.02 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, the biggest drop since Nov. 29 and trimming its
gain for 2010 to 9.1 percent. Stocks have climbed this year as
surging corporate  profits  and actions by central banks to
support growth overcame concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis would derail the recovery. The advance has driven the
value of the Stoxx 600 to about 12 times the estimated profits
of its companies, the highest level in eight months, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s not surprising to see the market pull back given the
robust performance we’ve had for stocks this year,” said
 Richard Hunter , London-based head of U.K. equities at Hargreaves
Lansdown Plc. “Volumes are very thin and moves are getting
exagerated.”  The Stoxx 600 last week capped its longest stretch of
weekly gains since April and wiped out losses since the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and Weir Group Plc have posted the
biggest gains on the Stoxx 600 this year as profit topped
estimates. National Bank of Greece SA, Piraeus Bank SA and Bank
of Ireland were the worst performers after the European Union
led bailouts for the two nations.  Volumes Tumbled  Volumes in stocks traded have tumbled this week amid the
Christmas and New Year holidays. About 1.7 billion shares of
companies in the  Stoxx 600  changed hands today, compared with a
daily average of about 4.2 billion over the past year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European stocks slid today even after better-than-estimated
reports on U.S. unemployment and home sales. First-time filings
for unemployment insurance decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the
week ended Dec. 25, compared with the median forecast of
415,000, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
The National Association of Realtors index of pending home
resales increased 3.5 percent, topping the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey for a 0.8 percent rise.  China Growth  A report today showed China’s manufacturing growth slowed
for the first time in five months in December as the government
tightened monetary policy and chased energy-efficiency and
pollution targets. A purchasing managers’ index by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics fell to 54.4 from 55.3 in November. The
data are seasonally adjusted and a reading above 50 indicates an
expansion.  National benchmark indexes fell in all 18 western European
markets except Luxembourg. Germany’s DAX lost 1.2 percent, the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4 percent and France’s CAC 40 slid 1
percent.  Taylor Wimpey declined 1.1 percent to 31.28 pence. Barratt
Developments lost 1 percent to 89.95 pence.  Randgold, a producer of the metal in West Africa, slid 2.4
percent to 5,315 pence.  Cable & Wireless Communications led telecommunication
shares lower in Europe, dropping 3.7 percent to 48.61 pence, as
its shares fell below their 20- and 50-day moving average.  Italian Auction  UniCredit  lost 3.1 percent to 1.55 euros. Yields on Italian
government bonds and notes auctioned today rose compared with
previous sales as concern about levels of sovereign debt in
Europe continued to weigh on sentiment.  Italy sold 3 billion euros ($4 billion) of 2.25 percent
2013 bonds to yield 3.25 percent, compared with a yield of 2.86
percent in the last auction of comparable securities on Nov. 29.  Fiat SpA  rose 2.9 percent to 15.43 euros. The demerger of
Fiat Industrial will be effective as of Jan. 3, with every Fiat
shareholder owning one Fiat share and one Fiat Industrial share.  “We value Fiat SpA at 9.2 euros per share and Fiat
Industrial at 8.1 euros per shares,” Gruppo Banca Leonardo said
in a note today. “We reiterate our positive view as the
demerger should allow the two companies to follow different
paths with a greater freedom in making alliances to increase
scale.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
