Dongbu Insurance Co.  led South
Korean non-life insurers higher in Seoul trading after the
government announced measures to help stem losses at their auto
insurance businesses.  Dongbu Insurance jumped 6.8 percent to 45,000 won at the
close on the Korea Exchange, the highest since Jan. 21, 2008,
while the benchmark  Kospi  stock index added 0.4 percent. The 13-
member  Korea Insurance Index  added 2.3 percent.  The measures unveiled by the  Financial Services Commission 
yesterday include holding policyholders responsible for about 20
percent of the cost of damages from a car accident, subject to
certain ceilings in cases of large losses. The government will
also limit companies’ spending for sales activities.  “Regulators’ measures seem pretty much favorable to
companies, and shares are responding,” said  Lee Jin Woo , a fund
manager at KTB Asset Management in Seoul, which manages $9.6
billion in assets. “Auto insurance has been a headache for many
companies, and the measures show the government’s will to help
them.”  The government’s measures should help to improve auto loss
ratios, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by  Stan Lee  wrote
in a note dated yesterday.  LIG Insurance Co.  gained 3.4 percent to 23,050 won, while
 Hyundai Marine & Fire Insurance Co.  rose 7.2 percent to 26,150
won.  Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance Co.  added 4.4 percent to
225,000 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
