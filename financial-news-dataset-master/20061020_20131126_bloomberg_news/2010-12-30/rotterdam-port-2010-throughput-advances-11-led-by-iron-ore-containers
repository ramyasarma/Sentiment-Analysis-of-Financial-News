Rotterdam, Europe’s biggest port,
said full-year throughput has risen 11 percent in 2010, helped
by increasing world trade and economic growth in Germany.  Throughput in the Dutch port rose to 429,964 metric tons
this year from 386,957 metric tons in 2009, the government-owned
port said in an e-mailed statement today. The expansion was led
by an 81 percent advance in imports of iron ore and scrap and a
12 percent increase in total container traffic.  Rotterdam is the world’s third-largest port, after
Singapore and Shanghai, based on a 2008 ranking by the American
Association of Port Authorities. Europe’s next-biggest port is
Antwerp, which handles less than half the Dutch port’s volume.  “I’m cautiously optimistic about the throughput, which I
expect to grow by 2 to 3 percent to about 440 million tons” in
2011, Chief Executive Officer  Hans Smits  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
