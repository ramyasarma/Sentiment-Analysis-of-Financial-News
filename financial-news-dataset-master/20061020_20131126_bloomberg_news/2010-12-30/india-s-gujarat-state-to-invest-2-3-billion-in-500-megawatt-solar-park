India’s Gujarat state plans to
invest more than 105 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) to build
Asia’s first solar park providing infrastructure for 500
megawatts of plants that produce power from the sun.  Chief Minister  Narendra Modi  will inaugurate the park
today, according to an advertisement in the Economic Times.  The 2,000-hectare park at Charanka village will lease plots
on 30-year contracts to companies and provide water,
electricity, roads and power transmission services to the
projects, according to a  statement  on the Gujarat government’s
website.  “All the resources needed to produce electricity will be
provided to the producer on the site ensuring a saving of time
and money both for government and the energy-producers,” the
statement said.  The park, which expects to get 330 sunny days a year may
help create an additional 750 billion rupees of investment in
Gujarat by creating jobs in solar panel cleaning, assembling,
electrical wiring and other works, according to the statement.  The power produced at the site will be sold to the Gujarat
government, which has agreed to buy as much as 933 megawatts,
including new capacity, it said.  The Asian Development Bank may provide loans to the park,
Naoki Sakai, a senior climate change official from the bank,
said on Dec. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
