  Marc Faber , who advised investors to
buy U.S. stocks in March 2009 as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
began a rally of as much as 86 percent, said U.S. Treasuries are
a “suicidal” investment.  Government bonds are likely to decline, said Faber, who
publishes the Gloom, Boom and Doom report. After bottoming in
December 2008, the 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 3.9859
percent in April on government measures to stimulate the
economy. Concern about a second recession in three years sent
yields lower through October.  “This is a suicidal investment,” Faber said in a
telephone interview from St. Moritz,  Switzerland . “Over time,
interest rates on U.S. Treasuries will go up. Investors will
gradually understand that the Federal Reserve wants to have
negative real  interest rates . The worst investment is in U.S.
long-term bonds.”  On Nov. 3, the Fed said it would buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries through June, expanding record stimulus
and risking its credibility in a bid to reduce unemployment and
avert deflation. U.S. bond funds had withdrawals of $8.62
billion in the week ended Dec. 15, the most in more than two
years, according to Washington-based  Investment Company
Institute .  Rising Yields  Treasury 10-year note yields will rise to 5 percent from
yesterday’s level of 3.349 percent, Faber said, without
specifying a time frame. As bonds fall over the next decade, he
said investors should buy precious metals, real estate or
equities. U.S. debt has returned 5.7 percent in 2010, more than
erasing last year’s 3.7 percent loss, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index.  Treasuries fell today as reports showed initial jobless
claims dropped more than forecast, U.S. businesses expanded at
the fastest pace in two decades and pending home resales beat
expectations. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note advanced
0.02 percentage point to 3.37 percent at 4:28 p.m. in  New York ,
according to BGCantor Market Data.  Bonds may rally in the next two or three weeks, Faber said.  Faber correctly predicted in May 2005 that stocks would
make little headway that year. The S&P 500 gained 3 percent. He
was less prescient in March 2007, when he said the S&P 500 was
more likely to fall than rise because the threats of faster
inflation and slower growth persisted. The S&P 500 then climbed
10 percent to its record of 1,565.15 seven months later, and
ended the year up 3.5 percent.  Faber said equities may continue to advance as the dollar
weakens as a result of loose monetary policy.  “If you print money, the currency goes down and the S&P
500 goes up,” he said. “By the end of 2011, people will look
at 2012 and think 2012 could be a very bad year because the
policies applied are not sustainable and create a lot of
instability. Investors may look at 2012 and 2013 with horror.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
