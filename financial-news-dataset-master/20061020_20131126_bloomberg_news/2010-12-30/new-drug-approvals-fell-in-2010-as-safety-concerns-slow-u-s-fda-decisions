Twenty-one new drugs were approved
in the U.S. this year, the fewest since 2007, as the  Food and
Drug Administration  showed more willingness to delay or reject
medicines with potential safety risks.  The tally, compiled by Bloomberg from an FDA database,
compares with 25 approvals last year and 24 in 2008, according
to the FDA’s website. Nineteen new drugs were cleared in 2007,
the fewest in 24 years.  Today marks the last regular work day of 2010 for the U.S.
government. This year, the FDA also restricted the use of
London-based  GlaxoSmithKline Plc ’s diabetes pill Avandia and
withdrew from the market the weight-loss drug Meridia made by
Abbott Park, Illinois-based  Abbott Laboratories . The agency
citied heart complications in both actions.  “There’s a sense that the FDA is being more cautious,”
said Les Funtleyder, a fund manager at Miller Tabak & Co. in New
York, in a telephone interview. “If the rules get too onerous,
it could potentially keep innovative drugs out of U.S. hands.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
