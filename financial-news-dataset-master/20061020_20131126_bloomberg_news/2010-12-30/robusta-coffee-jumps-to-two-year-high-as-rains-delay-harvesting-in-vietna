Robusta coffee futures rose to a
two-year high on speculation that rains delayed the harvest and
curbed exports from Vietnam, the world’s largest grower of the
beans.  Vietnam’s 2010-11 coffee crop may be down 15 percent, Thoi
Bao Kinh Te Vietnam newspaper reported on Dec. 28, citing
information from the ministry of agriculture and rural
development. Vietnam’s crop usually starts by November.  “Prices are up as exports out of Vietnam for December are
expected to be lower than the previous year, and some see this
as a sign that production will not meet expectations,” said
 Keith Flury , an analyst at Rabobank International in London, in
an e-mail today. “A late rainy season delayed this year’s
harvest.”  Robusta-coffee futures for March delivery rose as much as
$128, or 6.3 percent, to $2,152 a metric ton, the highest price
for a most-active contract since September 2008. It was up $63
at $2,087 a ton by 12:08 p.m. in London, bringing the gain this
year to 61 percent.  Arabica coffee for March delivery gained 1.7 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.4130 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $2.4175, the highest for a most-
active contract since Dec. 22.  White sugar for March delivery fell $3, or 0.4 percent,
to $823.40 a ton on NYSE Liffe and raw sugar for March delivery
