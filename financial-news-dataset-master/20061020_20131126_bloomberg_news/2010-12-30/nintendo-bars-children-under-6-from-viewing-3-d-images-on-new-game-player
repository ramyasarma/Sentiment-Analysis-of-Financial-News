Nintendo Co.  will bar children ages
6 and younger from using the 3-D functions of its new handheld
game machine at an introductory event for the device.  “Looking at 3-D images for a long time may harm the growth
of children’s eyes,” Nintendo  said  in a note to visitors coming
to the event next month, posted on its website. The company’s
new 3DS players will be promoted at the three-day event in Chiba
prefecture, near Tokyo.  The handheld, which can show 3-D images without using
special glasses, is Nintendo’s biggest portable product debut
since the 2004 release of the touch-screen DS player, which sold
more than 132 million units worldwide. The world’s largest maker
of video-game players will start selling the product in Japan
from Feb. 26 and in the U.S. and Europe the following month.  Nintendo, based in Kyoto, also said users should take a
break every 30 minutes when playing games in 3-D format or stop
playing immediately if they feel ill.  The company faces intensifying competition from Sony Corp.
and Microsoft Corp., which have introduced motion-sensing
controllers for their video-game consoles, while Apple Inc.’s
iPhone and iPad devices are increasingly being used for gaming.  Nintendo fell 1.5 percent to 24,050 yen as of 10:30 a.m. in
Osaka trading, narrowing its  gain  this year to 9.1 percent.
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
