U.K. stocks declined for a second
day, trimming this year’s rally for the FTSE 100 Index, as
trading volumes tumbled before the New Year holiday.  Fresnillo Plc , the Mexico City-based miner of gold and
silver, gained 2.6. ProStrakan Group Plc jumped 18 percent after
the specialty pharmaceutical company won U.S. approval for a
testosterone gel. Aggreko Plc and Prudential Plc dropped.  Cable
& Wireless Communications Plc  fell as telecommunications shares
retreated.  The benchmark  FTSE 100  declined 25.35, or 0.4 percent, to
5,971.01 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. Even so, the gauge is
headed for a 2010 advance of 10 percent. About 417 million
shares of companies in the FTSE 100 changed hands, compared with
the daily average volume for this year of 1.6 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  FTSE All-Share Index  fell 0.4
percent, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  lost 0.3 percent.  The FTSE 100 last week ended above 6,000 for the first time
since June 2008, helped this year by better-than-expected
corporate profits and a bond-purchase plan by the U.S. Federal
Reserve to stimulate economic growth. The British benchmark is
still 11 percent below its June 2007 high, before the financial
crisis triggered a sell-off in equity markets worldwide.  Jobless Claims  Stocks in Europe slid today even as a U.S. report showed
that initial jobless claims fell last week to the lowest level
since July 2008, a sign that the labor market is improving
heading into 2011. Separate reports showed that businesses in
the U.S. grew in December at a faster pace than forecast and the
number of contracts to buy previously owned homes rose more than
forecast last month.  Earlier today, yields on Italian government bonds and notes
auctioned today rose compared with previous sales as concern
about levels of sovereign debt in Europe continued to weigh on
sentiment. Italy sold 3 billion euros ($4 billion) of 2.25
percent 2013 bonds to yield 3.25 percent, compared with a yield
of 2.86 percent in the last auction of comparable securities on
Nov. 29.  Fresnillo , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
increased 2.6 percent to 1,661 pence. Gold rose to a three-week
high and silver touched a 30-year high today, before retreating.  ProStrakan jumped 18 percent to 105 pence, the biggest
advance since Nov. 9. The Galashiels, Scotland-based company
said today it won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for
the Fortesta testosterone gel.  Aggreko, the world’s largest provider of mobile power-
supplies, slid 2 percent to 1,496 pence. Prudential, Britain’s
largest insurer, lost 1.9 percent to 668 pence.  Cable & Wireless Communications sank 3.7 percent to 48.61
pence, as its shares fell below their 20- and 50-day moving
average.  Vodafone Group Plc , the world’s largest mobile-phone
company, retreated 1.1 percent to 167 pence.  ARM Holdings Plc, the designer of chips that power Apple
Inc.’s iPhone, fell 0.8 percent to 430.1 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
