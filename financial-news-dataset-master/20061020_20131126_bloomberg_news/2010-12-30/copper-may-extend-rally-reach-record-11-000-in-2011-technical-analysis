Copper, which has surged 27 percent
this year, may extend a rally to reach a record $11,000 a metric
ton in the first half of next year, according to a technical
analyst with Samsung Securities Co.  The metal is likely to remain on an uptrend in a pattern of
higher peaks and higher valleys, and may touch $11,000, based on
Fibonacci projections, said Seoul-based You Seung Min at the
brokerage unit of South Korea’s largest family run conglomerate.
Prices steadied above the 50-day moving average and copper’s
weekly moving average converge/diverge, or MACD, remained above
the signal line since August, showing the ascending trend is
“stable,” he said.  “Copper’s uptrend grew stronger since summer and the rally
doesn’t look overdone,” said You, who correctly forecast in
August that the metal would rise to more than the closing high
of $7,990 in the second half. “The trend looks very stable and
will continue through next year.”  Copper for three-month delivery surged to an all-time high
$9,447 yesterday and is poised for a second annual gain as
demand from emerging markets reduced inventories. The contract
traded little changed at $9,394.75 a ton by 10:04 a.m. in
Singapore. Copper use will outpace supply by 825,000 tons next
year, according to Barclays Capital. The metal may rise to
$10,475 next year, according to traders and investors surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages
after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
