Spain has between 700,000 and 1.1
million unsold homes, an amount that will drag on a recovery in
the housing market as prices will probably keep falling in 2011,
the  Bank of Spain  said.  “We will see a process of gradual absorption of
accumulated excess supply, which will be slow and mean that
housing investment will not contribute to the growth of activity
in the near future,” the banking regulator said in its monthly
economic bulletin published today.  While new-home construction soared during Spain’s property
boom to 750,000 units in 2007, it dropped to 137,000 in the 12
months through September, a figure that probably won’t increase
much anytime soon, the Bank of Spain said.  Home prices will likely keep falling because of tax
changes, the regulator said. A tax incentive for house purchases
expires at the end of this year.  “Some fiscal factors have been able to cushion the price
adjustment in 2010, but in 2011 it looks probable that prices
will keep moderating,” the Bank of Spain said.  Prices for Spanish homes have dropped by about 13 percent
from the market’s peak in the first quarter of 2008, according
to government statistics. A survey by property website
Fotocasa.es and IESE business school says the decline has been
more than 22 percent, while R.R. de Acuna & Asociados, a Madrid-
based property adviser, predicts prices may drop another 20
percent in the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
