WPP Plc , the world’s largest
advertising company, agreed to buy Blue State Digital LLC, the
agency that developed the “Obama for America” online campaign
in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.  Blue State Digital specializes in advocacy, membership and
fundraising campaigns, WPP said in an e-mailed statement today.
The agency’s sales have grown more than 30 percent a year since
it was founded in 2004. Blue State Digital employs 130 people in
its offices in Washington, Boston, New York, Los Angeles and
London. No purchase price was given.  “Their work on the 2008 ‘Obama for America’ campaign is
demonstrative of their market-leading approach to technology and
online communications,” WPP said today. The London-based
company will buy closely held Blue State Digital through WPP
Digital, its digital investment and operating arm. The deal is
WPP’s fifth acquisition this month.  In the 2008 election,  Barack Obama  harvested more campaign
cash than anyone before him, using both the Internet and
traditional high-roller dinners to bring in more than $650
million from some 3 million donors for his presidential
campaign. The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee,  John Kerry ,
raised less than half that amount, as did  George W. Bush  and  Al Gore  combined in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
