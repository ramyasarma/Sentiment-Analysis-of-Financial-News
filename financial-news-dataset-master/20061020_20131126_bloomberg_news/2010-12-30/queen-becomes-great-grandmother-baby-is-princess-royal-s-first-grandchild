Queen Elizabeth II  became a great-
grandmother for the first time when Autumn Phillips, the wife of
her grandson, Peter Phillips, gave birth to a girl.  The baby, born yesterday at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital
in Gloucester, western England, weighed 8 pounds 8 ounces (3.9
kilograms), Buckingham Palace said in a  statement on its
website . It’s also the first grandchild for the queen’s
daughter,  Princess Anne , known as the Princess Royal. The girl
is 12th in line to the British throne.  “The queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal,
Captain Mark Phillips and Autumn’s family have been informed and
are delighted with the news,” the palace said. “The baby’s
name will be confirmed in due course.”  The royal family announced last month that  Prince William ,
second in line to the throne, will marry Kate Middleton , ending
years of speculation about an engagement. The wedding will take
place at Westminster Abbey in London on April 29 and the day
will be marked by a public holiday. Peter Phillips’s sister Zara
announced her engagement to Mike Tindall, a rugby player,
earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
