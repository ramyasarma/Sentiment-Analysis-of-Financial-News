Rubber extended gains to post a
second straight annual advance on concern that a shortage may
worsen early next year as top exporter Thailand enters a low-
production period known as wintering.  The June-delivery contract added as much as 0.9 percent to
414.8 yen per kilogram ($5,094 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange and closed at 414.5 yen, bringing this year’s
gain to 50 percent. The bourse will be closed from tomorrow and
resume trading on Jan. 4.  Latex production in Thailand is set to shrink as growers
reduce tapping of rubber trees from February to April. The
seasonal drop in output may worsen a supply shortage as global
demand rises, led by car sales in China and India. Rubber
climbed to a record 419.3 yen on Dec. 27.  “Concern over tight supply continued lending support to
the market,” said  Takaki Shigemoto , an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo. A rebound in oil prices also pushed
rubber higher, reversing its early 1.8 percent decline,
Shigemoto said.  Crude oil for February delivery rose as much as 0.2 percent
to $91.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
losing 0.4 percent yesterday. The contract touched $91.88 on
Dec. 27, the highest level since Oct. 7, 2008.  Rubber futures declined earlier as China, the world’s
biggest consumer, may take measures to curb speculation, said
 Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst at commodity broker Central
Shoji Co.  Supply Drop  China may increase the size of agricultural futures
contracts in 2012 to curb speculation, the Shanghai Securities
News reported today, citing no one. Contracts already being
traded will expire by the end of 2011 and the new contracts are
still being studied, the report said. Raising the sizes will
increase the amount of capital required for trading and keep
some speculators out of futures markets, it said.  Supply of natural rubber from nine producers representing
92 percent of global output is expected to fall 6.3 percent in
the fourth quarter, cutting this year’s production growth to 5.7
percent, from 6.6 percent forecast in November, the  Association
of Natural Rubber Producing Countries  said in its monthly
bulletin.  Output from the association’s members is estimated at 9.42
million tons this year and may climb to 9.92 million next year,
the group said.  May-delivery rubber in Shanghai advanced 0.8 percent to
close at 36,545 yuan ($5,534) a ton. The price has retreated
from a record 38,920 yuan on Nov. 11 amid concern that China may
take steps to cool inflation and economic expansion.  The cash rubber  price  in Thailand was unchanged at a record
149.55 baht ($4.96) per kilogram today as persistent rains in
the country’s southern provinces limit supplies, according to
the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
