Minnesota Vikings quarterback  Brett Favre  failed another concussion test yesterday, four days before
what likely will be the final game of his National Football
League career, the Detroit News reported.  Favre, 41, will have another test and the team hopes he can
play against the Detroit Lions on Jan. 2, the  newspaper said ,
citing Vikings interim coach  Leslie Frazier ’s comments on a
conference call with the Detroit media.  An e-mail seeking confirmation from  Bob Hagan , a spokesman
for the Vikings, wasn’t immediately returned.  Favre, who suffered the concussion Dec. 20 in a loss to the
Chicago Bears, missed the Vikings’ win over Philadelphia two
days ago and won’t be cleared to play in the season finale until
he passes the test.  Frazier said the decision on Favre’s game status would have
to be made no later than Jan. 1, the day before Minnesota (6-9)
concludes its season at Detroit (5-10).  Rookie  Joe Webb , who led the Vikings to a 24-14 win over
the Eagles in his debut as a starter two days ago, would get the
start if Favre is unavailable.  Favre, the three-time NFL Most Valuable Player, has said he
won’t return for another season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
