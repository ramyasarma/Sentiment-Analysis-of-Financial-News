South Korean contractors may win
more than $70 billion worth of overseas orders next year as
higher oil prices and economic growth boosts demand for more
refineries and infrastructure projects. South Korean builders
received a record $71.6 billion in contracts abroad this year,
46 percent more than in 2009, the Ministry of Land, Transport
and Maritime Affairs said today in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
