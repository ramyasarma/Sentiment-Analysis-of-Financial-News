The first developer to start
building on the world-map-shaped chain of islands off Dubai’s
coast canceled plans to hold a New Year’s Eve party there after
failing to build the beach bar where it would have been held.  The event on the “Monte Carlo” island has been rescheduled
for next year because of “circumstances beyond our control,”
 Josef Kleindienst , chief executive officer of family-owned
Kleindienst Group, said in a statement today.  The Austrian developer was the first to begin construction
on “The World” project since developer Nakheel PJSC put work
on hold in 2008. Kleindienst Group bought six islands for a 3.1
billion-dirham ($840 million) project known as The Heart of
Europe that will include vacation homes, hotels and a replica of
a European city center with air-conditioned streets. The beach
bar on Monte Carlo was due to be the first property completed.  Work has been slowed by technical obstacles and higher-than-
expected costs,  The National  reported on Nov. 21, citing the
CEO. Kleindienst said compaction of the soil is causing the
islands to spread out and studies are being carried out on how
to prevent that, the newspaper said.  The CEO said he was “disappointed” about the delay,
though he takes a “pragmatic” view of the situation.  “Kleindienst Group is playing a part in writing the
history of one of Dubai’s most ambitious projects, and we remain
committed to our development and our position as pioneers out on
The World islands,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
