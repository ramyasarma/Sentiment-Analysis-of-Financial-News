The Polish government will probably
decide today to reduce contributions to private funds to 5.3
percent or 2 percent of salaries, from the current 7.3 percent,
 Gazeta Wyborcza  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The remainder would be either kept in personal accounts at
the state social-insurance fund or transferred in the form of
non-tradable bonds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
