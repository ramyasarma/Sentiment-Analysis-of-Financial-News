Crude oil fell, heading for its
first close below $91 a barrel in five days, before a U.S.
government report that may show demand growth hasn’t been
sufficient to reduce fuel stockpiles.  Oil declined in New York from near its highest price in 26
months after the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute
said crude oil supplies rose 0.9 percent to 345.1 million
barrels. The Energy Department will release its Weekly Petroleum
Status Report at 11 a.m. in Washington.  “The API has been relatively accurate in recent weeks” in
predicting the Energy Department’s report, said  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at Credit Agricole CIB. “I
was surprised by the API numbers showing that distillates rose,
as it suggests that the weather hasn’t affected demand.”  Crude for February delivery fell as much as 70 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $90.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and traded at $90.44 at 1:51 p.m. London time. The
contract rose to $91.88 on Dec. 27, the highest price since Oct.
7, 2008. Brent crude for February settlement was down 43 cents
at $93.71 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  A Bloomberg News survey showed U.S. oil inventories
 probably fell  for a fourth week, extending the longest decline
in a year. The API said yesterday crude oil supplies rose 0.9
percent to 345.1 million barrels. Oil-supply totals from the API
and DOE have moved in the same direction 75 percent of the time
over the past four years.  Third-Worst Performer  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  U.S. oil supplies may have declined 2.85 million barrels in
the week ended Dec. 24, based on the median estimate from 14
analysts polled by Bloomberg News.  Stockpiles  decreased in the
previous three weeks to 340.7 million, 6.8 percent above the
five-year average, according to the Energy Department.  Crude futures have gained 14 percent this year as investors
bet the economy is recovering. Oil, which rallied 78 percent in
2009, is the third-worst performer this year among 22
commodities tracked by Bloomberg, as rising supplies countered
optimism fuel consumption is recovering. Natural gas and cocoa
are the worst performers.  Gasoline Supplies  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has risen 13 percent this
year, closing above 1,251.70 last week for the first time since
Sept. 12, 2008, the last trading day before Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. filed the world’s biggest bankruptcy, prompting a
46 percent drop for the gauge through March 2009. Bonds, as
measured by Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market
Plus Index, have returned 4.6 percent.  Gasoline stockpiles  probably rose  1.5 million barrels from
217.2 million, the Bloomberg News survey showed. Distillate fuel
inventories, including heating oil and diesel, are expected to
have slipped 625,000 barrels from 160.7 million.  “It’s possible for the market to rise from the beginning
of next year, but for now, crude oil will be steady, slightly
above $90,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a Tokyo-based commodity
derivatives sales manager at Newedge, a brokerage. “There’s a
lot of inventory, therefore it’s not easy to go higher.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
