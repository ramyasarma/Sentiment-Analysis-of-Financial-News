U.S. public pension funds’ holdings
rose 6.2 percent in the third quarter, reaching the highest
level in two years as the stock market recovered, the U.S.
Census Bureau reported.  Holdings rose to $2.5 trillion from $2.35 trillion at the
end of the second quarter, according to  the report  on the  100
largest state and local government pension  funds. The increase
follows a 5.3 percent decline in the second quarter.  Stock holdings , which make up about one-third of the funds’
investments, rose 9.8 percent in the quarter, the report said.
The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  climbed 10.4 percent in the
third quarter after declining 11.9 percent in the second.
Corporate bonds climbed 3.2 percent last quarter, international
securities gained 13.9 percent and federal government securities
declined by 1.1 percent.  Illinois, Oklahoma and Kentucky had the most underfunded
state pension systems in the U.S. in their 2009 fiscal years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
