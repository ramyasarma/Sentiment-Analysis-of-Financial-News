North Korea bolstered the size of
its special forces, deployed new battle tanks and increased its
focus on unconventional warfare, according to a white paper from
the South Korean Defense Ministry.  The number of lightly equipped special forces, trained to
quickly infiltrate South Korea, increased by 20,000 to 200,000
over the past two years, the biennial defense paper released in
Seoul showed.  South Korea yesterday named the North Korean regime as its
“enemy” and promised to combine a stronger military deterrent
with a renewed push to prepare its neighbor’s 23 million people
for reunification.  North Korea is increasingly focused on weapons such as
improvised explosives and low-cost missiles and its conventional
artillery and rockets remain capable of a massive surprise
attack on Seoul, the paper said.  The Storm Tiger battle tank, believed to be based on the
former Soviet Union’s T-72s, may be equipped with 125 millimeter
or 115 millimeter main guns, the paper said, without revealing
how many Storm Tigers were operational. The total number of
North Korean tanks increased to 4,100 in November this year from
3,900 in 2008.  The number of soldiers in North Korea’s military was
unchanged at about 1.19 million, the report said. That compares
with about 650,000 active military personnel in South Korea and
28,500 service personnel stationed in the nation by the U.S.  South Korea’s President  Lee Myung Bak  has found revived
public support for the tougher approach to  Kim Jong Il ’s regime
in Pyongyang he promised to pursue when elected in 2008, after
two attacks this year raised tension on the peninsula to its
highest in decades. North Korea shelled a South Korean island
last month, killing four people, and was blamed for sinking the
Cheonan warship in March, in which 46 sailors died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
