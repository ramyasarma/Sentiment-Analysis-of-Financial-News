Mid-sized U.K. companies found
finance easier to get this year as the demand outlook for their
goods and services improved, the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills said.  Ninety-three percent of mid-sized companies that sought
funds in 2010 were able to obtain what they required, the
ministry said in a  statement on its website  today, citing an
annual survey. That compared with 82 percent in a 2009 study.  Next year, 58 percent of respondents said they expect sales
to be higher than current levels, compared with 54 percent
reporting an increase in 2010, the report found. The net balance
of companies reporting sales gains rose to 31 percentage points
this year from minus 25 points in 2009, indicating a greater
number of businesses are growing, BIS said.  A mid-sized business is defined in the report as having
annual sales of between 25 million pounds ($39 million) and 500
million pounds. The study was carried out for the ministry by
research organization  BDRC Continental , which surveyed 401
companies from Sept. 22 to Oct. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
