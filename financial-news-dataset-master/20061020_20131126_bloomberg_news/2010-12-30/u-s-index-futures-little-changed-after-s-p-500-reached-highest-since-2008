U.S. stocks declined as the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index’s highest valuation since June overshadowed
reports showing a drop in jobless claims, the fastest business
expansion in two decades and a gain in pending home sales.  American Express Co., DuPont Co. and Pfizer Inc. had the
biggest declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as it fell
from two-year highs.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp . rallied 6.9
percent after the Daily Mail reported that BHP Billiton Ltd. may
make a $90-a-share bid for the oil and natural gas producer.
D.R. Horton Inc. led gains in homebuilders after pending sales
rose more than expected.  The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent, also from a two-year high, to
1,257.88 at 4 p.m. in New York. The index has risen 13 percent
this year and 6.6 percent this month, the most for December
since 1991. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 15.67 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 11,569.71 today.  “We’ve had a heck of a month for stocks,” said Walter Todd, who helps manage about $900 million at Greenwood Capital
Associates in Greenwood, South Carolina. “It’s no surprise to
see investors taking a bit of a pause after a big run-up.
However, the positive catalysts are still in place and that
bodes well for a very decent 2011. Today’s jobless claims
figures were a real big positive.”  Rally Since July  The S&P 500 advanced 23 percent from its July low through
yesterday as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings
and as the Federal Reserve pledged to buy up to $600 billion in
Treasuries to stimulate the economy. Its rally to a two-year
high pushed its valuation to 15.7 times reported profits, the
highest since June.  The index’s 86 percent increase from a 12-year low on March
9, 2009, is the biggest for a comparable time period since 1955,
according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P.  U.S. equity futures pared declines after the Labor
Department said first-time filings for unemployment insurance
decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Dec. 25,
compared with the median forecast of 415,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey. There were no special factors behind the drop, an
official at the agency said as the data were released.  Separately, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc.’s gauge of business conditions expanded in December at the
fastest pace in two decades. The group’s business barometer rose
to 68.6, exceeding the most optimistic forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News and the highest level since July
1988. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Chinese Manufacturing  Emerging-markets stocks rallied today after a report showed
that China’s manufacturing is growing, signaling more demand for
industrial metals. An index of China’s manufacturing was 54.4
this month, compared with 55.3 in November, according to the
purchasing managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. A figure over 50 signals expansion.  Copper climbed to a record in London and New York, and
nickel and zinc gained.  “Growth in the rest of the world -- not so much Europe --
has been very good for U.S. companies,” said Albert Meyer,
president of Bastiat Capital LLC in Plano, Texas, which manages
about $28 million. “The recent run-up perhaps anticipated some
really good news.”  American Express, the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, fell 0.8 percent to $42.51. DuPont, the third-biggest
U.S. chemical maker, dropped 0.7 percent to $49.69. Pfizer, the
world’s biggest drugmaker, declined 0.6 percent to $17.49.  Anadarko Rises  Anadarko Petroleum rallied 6.9 percent to $75.59. BHP
Billiton may make a $90-a-share bid for the U.S. oil and
natural-gas producer, the Daily Mail reported, without saying
where it got the information. Ruban Yogarajah, a London-based
spokesman for BHP, declined to comment on the Daily Mail report
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  D.R. Horton, the biggest U.S. home builder by market value,
rose 0.8 percent to $12.01. An index of pending home resales
compiled by the National Association of retailers rose 3.5
percent in November after a record 10 percent increase in
October, a sign sales are recovering following a post-tax credit
plunge. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called
for a 0.8 percent increase in November.    MBIA Inc . gained the most in more than two months, rallying
15 percent to $11.87 after a court development raised prospects
it may resume guaranteeing city and state debt.  Stocks in developed nations took 17 months longer than
emerging markets to erase losses spurred by  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc .’s 2008 bankruptcy, recovering after the Federal
Reserve took steps to stimulate growth.    MSCI World   The MSCI World Index of 1,660 companies in 24 developed
countries such as the U.S., U.K. and Japan rose as high as
1,283.68 yesterday. The gauge surpassed its closing level of
1,283.14 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last session before Lehman’s
collapse caused a 46 percent drop through March 2009.  The “new economic leadership is reflected by emerging
market stocks, which recovered to pre-Lehman levels much faster
than have developed stock markets,” said James Paulsen, chief
investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management, which oversees about $340 billion. “Economic
activity in these regions did not slow or contract as deeply and
have recovered much faster.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
