company set up to buy loans from lenders, will sign debt-

Access, which passed the central bank’s audit last year, has
applied to have its non-performing loans taken over by Amcon,
BusinessDay reported yesterday.  Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd.  (MCB MP), the largest lender
and biggest company by market value, rallied 2 rupees, or 1.2
percent, to 164 rupees, the highest since August 2008. The
lender trades on a price multiple of 11.45 times earnings,
almost 10 percent lower than the 12.37 times earnings of State
Bank of Mauritius Ltd., the country’s second-biggest bank by
market value. Based on this discount, “there has been a foreign
pressure to accumulate this stock and that pressure is
ongoing,” Roshan Ramoly, managing director of Port Louis-based
CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said by telephone today.  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd.  (NMH MP), the country’s biggest
leisure group by market value, rose the most since Nov. 25,
adding 2 rupees, or 1.9 percent, to 110 rupees.  “We have indications that all five-star hotels are fully
booked,” Ramoly said. “NMH operates within this hotel segment,
hence today’s interest for this stock.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
