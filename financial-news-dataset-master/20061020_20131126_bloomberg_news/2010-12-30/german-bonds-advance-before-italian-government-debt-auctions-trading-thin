German government bonds advanced as
investors reduced positions on the last trading day of the year
and as Italy’s borrowing costs rose at a government debt sale.  The gains extended bunds’ best annual returns since 2008 as
the debt crisis that ravaged the euro region through 2010
boosted demand for the safest assets. Italy sold 6 billion euros
($8 billion) of bonds maturing in 2013 and 2021, as well as
2.1 billion euros of floating-rate notes due 2015 and 2017. The
average yields on all four securities were higher compared with
previous sales.  “The eye-catching aspect of the results is the spike in
yields,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income analyst at WestLB
AG in Dusseldorf, Germany. “In the medium-term context, this
raises some concerns given that funding costs are still on the
way up. There’s thin liquidity today, and so the auctions are a
modest success for the Italian Treasury. There might be some
relief here and traders are ready to close their books.”  The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
government security, fell six basis points to 2.96 percent as of
12:32 p.m. in London. The 2.5 percent security due January 2021
rose 0.46, or 4.6 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,326) face amount, to
95.06. Two-year note yields slipped two basis points to
0.87 percent.  Bunds stayed higher after the Italian auction results.  Italy sold 3 billion euros of 2.25 percent 2013 bonds at a
yield of 3.25 percent, compared with a 2.86 percent yield at the
last auction of comparable securities on Nov. 29. The Italian
Treasury sold 3 billion euros of 3.75 percent 2021 bonds to
yield 4.80 percent, up from a yield of 4.43 percent on Nov. 29.  Italian Sales  Italy sold 836 million euros of floating-rate securities
due 2015 to yield 2.80 percent, compared with a yield of 1.78
percent in the previous auction on Sept. 29. Italy also sold
1.296 billion euros of floating-rate notes due 2017 to yield
2.92 percent, compared with 2.30 percent on Nov. 29.  Italian  business confidence  rose for a third month to the
highest in almost three years as executives shared consumers’
optimism about the  economic recovery .  The  Isae  institute’s manufacturing-sentiment index climbed
to 103, the highest since February 2008, from a revised 101.7 in
November, the research center said in a statement from Rome
today. Economists had predicted a reading of 102, according to
the  median  of 15 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  A separate report showed Italian producer prices rose
0.4 percent in November, up 4.1 percent from a year earlier.
That compares with a 0.2 percent decline in October.  Cost-Cutting  Italian 10-year yields were little changed at 4.83 percent.
Spanish 10-year bonds rose, with the yield three basis points
lower at 5.49 percent. Irish 10-year yields were three basis
points lower at 9.3 percent and equivalent Greek yields were one
basis point lower at 12.62 percent.  Spain’s Treasury expects to sell a net 47.2 billion euros
of debt next year, 24 percent less than in 2010, the Economy
Ministry said yesterday.  Cost-cutting by the Spanish government meant it sold
62.1 billion euros in 2010, 19 percent less than it originally
planned, the ministry said in a statement sent by e-mail.  Bunds have handed investors a 6 percent return this year,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Treasuries gained
5.7 percent, the indexes show. Italian securities have slipped
0.8 percent and Spanish debt has lost 4.4 percent, while Greek
bonds have tumbled 20 percent. Irish debt has lost 14 percent in
the period, while Portuguese securities declined 8.1 percent,
according to the EFFAS indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
