  Hong Kong  stocks rose, reversing a
drop, as commodity producers gained with metal prices, and
carmakers climbed on optimism demand growth can outweigh the end
of tax breaks, countering slowing manufacturing growth in China.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
increased 2.5 percent.  Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd .,
the Chinese partner of Japan’s Nissan Motor Co., surged 7.2
percent. Sany Heavy Equipment International Holdings Co., a
maker of coal mining equipment, slid 2.7 percent.  China’s manufacturing is “still expanding but the fact
that it has slowed may worry some,” said Andrew Sullivan,
director of institutional sales at OSK Securities Hong Kong Ltd.
“Also the expectation of more interest-rate rises in early 2011
could result in more slowing ahead.”  The  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.1 percent to close at 22,999.34,
after dropping as much as 0.3 percent. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
rose 0.6 percent to 12,586.84.  To contact the reporter on this story:
