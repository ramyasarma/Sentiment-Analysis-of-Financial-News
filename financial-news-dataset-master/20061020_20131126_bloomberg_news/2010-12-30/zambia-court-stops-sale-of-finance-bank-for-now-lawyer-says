Zambia’s high court stopped the
central bank from selling  Finance Bank Zambia Ltd. , said John
Sangwa, the lawyer representing some shareholders in the
privately owned lender seized by the Bank of Zambia on Dec. 10.  The court issued an order halting any possible sale until a
full hearing, Sangwa said by phone today from Lusaka, the
capital. It will hear arguments from the central bank and
Finance Bank on Jan. 4, he said.  “I have a court injunction in my hands right now stating
that the Bank of Zambia cannot dispose of my clients shares in
Finance Bank Zambia Ltd.,” Sangwa said.  The central bank appointed  FirstRand Ltd.  of South Africa
to manage Finance Bank, Zambia’s biggest privately owned lender
that is partly owned by  Credit Suisse Group AG , after accusing
it of breaching financial laws. The lender may be sold after
three months under central bank supervision, according to Lameck
Zimba, head of supervision at Bank of Zambia.  The bank remains under supervision and the central bank
will “determine its destiny,” Bank of Zambia spokesman Kanguya
Mayondi said by phone from Lusaka.  “As far as I am concerned the status quo at Finance Bank
Zambia Ltd. remains the same,” he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
