Canadian stocks fell for the first
time in three days as gold declined after U.S. reports showed
initial jobless claims dropped to the lowest level since July
2008 and pending home sales increased.    Goldcorp Inc ., the world’s second-biggest gold producer by
market value, lost 0.6 percent as the metal retreated for the
first time in four days.  Teck Resources Ltd ., Canada’s largest
base-metals and coal producer, advanced 1.8 percent as copper
rallied to a record.  Cenovus Energy Inc ., the country’s fifth-
biggest energy company, decreased 0.8 percent as U.S. crude
inventories fell less than most analysts forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 14.76
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,434.41.  “As the economy starts to pick up and we get businesses to
start using the money that they have on their balance sheets and
we get a bit of pick up in confidence, that will be a bit of a
drag on the gold price,” said Jennifer Radman, who helps
oversee about C$1 billion ($1 billion) as a money manager at
Caldwell Investment Management Ltd. in Toronto.  The S&P/TSX has gained 14 percent this year, compared with
a 13 percent advance for the S&P 500. The Canadian index is
outgaining its U.S. counterpart for a seventh-straight year, due
in part to a 35 percent surge in raw-materials stocks. Gold and
copper have each jumped at least 28 percent this year.  The S&P/TSX has soared 49 percent since the end of 2008.
The index has not gained that much over two years since 1979-80.  Jobless Claims  First-time unemployment claims in the U.S. decreased by
34,000 to 388,000 last week, the Labor Department said in  Washington . All 28 economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast
at least 395,000 jobless claims.  Also today, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc.’s business barometer soared to its highest level since July
1988. The gauge exceeded all 49 estimates in an economist
survey.  Pending U.S. home sales rose 3.5 percent in November, more
than four times the median economist estimate in a Bloomberg
survey, the National Association of Realtors said today.  Gold futures lost 0.5 percent after rallying 2.4 percent
this week through yesterday.  Goldcorp fell 0.6 percent to C$45.34.  Barrick Gold Corp .,
the world’s largest producer of the metal, dropped 1 percent to
C$52.61.  Kinross Gold Corp ., Canada’s third-biggest producer,
decreased 0.8 percent to C$18.83.  Copper, China  Copper rose to a record in  New York  after a Chinese
purchasing managers’ index showed slower manufacturing growth,
easing concern that the nation’s interest rates will increase.  Teck gained 1.8 percent to a record C$60.96.  Western Coal
Corp ., the fuel producer being bought by Walter Energy Inc.,
advanced 1.6 percent to C$12.40.  Grande Cache Coal Corp ., which
mines in Alberta, increased 6.2 percent to C$10.49.  Crude oil declined the most in a month after the U.S.
Energy Department said inventories decreased 1.26 million
barrels last week. Analysts had forecast more than twice as
large of a drop, according the median of 14 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Cenovus dropped 0.8 percent from yesterday’s record high,
closing at C$32.95.  Crescent Point Energy Corp .., which produces
oil and gas in western Canada, retreated 1.3 percent to C$44.35.  Penn West Energy Trust , Canada’s second-largest energy trust,
slipped 1 percent to C$24.04.  Petrobank Energy & Resources Ltd., which produces oil and
gas in Canada and Colombia, rallied 3.5 percent to C$25.05.
George Toriola, an analyst at UBS AG, set a 12-month price
estimate of C$32 on the shares after yesterday’s spinoff of
Petrobank’s stake in Petrominerales Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story;
