U.S. consumers put the brakes on
dealmaking in 2010. They may be the accelerator next year.  Chief executives maintained record levels of cash this year
as the recession-weary consumer fueled doubts about an economic
recovery. While mergers and acquisitions topped $2 trillion in
2010 -- the first increase in three years -- the amount failed
to approach 2007’s $4 trillion peak in global takeovers.  Shoppers may help bring 2011 closer to that total. Holiday
sales jumped 5.5 percent in the U.S., the best performance in
five years, on purchases of clothing and jewelry, according to
MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse. As spending rises, companies
are more optimistic and willing to take on risk, according to
 Joseph Gromek , chief executive officer of New York-based Warnaco
Group Inc., owner of the Calvin Klein and Speedo  brands .  “There will be a very aggressive approach,” Gromek said.
“The companies that have strong balance sheets with lots of cash
on hand will try to be as opportunistic as possible.”  The 1,000 biggest companies worldwide, excluding financial-
services industries, have amassed more than $3 trillion in cash
and equivalents based on their latest filings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Most companies and their boards stayed conservative this
year, waiting to see how the economy rebounded before pursuing
deals, he said. Warnaco invested in its operations and foreign
distribution in 2010, and may now look at acquisitions, Gromek
said. “Interest rates are very favorable,” he said.  ‘More Prudent’  The Federal Reserve on Dec. 14 repeated its pledge to leave
the benchmark interest rate low for an “extended period.”
Former Fed Chairman  Alan Greenspan  predicts that in 2011 the
U.S. economy may grow as much as 3.5 percent, and the jobless
rate will begin to come down. Unemployment rose to 9.8 percent
in November and has hovered near  10 percent  for more than a
year, the longest stretch since monthly records began in 1948.  “Companies feel like consumers have learned to be more
prudent in their spending habits,” said  Blair Effron , who is the
co-founder of investment bank Centerview Partners and worked on
the merger of InBev and Anheuser-Busch. “In turn, companies
themselves are focused on fortified balance sheets and
liquidity.”  Effron also advised on  PepsiCo Inc.’s  $3.8 billion agreed
purchase of Russian dairy company Wimm-Bill-Dann earlier this
month. He said large companies are willing to spend the
equivalent of 10 percent to 20 percent of their market value on
a deal, leaving room for so-called tuck-ins.  Passing on Deals  In the U.S., the busiest M&A market, consumer confidence
remains subdued more than a year past the official end of the
recession. CEO confidence, as measured by the Conference Board,
declined 12 points in the third quarter. Consumer spending
accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, according to
Commerce Department  figures .  “We have passed on deals recently because we couldn’t
structure it in a way to protect us on the downside,” said
 Debra Cafaro , chairman and CEO of  Ventas Inc. , a Chicago-based
real-estate investment trust with a market value of more than $8
billion. “You have to be cautious still because of the
uncertainty in the economy and consumer spending.”  Her company in late October agreed to acquire most of the
assets of Atria Senior Living Group, a provider of housing for
seniors, for $3.1 billion including debt. Cafaro said she was
willing to make that deal “because that business is less
economically sensitive, not as tied to the consumer, as say, a
bunch of shopping malls.”  “On one side of the ledger, the financing markets are very
accommodating, giving you the green light to do a deal,” she
said, “but you have a red light, the consumer and the economy,
which holds you back.”  Fewer Megadeals  The 26 percent recovery in global M&A for 2010 didn’t live
up to the expectations of some dealmakers after a dearth of
megadeals. In 2010, only two takeovers topped $25 billion, fewer
than the four announced in 2009, according to Bloomberg data. At
the same time, the number of deals ranging from $1 billion to $5
billion in size jumped 52 percent to 369 in the same period, the
data show.  Private-equity firms have made fewer large purchases in
recent years, even though they have more than $430 billion to
invest, based on figures from Preqin Ltd. There is, however, the
capacity for more straightforward corporate takeovers that don’t
involve private equity, said  Andy Lipsky , head of Credit Suisse
Group AG’s mergers and acquisitions for the Americas.  “$10 billion strategic deals are easy now if they make
sense,” he said. Lipsky this year worked on Colombia-based
 Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores SA’s  purchase of BAC-Credomatic
GECF Inc. from General Electric Co.’s finance unit for $1.9
billion. He anticipates 2011 deal volume will rise about 20
percent in the Americas amid continuing direct investments in
emerging markets, such as China and Brazil.  Failed Takeovers  Many of 2010’s biggest deals fell through, including BHP
Billiton Ltd.’s $40 billion bid to buy Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. and Prudential Plc’s failed attempt to acquire
American International Group Inc.’s Asian business for $35.5
billion. Buyout firms had to abandon plans to take private
Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and disk-drive maker
Seagate Technology Plc.  Those who succeeded in making the biggest bets were
commodities, utilities and telecommunications companies.  Carlos Slim  orchestrated one of the year’s biggest takeovers when his
America Movil SAB, Latin America’s largest wireless carrier,
announced plans to take over two other Slim-controlled phone
companies in a deal valued at more than $20 billion. Further
down on the list, the biggest announced consumer goods deal was
Coca-Cola Co.’s $12 billion agreement to buy its largest
bottler. Companies focused mainly on smaller transactions, even
though the year began with Kraft Foods Inc. completing its
purchase of Cadbury Plc for about $18 billion.  Still Skeptical  “There’s still some skepticism that exists among CEOs in
various industries that the economy is truly back on track,”
said  Jeffrey Stute , co-head of North American M&A at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. “The consumer is an element of that skepticism,
which in part leads to CEOs being reluctant to pull the trigger
on a bet-the-company deal.”  Another banker, Barclays Capital’s global M&A head  Paul Parker , anticipates a shift toward bigger transactions with
worldwide M&A volume increasing by 15 percent a year on average
through 2012. By number of deals, Europe lagged behind North
America and Asia Pacific this year, with sovereign debt crises
suppressing cross-border and domestic takeovers in the region.  “We have an expectation that these issues will abate over
time, but they do cast some general overhang on the M&A market,”
Parker said.  Asian Growth  For the first time in 2010, acquirers spent about as much
in Asia Pacific as they did in Europe. Asia should again drive
growth in the year ahead, and a pickup of economic growth in the
U.S. would be a further impetus for dealmaking, according to M&A
bankers. Morgan Stanley’s co-president of institutional
securities,  Paul Taubman , said what’s needed in 2011 is a few
takeovers to set others in motion.  “There’s nothing like a handful of large M&A deals that
get done and are well received to induce others to consider
something similar,” Taubman said.  Through yesterday, Morgan Stanley had advised on about $469
billion in announced deals in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That makes the bank the top M&A adviser for a
second straight year, followed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
JPMorgan Chase ranked third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
