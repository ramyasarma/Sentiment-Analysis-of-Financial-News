China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group
Co. , the nation’s second-biggest atomic-plant builder, is
planning two reactors in Lufeng city to help meet rising demand
in the Chinese province of Guangdong.  Guangdong Nuclear is considering building two reactors with
capacity totaling 2,000 megawatts, the company  said  in a
statement on its website. The plant in Lufeng will be capable of
housing six 1,000-megawatt reactors, Guangdong Nuclear said.  China, the world’s largest polluter, wants at least 15
percent of its energy mix to come from non-fossil fuels by 2020
and is building more atomic plants to help meet that goal.
Guangdong Nuclear currently operates five reactors in Guangdong,
including two units at Daya Bay near Hong Kong. The company
plans to start up its sixth in the southern province next year.  Guangdong Nuclear is conducting feasibility studies on 25
reactors with capacity totaling more than 28,000 megawatts,
including the two Lufeng units, the company said.  -- Chua Baizhen . Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
