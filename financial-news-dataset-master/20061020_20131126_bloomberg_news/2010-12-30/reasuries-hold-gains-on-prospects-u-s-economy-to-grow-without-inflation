Treasuries dropped as reports showed
initial jobless claims fell more than forecast, U.S. businesses
expanded at the fastest pace in two decades and pending home
resales beat expectations.  “The economy is gaining momentum, which has provided
headwinds for bond bulls,” said John Fath, a principal at the
investment firm BTG Pactual in  New York , who helps manage
$2.5 billion. “If that continues in the new year, we should see
higher rates.”  U.S. debt also dropped after the government sold
$99 billion in three note offerings this week, capping
$2.2 trillion of note and bond auctions this year, surpassing
the $2.1 trillion record set in 2009.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note advanced two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.37 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the
2.625 percent security maturing in November 2020 decreased 1/8,
or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 25/32.  About $176 billion of Treasuries changed hands today
through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker. The
one-year average is $249 billion.  An index of Treasuries maturing in more than a year has
fallen 2.1 percent this month, according to figures compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. It’s the worst performance among 26 global sovereign-
debt indexes.  Jobless Claims  Treasuries slid after the Labor Department reported the
number of applications for jobless benefits dropped to 388,000
in the week ended Dec. 25, from 422,000 in the prior week. The
median forecast of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a decrease to 415,000 from a previously reported 420,000.  “We are seeing continuing selling pressure,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “The jobless-claims
numbers were very strong, and that bodes well for the economy.”  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s
purchasing managers’ gauge increased in December to 68.6, the
highest level since July 1988, from 62.5 in the previous month.
The median forecast of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a decrease to 61. The index has exceeded 50, signaling
expansion, since October 2009.  An index of pending home resales gained 3.5 percent in
November after jumping a record 10 percent in the prior month,
the National Association of Realtors reported. The median
forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
0.8 percent advance.  ‘Coming In Better’  “The numbers are coming in better,” said  Kevin Giddis ,
head of fixed-income sales, trading and research at Morgan
Keegan Inc. in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “If momentum builds, we’re
in more of a recovery, which should take yields higher.”  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities known as the
break-even rate, has widened to 2.29 percentage points from this
year’s low of 1.47 percentage points in August.  The yield on the 10-year note fell more than 13 basis
points yesterday, the most since June 4, after the government’s
$29 billion auction of seven-year debt drew the highest
participation from a group of investors including foreign
central banks since June 2009.  The $35 billion auction of five-year notes on Dec. 28
attracted the lowest demand since June. The same amount of
two-year notes was offered on the previous day, drawing the
highest demand in three months.  Portfolio Rebalancing  Rebalancing of portfolios may support U.S. debt prices
through year-end. The duration of Barclays Plc’s U.S. Treasury
Index will rise by 0.9 year this month, matching the historical
high for any December, according to a report from the firm
released this week. Duration measures price sensitivity to
changes in yield and is partly a function of maturity.  The 10-year note yield will decrease to 3.11 percent by
March 31, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts, with the
most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  For the first time since 2005, stocks, bonds, commodities
and the dollar have all risen for the year.  U.S. debt of all maturities has returned 5.7 percent in
2010, compared with a 9.1 return for investment-grade corporate
debt, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Last
year Treasuries lost 3.7 percent, the most since the beginning
of data in 1978.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has advanced 13 percent
this year, while IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index
has increased 2.3 percent. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
raw materials has risen 15 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
