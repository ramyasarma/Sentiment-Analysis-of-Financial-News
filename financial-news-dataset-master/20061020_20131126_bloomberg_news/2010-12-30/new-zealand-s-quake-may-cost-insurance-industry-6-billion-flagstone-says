The earthquake that struck  New
Zealand  in September may cause insurance-industry losses of as
much as $6 billion,  Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings SA  said.  The cost may be at least $4.5 billion, Flagstone said today
in a statement issued by Business Wire. Flagstone said its own
losses from the quake may be $75.5 million, higher than its
earlier estimate of $52.5 million.  Flagstone, a Luxembourg-based company founded in response
to the 2005 hurricane season, added to its protection from
natural disasters by issuing $210 million of catastrophe bonds
earlier this month. Flagstone was formed after reinsurance
losses from hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, according to its
 website .  The Sept. 4 quake damaged more than 100,000 homes and
severed water and sewage lines in and around Christchurch, New
Zealand’s second-largest city. Cost estimates have been climbing
as claims continue to come in.  Flagstone declined 16 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $12.60 at
4:46 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It has
risen 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
