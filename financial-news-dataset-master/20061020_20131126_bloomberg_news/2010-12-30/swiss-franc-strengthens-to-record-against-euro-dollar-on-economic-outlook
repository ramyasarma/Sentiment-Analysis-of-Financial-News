  Switzerland ’s franc jumped to a
record against the euro and the dollar as investors bet its
economy is set to outperform the euro zone and U.S. next year.  Over the year the franc has strengthened 8.4 percent,
according to the Bloomberg correlation-weighted currency
indexes, benefiting as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis worsened.  “The Swiss franc continues to benefit from ongoing doubts
about developments in Europe and concerns over how the debt
crisis in Europe might pan out next year,” said Michael Derks,
the head of currency strategy at FXPro Financial Services in  London . “There’s a feeling that the U.S. economy is still
rather tender and that the recovery, although looking a little
better, is still somewhat fragile and is not assured for next
year, whereas I think there’s greater confidence in
Switzerland.”  Switzerland’s currency appreciated as much as 0.8 percent
to 1.2402 per euro, breaching a record of 1.2439 on Dec. 22,
before trading at 1.2443 at 8:32 a.m. in London. Against the
dollar, it reached an all-time strength of 93.74 centimes before
trading at 93.97 centimes.  Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
