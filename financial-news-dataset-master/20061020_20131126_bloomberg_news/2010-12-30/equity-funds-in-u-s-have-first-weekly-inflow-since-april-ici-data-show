Funds that focus on U.S. equities
ended an eight-month period of withdrawals last week, signaling
investors are regaining confidence in the economic recovery,
according to estimates from the  Investment Company Institute .  Flows turned positive in the week ended Dec. 21, when
investors added $335 million to American equity funds, the
Washington-based firm said in a report yesterday. They sent $3.6
billion to U.S.-based funds that invest overseas. Before last
week, about $90 billion was pulled from U.S. equity mutual funds
since the start of May, when a 20-minute plunge briefly erased
$862 billion from the value of U.S. stocks.  Americans are coming back to stocks after the Federal
Reserve signaled it would support the economy by buying more
bonds and third-quarter earnings reports showed results that
beat estimates. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 23
percent since July 2, including a 6.7 percent advance since Nov.

better and have the sense that it’s safe to commit assets to the
equity market,” said  Hank Smith , chief investment officer at
Haverford Trust Co., which manages $6.5 billion in Radnor,  Pennsylvania . “The market is reflecting today that the double-
dip scenario is an unlikely one, and I think what’s not priced
into the market is the real possibility that GDP growth might be
a little bit better than way below average, as it’s expected.”  Annual Gain  The S&P 500 has risen 13 percent to 1,257.88 this year, and
U.S. strategists forecast it will end 2011 at 1,374, according
to the average of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Economists had cut their 2011 forecast for U.S. gross
domestic product growth to as low as 2.4 percent in November
from 3.1 percent in May, according to 65 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. They have since raised their estimate to 2.6 percent.
Growth slowed to a rate of 2.6 percent in the three months ended
in September from as much as 5 percent in the fourth quarter of
2009, less than a year earlier.  While money has been coming out of equity funds, bond funds
have seen inflows every week since the middle of December 2008,
according to ICI data. About $634 billion has gone into bond
funds January 2009, according to estimates and monthly figures
