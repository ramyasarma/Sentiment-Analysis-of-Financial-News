Republican U.S. Senator  Lisa Murkowski  of  Alaska  was certified the winner of her write-in re-
election bid after claiming victory more than a month ago over a
Tea Party rival.  Alaska Governor Sean Parnell signed the papers today,
Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell said in a telephone
interview. The state division of elections earlier certified
Murkowski’s victory in the Nov. 2 ballot against  Joe Miller . He
had defeated her in a primary vote for the Republican
nomination, leading to her write-in campaign.  A federal judge on Dec. 28 dismissed a lawsuit Miller filed
challenging the vote count. The judge’s decision followed a
ruling by the Alaska Supreme Court that the election was
conducted according to state law.  Murkowski, 53, will be sworn in along with other senators
when the chamber convenes Jan. 5. She became the first senator
to win with write-in ballots since Strom Thurmond’s victory in  South Carolina  in 1954.  Miller, 43, was backed by former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. His representatives challenged a number of the write-in
ballots for Murkowski as being misspelled or otherwise
improperly cast, and his lawsuit questioned standards used by
state election officials for deciding whether those votes are
valid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
