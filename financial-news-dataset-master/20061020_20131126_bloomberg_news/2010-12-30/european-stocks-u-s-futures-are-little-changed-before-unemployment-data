European stocks and U.S. index
futures were little changed, with the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600
Index close to the highest level since September 2008, before
reports that may provide more evidence about the strength of the
economic recovery. Asian shares rose.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.1 percent to 280.85 at 8:03 a.m. in
London, while futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also
gained 0.1 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.3
percent.  The number of contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes
probably rose in November for a fourth time in five months,
extending a recovery following a post-credit plunge, economists
said before a report today.  The index of pending resales climbed 0.8 percent after
jumping a record 10 percent in October, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast the National Association of Realtors
will report today at 10 a.m.  Separately, a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. may show
the number of applications for jobless benefits fell to 415,000
last week, near the two-year low of 410,000 reached in the
middle of last month, according to the survey median. The drop
in claims signals firings are slowing, which may precede gains
in hiring as the economy improves.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
