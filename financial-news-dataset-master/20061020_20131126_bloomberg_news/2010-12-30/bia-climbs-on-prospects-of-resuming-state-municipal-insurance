Bond insurer  MBIA Inc . gained the
most in more than two months after a court development raised
prospects it may resume guaranteeing city and state debt.  The company has held off insuring municipal bonds because
of a 2009 lawsuit by  Bank of America Corp ., JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Barclays Plc and 15 of the world’s largest financial
companies challenging MBIA’s decision to separate its municipal
bond insurance business from its structured-finance guarantees.
JPMorgan and Barclay’s are now withdrawing from the litigation.  “There is going to be a market for public finance
insurance and if the split is upheld, I think the market would
invest in a pure municipal finance insurer,” Brian Charles, an
analyst with R.W. Pressprich & Co. in  New York , said in a
telephone interview.  MBIA soared 15 percent to $11.87, the most in the Russell
1000 Index and its largest percentage jump since Oct. 14. The
shares climbed 8.8 percent yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading after the two banks withdrew from suing the
Armonk, New York-based company.  MBIA hasn’t insured municipal bonds since losing its AAA
credit ratings in 2008.  The lawsuit over dividing the company will continue for the
remaining plaintiffs, according to a filing yesterday in the New
York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan .  The case is ABN Amro Bank NV v. Eric Dinallo, 601846109,
Supreme Court of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
