Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Grupo
Financiero Inbursa SAB is paying the lowest return among Mexican
pension funds by keeping more than 50 percent of assets in local
government bills, missing out on the biggest rally in longer-
term debt since 2006.  The five funds of Afore Inbursa, as the pension division is
known, returned an average 7.06 percent annually in the 36
months ended in November, trailing the more than 9 percent
advance of top performing funds managed by  ING Groep NV  and  Citigroup Inc ., according to  data  from pension regulator Consar.  Slim’s group has 57 percent of its $9.6 billion in pension
assets in government bills that mature in less than a year
because it expects an expanding economy will prompt the central
bank to raise interest rates, hurting longer bonds, Inbursa
Chief Executive Officer Marco Antonio Slim Domit said. Mexican
T-bills yield 4.12 percent to 4.77 percent while the 10 percent
peso bond due in 2024 returned 17.3 percent this year, including
reinvested interest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There are moments to be conservative and moments to be
aggressive,” Slim Domit, who at 42 is the billionaire’s second-
eldest son, said in a Dec. 17 telephone interview from  Mexico 
City. “With interest rates, yes, we think that this is a moment
to be conservative.”  Banco de Mexico, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, will
hold the benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent, the lowest
since the bank started setting a target rate in 2005, through
the end of 2011, according to a Dec. 20 survey of 18 economists
by Citigroup’s Banamex unit.  Rates on Hold  Carstens said in a Nov. 10 interview he would consider
cutting rates should rising foreign capital inflows cause the
peso to appreciate and hurt exports. The Banamex survey shows
economists expect a rate increase in January 2012.  In the U.S., which buys 80 percent of Mexico’s exports, the
Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates near zero to stimulate
the economy. U.S. growth will slow next year to 2.6 percent from
2.8 percent in 2010 while Mexico’s expansion will ease to 3.7
percent from 5.1 percent this year, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  ING Afore, based in Mexico City, produced a 10.1 percent
average return over the past 36 months, the most among Mexico’s
14 pension funds, according to Consar data. As of Nov. 30, ING
had 21 percent of its 183 billion pesos of assets in inflation-
linked bonds, 20 percent in fixed-rate bonds, 19 percent in
equities and 0.05 percent in treasury bills.  Best Through Crisis  Citigroup’s Afore Banamex, whose average return was 9.4
percent in the period, had 23 percent of assets in inflation-
linked bonds, 21 percent in fixed-rate government bonds and 16
percent in stocks, according to Consar.  Mexico’s inflation-linked bonds returned 10.9 percent this
year through Dec. 29, including reinvested interest, according
to Barclays Plc indexes. The benchmark IPC stock index rose 19
percent in the period.  Afore Inbursa’s preference for treasury bills helped it
offer the highest returns among pension funds in late 2008 and
early 2009 during the global economic crisis. The fund has held
at least 45 percent of its assets in treasury bills since at
least March 2008, according to Consar.  In January 2008, Slim Domit said in an interview Afore
Inbursa would “go to the limit” on stocks if the benchmark IPC
index fell below 20,000. Afore Inbursa boosted its stock
allocation to 13 percent in September 2008 before beginning to
reduce the following month, when the IPC tumbled to as low as
16,868.66. The equity allocation was 8.9 percent as of Nov. 30
and the IPC closed today at 38,243.14.  ‘Slow’  “This afore is well known for being relatively slow at
moving into risky assets,” said  Alonso Cervera , chief Latin
America economist at Credit Suisse Group Ltd. in Mexico City.  The companies controlled by Carlos Slim, whose public
holdings of $65 billion make him the world’s richest man
according to Forbes magazine, have been taking advantage of low
interest rates to raise money for investments. Mobile-phone
carrier America Movil SAB sold more than $8 billion in bonds
this year in Mexico, the U.S. and  Europe . Inbursa raised $1.3
billion in the local bond market this year as it tripled
branches from the end of 2008.  Grupo Financiero Inbursa, founded 45 years ago by 70-year-
old Slim, has gained 42 percent this year, putting its market
value at $14.5 billion. Grupo Financiero Banorte SA rose 20
percent. Inbursa climbed 33 centavos to 54.09 pesos at 4 p.m.
New York time in Mexico City trading.  While a “conservative” investment strategy makes sense in
volatile markets or for workers who are close to retirement,
funds dedicated to younger clients should have a mix of
equities, structured products and infrastructure investments,
said  Gabriel Casillas , JPMorgan Chase & Co’s chief economist in
Mexico City.  Client Losses  “In a period of recovery, or in the case of a person who
has a long way before retirement, much better strategies can be
chosen that incur more risk but probably are going to produce
better returns,” said Casillas.  Inbursa’s pension fund for clients aged 26 and less has 42
percent of assets in Mexican treasury bills, compared with an
average of 2.5 percent for the 14 funds in the system. Inbursa’s
0.5 percent allocation in fixed-rate bonds compares with an
average of 29 percent for the pension industry.  Inbursa has lost about 32,000 pensioners this year for
other funds, less than 1 percent of its client base, according
to Consar data. The number of pensioners in the system rose 3.3
percent in the period, with ING Afore gaining 0.3 percent. Afore
Banamex added 4.2 percent.  “It’s good that workers are taking more time to change
accounts,” said Pedro Ordorica, president of regulator Consar.
