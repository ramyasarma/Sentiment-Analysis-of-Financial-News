Orange juice gained for the ninth
time in 10 sessions after citrus growers in  Florida , the
world’s second-biggest producer, said crops were damaged by
this week’s cold spell. Cotton rose. Coffee and cocoa fell.  In some areas, temperatures stayed below 28 degrees
Fahrenheit (-2 degrees Celsius) for more than 10 hours through
yesterday morning, enough to cause “significant damage” to
fruit, according to Ray Royce, the executive director of the
 Highlands County Citrus Growers Association . The group accounts
for about 13 percent of Florida’s production.  Orange juice for March delivery gained 2.2 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1.66 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . Prices have climbed 29 percent this year,
partly as adverse weather threatened crops in the U.S. and  Brazil , the largest grower.  “Frost will rule the market for the next couple of
months,” said Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading
Corp., a commodities brokerage in Medford,  Oregon . “Also,
there was some technical buying today.”  Prices surged to a three-year high of $1.706 on Dec. 13
after Florida declared a state of emergency amid severe cold
and prospects of crop damage.  Production Estimates  The state will produce 143 million boxes of oranges in the
harvest that began in October and runs into July, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said on Dec. 10. That’s down from an
October estimate of 146 million boxes.  In the previous season, output dropped to 133.6 million
boxes, the second-smallest crop in two decades, after a January
freeze damaged fruit. A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  Cotton futures for March delivery gained 2.4 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $1.4284 a pound on ICE. The price dropped 12
percent in the previous five sessions. The most-active contract
has surged 89 percent this year, heading for the biggest annual
gain since 1973.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 3.35 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.363 a pound in New York. On Dec. 22, the
commodity reached $2.4225, a 13-year high. The price has gained
74 percent this year, the third-biggest increase among the 19
commodities tracked by the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index,
behind cotton and silver.  In  London , robusta-coffee futures for March delivery
gained $60, or 3 percent, to $2,084 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for March delivery declined $65, or 2.1
percent, to $3,000 a ton in New York. The price has dropped 8.8
percent this year.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery dropped 30
pounds, or 1.5 percent, to 2,023 pounds ($3,120) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
