True Corp. , Thailand’s third-largest
mobile-phone operator, will acquire Hutchison Telecommunications
Investment Ltd.’s units in the Southeast Asian nation to expand
its wireless network.  True’s Real Move Co. and Real Future Co. units will pay
4.35 million baht ($144,000) for controlling stakes in four
units of Hutchison, the Bangkok-based company said in a filing
today. Real Future will also lend as much as 6.3 billion baht to
Hutchison’s BFKT (Thailand) Co. to help repay its debt,
according to the statement.  The mobile-phone carrier is spending more on expanding its
reach as it competes against larger rivals Advanced Info Service
Pcl and Total Access Communication Pcl to win subscribers. True
plans to invest as much as 4 billion baht annually between 2011
and 2013 to expand its wireless network, Chief Executive Officer
 Supachai Chearavanont  said on Nov. 22.  The acquisitions will “allow the company to utilize the
network infrastructure, increase customer base and business
growth rate,” True said in the statement.  True  shares fell 0.7 percent to 7.15 baht at the 12:30 p.m.
trading break in Bangkok. The stock has more than doubled this
year compared with a 41 percent climb by the benchmark SET Index.  -- Editors:  Suresh Seshadri ,  Garry Smith .  To contact the reporter on this story:
