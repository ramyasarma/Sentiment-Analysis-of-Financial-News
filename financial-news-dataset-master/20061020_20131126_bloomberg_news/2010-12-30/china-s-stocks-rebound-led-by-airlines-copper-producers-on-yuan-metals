China’s benchmark stock index  rose
for a second day after copper prices and the Chinese currency
rallied to record highs, bolstering the earnings outlook for the
nation’s metal producers and airlines.  Jiangxi Copper Co. , the nation’s biggest maker of the metal,
climbed to the highest in six weeks after copper prices rose to
$9,480 a metric ton in London.  China Southern Airlines Co.  and
Air China Ltd. surged more than 2 percent as the yuan advanced
to the strongest level against the dollar since the end of 1993,
reducing carriers’ U.S. debt costs. China Vanke Co. and Poly
Real Estate Group Co. slid after the 21st Business Herald
reported China won’t loosen curbs on the property market in 2011.  “Investors are sitting on the sidelines, expecting better
buying opportunities in January when liquidity increases and
banks loosen lending,” said Li Jun, a strategist at Central
China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “There may be some technical
rebound from the excessive declines but it won’t be too much.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 8.05, or 0.3 percent, to 2,759.58
at the 3 p.m. close, even as 456 stocks fell and 403 advanced.
The  CSI 300 Index  added 0.1 percent to 3,064.10. The market will
suspend trading on Jan. 3 for the New Year’s holiday.  The Shanghai measure has slumped 16 percent in 2010, the
worst performer in Asia, after rallying 80 percent last year.
The government has ordered banks to set aside more reserves six
times this year and boosted interest rates twice to tame
inflation and curb asset bubbles after record gains in lending
and property prices. China reported inflation of 5.1 percent in
November, the highest in more than two years and exceeding the
previous month’s 4.4 percent.  Records  Jiangxi Copper paced advances for copper stocks, adding 3.5
percent to 41.99 yuan. Yunnan Copper Industry Co. gained 4.8
percent to 25 yuan.  Copper prices surged on speculation the global recovery is
gaining pace and that a strengthening yuan will spur more
imports by the world’s largest consumer. Copper for three-month
delivery gained 0.9 percent on the London Metal Exchange. Copper
for March delivery in Shanghai closed the morning session 0.4
percent higher at 69,790 yuan ($10,547) a ton.  China Southern surged 4.7 percent to 9.54 yuan. China
Eastern Airlines Corp. advanced 2.1 percent to 6.45 yuan. Air
China climbed 2.4 percent to 13.41 yuan.  The yuan gained to its strongest level since the end of
1993 on speculation the central bank will permit more
appreciation next year to help curb inflation. The People’s Bank
of China today set the reference rate at the strongest level
since ending a dollar peg in July 2005.  ICBC Rally  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
largest lender by market value, advanced 3.2 percent to 4.24
yuan. The increase contributed to more than half the Shanghai
Composite’s gain today. The advance helped the gauge rebound
from a 1 percent loss earlier as a gauge of manufacturing showed
a slowdown after the government boosted rates to tame inflation.  A purchasing managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics fell to 54.4 from 55.3 in November. A
reading above 50 indicates an expansion. It’s the first time in
five months that China’s manufacturing growth slowed.  SAIC Motor Corp. , the nation’s largest auto maker by market
value, declined 2.4 percent to 14.41 yuan. FAW Car Co. dropped
1.4 percent to 15.65 yuan.  A gauge of property developers in the Shanghai gauge fell
1.5 percent.  China Vanke Co. , the largest developer, slid 1.3
percent to 8.19 yuan.  Poly Real Estate Group Co.  dropped 2.9
percent to 12.50 yuan.  Property Curbs  China won’t loosen curbs on the property market in 2011 and
will continue to crack down on speculative housing purchases,
the 21st Business Herald reported yesterday, citing  Jiang Weixin ,
minister of Housing and Urban-Development.  A  measure  tracking developers, banks and brokerages in the
CSI 300 Index fell 28 percent this year, the most among the 10
industry groups.  Haitong Securities Co.  has been the worst
performing company in the group, plunging 51 percent, as the
market’s slump this year and rising competition reduced earnings.  China’s stocks, the worst-performing equities market among
major developing countries this year, are poised to rebound in
2011 as the government keeps inflation under control, said  Mark Mobius , who oversees about $40 billion as executive chairman of
Templeton Emerging Markets Group.  Consumer prices will stay at “tolerable” levels, easing
investor concerns about excessive tightening of monetary policy
after two interest-rate increases since October, Mobius said.  “We are confident that the Chinese government has the
capability to control inflation at a reasonable level in 2011,”
Mobius said yesterday. “If China can keep the CPI at about 4
percent in 2011, the equity market should perform well.”  Best Performers  Gauges of health-care and technology companies have jumped
20 percent and 17 percent respectively in 2010, the best
performers in the CSI 300. These companies have benefited from
speculation the government’s next five-year plan will spur
spending. The government is seeking to bolster domestic
consumption and lessen its dependence on exports.  Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co., which makes rare-earth
metals, is the best-performing stock in the Shanghai gauge this
year after tripling in value. Rare-earth prices have jumped as
Chinese export quotas crimped worldwide supplies for the
elements used in the manufacture of disk drives and smart bombs.  -- Irene Shen . Editors:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
