Electricite de France SA’s agreement
to sell its stake in German utility EnBW Energie Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG has thrown EDF’s plans for a methane terminal at
Dunkirk in northern France into doubt, La Tribune reported,
without saying where it got the information.  EnBW, Total SA and Gas Natural SDG SA had each planned to
buy 2 billion cubic meters of output per year from the plant, La
Tribune said. A EnBW board, which may take up to four months to
be appointed, will have to reevaluate the project, according to
the newspaper.  The plan is also the subject of internal debate at EDF, and
Chief Executive Officer Henri Proglio is not strongly in favor,
La Tribune said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
