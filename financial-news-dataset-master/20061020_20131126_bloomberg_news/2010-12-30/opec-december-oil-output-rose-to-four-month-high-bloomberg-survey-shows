The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’  oil output climbed to a four-month high in
December, led by increases in  Nigeria  and  Iraq , as rising oil
prices encouraged production, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Production gained 135,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to an
average 29.185 million barrels a day, according to the survey of
oil companies, producers and analysts. Production by members
with quotas, all except Iraq, rose by 100,000 barrels to 26.8
million, about 2 million above their target.  Compliance with the quotas, which took effect in January
2009 to strengthen oil prices that had tumbled to below $40 a
barrel, was 53 percent in December, down from 56 percent in
November. Prices have risen 6.8 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  so far this month and touched a 26-month
high of $91.88 a barrel on Dec. 27.  Nigeria’s output surged by 100,000 barrels a day to 2.22
million, a four-year high, according to the survey. It was the
largest increase by any member.  Africa’s biggest producer exceeded its quota by 547,000
barrels, the largest of any member as producers recovered from
disruptions in November. Those included a force majeure on
production of Bonny Light crude due to a leak in the Trans-Niger
pipeline and militant attacks earlier in the month that lowered
output on both the Oso and Okoro fields.  Iraqi Output  Iraq, OPEC’s third-largest producer after  Saudi Arabia  and  Iran , pumped an average 2.39 million barrels a day, up 35,000
barrels a day from November, according to the survey. Iraqi oil
production exceeded 2.6 million barrels a day for the first time
in 20 years, newly appointed Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al- Luaibi said this week at a press conference in  Baghdad .  Angola cut output by 30,000 barrels to 1.7 million, the
biggest reduction of any member. The country pumped 183,000
barrels a day above its target.  Iran pumped 25,000 barrels a day less in December than
November, bringing the average to 3.7 million barrels a day.
That remains 364,000 barrels over its quota, the second-largest
overproduction level by any member.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest oil producer, boosted output
by 15,000 barrels in December to 8.25 million barrels a day, or
199,000 above its quota.  To contact the reporters on this story:
