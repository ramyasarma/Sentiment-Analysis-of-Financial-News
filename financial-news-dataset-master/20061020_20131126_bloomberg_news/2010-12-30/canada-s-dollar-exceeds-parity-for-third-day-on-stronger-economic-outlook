Canada’s dollar touched a level
beyond parity with its U.S. counterpart for a third consecutive
day on speculation the global economic recovery will strengthen
in 2011, making growth-linked currencies more attractive.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, has gained 3
percent in 2010, the sixth-best performance in a measure of 10
developed-nation currencies, Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes showed.  Australia ’s dollar rose 12 percent,
while the  U.S. dollar  fell 2.8 percent. U.S. businesses
unexpectedly expanded in December at the fastest pace in 22
years, data showed.  “The pick-up in the U.S. economy will be a benefit to our
domestic economy,”  Steve Butler , director of foreign-exchange
trading in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit,
said via e-mail. “We’ve been stuck essentially in a 20-point
range for two days now. I expect it to break once we get into
the new year.”  The Canadian currency rose 0.1 percent to C$1 per U.S.
dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0009 yesterday.
It gained as much as 0.2 percent to 99.91 cents per U.S. dollar.  The loonie remained stronger as data showed first-time
claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S., Canada’s biggest
trade partner, declined to the lowest level since July 2008 and
a gauge of U.S. business unexpectedly climbed.  The claims decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended
Dec. 25, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .  Highest Since 1988  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
business barometer rose to 68.6 this month, the highest level
since July 1988, from 62.5 in November. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey was for a drop to 61.  Italian business confidence rose this month to the highest
in almost three years, Isae institute date showed, helping to
boost demand for currencies that benefit from global growth.  “The economic optimism going into the calendar year-end
and beyond will likely contribute to more risk-related activity
in currency markets, which should benefit the Canadian dollar,”  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at  National
Bank of Canada , said by phone from Toronto.    Canada ’s currency fell against 11 of its 16 most-traded
peers today, sliding the most against  Brazil ’s real while
appreciating the most versus the pound. The loonie has risen 2.6
percent in December versus the greenback. It has gained the most
this month versus the pound, 3.4 percent, and fallen the most
against the Swiss franc, 4.5 percent.  2010 Performance  For the year, the Canadian dollar, called the loonie for
the image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, has strengthened
against seven of its major counterparts. It advanced the most
against the Danish krone, 12 percent, and fell the most versus
the yen, 8.4 percent.  The loonie will trade at parity with its U.S. counterpart
at the end of March, weaken to $1.01 per greenback by June, and
end 2011 at parity, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 29 economists and analysts.  Government bonds were little changed today. The two-year
note yielded 1.70 percent after reaching 1.77 percent yesterday,
the highest level since July 9. The 1.5 percent security due in
December 2012 slipped one cent to C$99.63. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. The 10-year note yielded 3.15 percent.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 5.9 percent in
2010, after losing 1.5 percent last year, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index. The securities gained 12 percent in
2008. Global sovereign bonds are up 3.5 percent this year,
according to a separate Merrill Lynch index.  Canadian corporate debt has returned 7.1 percent this year,
and provincial bonds have gained 7 percent.  Crude oil for February delivery traded at $89.43 a barrel
in  New York , down 1.9 percent. It rose to $91.88 on Dec. 27, the
highest level since Oct. 7, 2008. Canada is the largest supplier
of crude to the U.S.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
