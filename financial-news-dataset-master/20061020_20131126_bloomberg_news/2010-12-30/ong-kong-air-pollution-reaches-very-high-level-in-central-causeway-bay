Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at two of the city’s three roadside monitoring
stations, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website today.  The index was 150 in Central and 120 in Causeway Bay as of
6 a.m. local time, the department said. The index for Mong Kong
was ‘high’ at 69. Roadside pollution above 100 triggers a
government warning for people with heart or respiratory
illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
