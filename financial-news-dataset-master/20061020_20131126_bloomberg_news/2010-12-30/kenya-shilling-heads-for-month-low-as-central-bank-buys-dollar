     Dec. 30 (Bloomberg) --The Kenyan shilling depreciated for
the third straight day, poised for the lowest close in more than
four weeks, as the central bank bought dollars to boost foreign-
exchange reserves.  The East African nation’s currency slid 0.1 percent to
80.80 per dollar at 4:13 p.m. in Nairobi. A close at that level
would be the weakest since Dec. 1. Kenya’s shilling closed at
80.70 per dollar yesterday.  The “central bank decision to buy dollars increased
pressure on the shilling,”  Joel Mbuvi , head of treasury at
African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview from Nairobi.
Businesses buying dollars to cover year-end invoices are also
weakening the currency, which is likely to depreciate to beyond
81 per dollar, he said.  The Central Bank of Kenya today bought $8 million in the
domestic foreign-exchange market at 80.76 shillings per dollar,
the lender said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
