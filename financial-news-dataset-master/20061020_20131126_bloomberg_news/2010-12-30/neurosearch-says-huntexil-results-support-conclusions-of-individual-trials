NeuroSearch A/S said the results of
a meta-analysis with its Huntexil treatment for Huntington’s
disease support the conclusions drawn from each individual
trial, with better precision due to the larger number of
observations.  NeuroSearch now plans to present and discuss the Huntexil
data with regulators during the first half of 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
