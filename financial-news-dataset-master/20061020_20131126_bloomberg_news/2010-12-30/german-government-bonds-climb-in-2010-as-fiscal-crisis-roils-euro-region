German bunds climbed this year, the
best performance since 2008, as the fiscal crisis that roiled
the euro area’s most-indebted nations drove investors to the
safest fixed-income assets in the region.  Top-rated euro-denominated securities from Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and France led gains in 2010,
while the debt of Greece and Ireland, which sought bailouts this
year, had the biggest losses among 26 markets tracked by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Bunds slid in the fourth quarter by the most since
June 2008 amid signs the global economy is strengthening and
concern German costs for helping fellow euro-member states may
escalate in 2011.  “There has been a flight-to-quality and Europe has been
divided between the haves and the have-nots,” said  Orlando Green , assistant director of capital-markets strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The have-nots
are clearly the likes of Greece and Ireland, and they needed to
be bailed out. The risk going into next year is that this domino
effect could continue.”  The yield on the  10-year bund  fell six basis points to
2.95 percent as of 4:56 p.m. in London. It’s down from 3.39
percent on Dec. 30, 2009, according to Bloomberg generic data.
The yield increased 44 basis points last year, and slid 136
basis points in 2008 as the global financial crisis erupted. The
price of the 2.5 percent security maturing in January 2021 rose
0.53, or 5.3 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,328) face amount, to
96.13 today.  Greek Deficit  German bonds returned a profit of almost 6 percent this
year, according to the Bloomberg/EFFAS data, compared with a 20
percent loss on Greek debt, a 14 percent slump in Irish
securities and an 8 percent decline for Portuguese securities.
Spanish and Italian bonds also made a loss as investors
demanded increasing yields to own the debt of the euro area’s
high-deficit nations.  The region’s sovereign debt crisis took hold at the end of
2009 after Greece’s newly elected socialist Pasok government
said the budget deficit was twice as big as the previous
administration disclosed. In April, Greece asked to tap a
110 billion-euro loan facility from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund after being shut out of the debt
markets.  Borrowing Costs  As borrowing costs climbed again amid a wave of sovereign
downgrades that saw Greek debt cut to non-investment grade
at Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s, Ireland
opted on Nov. 28 to follow Greece, accepting an 85 billion-euro 
bailout. That, too, failed to prevent the spread of the debt 
crisis, fueling investor concern that Europe’s stronger nations 
may be unwilling or unable to foot the cost of future rescues.  The cost of insuring Portuguese, Spanish and Italian bonds
climbed to records as investors bet a 750 billion-euro
financial lifeline created by the EU and IMF would not be enough
to ward off defaults, undermining confidence in euro-denominated
debt. Purchases of 73.5 billion euros of bonds by the European
Central Bank and a delay in its plan to end extraordinary
monetary stimulus measures also failed to prevent debt yields 
from rising.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
government bonds instead of German bunds, Europe's benchmark 
government securities, surged to a euro-era record of 973 basis 
points on May 7, and was at 953 basis points today. It started 
the year at 239 basis points. The difference in yield, or spread, 
between German bonds and 10-year debt from Ireland, Portugal, 
Spain and Italy also reached euro-era records.  Debt Insurance  The cost of insuring sovereign debt surged more than
200 percent since the start of the year, according to the
benchmark Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments.  Five-year contracts insuring $10 million of debt have
climbed to almost $210,000 a year compared with less than
$69,000 on Jan. 1.  While investor demand for the safest fixed-income assets
during the debt crisis pushed the yield on the bund to a record-
low 2.087 percent on Aug. 31, German debt slumped in the fourth
quarter. The yield has increased 67 basis points since the end
of September.  Yield Discount  Still, the yield discount for bunds compared with similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries has increased to 40 basis points from a
low for the year of four basis points on Oct. 20 as Federal
Reserve asset purchases stoked bets for stronger growth next
year. The Stoxx Europe 600  Index  of shares surged 6.7 percent so
far this quarter, headed for a gain of 9.5 percent for the year.  The bund yield may rise to 3.28 percent by the end of 2011, 
according to the average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Spain’s 10-year yield may fall to 4.43 percent, a
separate survey showed. The Spanish security’s yield was
5.49 percent today.  Total euro government issuance may reach 863 billion euros
next year, said Morgan Stanley strategist  Elaine Lin  in London.
While that’s down from 925 billion euros in 2010, it is
“elevated compared to historical levels,” and higher than the
average from 2000 to 2008, she said.  “Each auction or each redemption date will be accompanied
by significant selling pressure on the respective yield
curves,” said  Michael Leister , fixed-income analyst at WestLB
AG in Dusseldorf, Germany. He expects the 10-year bund yield to
reach 4 percent by the end of 2011.  “There’s a great deal of political uncertainty as well as
a constant risk of negative ratings headlines,” Leister said.
“Even at these levels, we still see potential for spreads to
widen again.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
