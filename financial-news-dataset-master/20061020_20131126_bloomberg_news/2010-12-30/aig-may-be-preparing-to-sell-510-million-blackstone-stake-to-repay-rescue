  American International Group Inc .,
the insurer that is divesting assets to repay billions of
dollars in U.S. government aid, may be preparing to sell a $510
million dollar stake in  Blackstone Group LP .  AIG, based in New York, notified Blackstone earlier this
month that it will convert 35.7 million Blackstone partnership
units into common shares, according to a Schedule 13G filed Dec.
17 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Blackstone
common shares, unlike the partnership units, trade on the  New
York  Stock Exchange.  AIG, led by  Robert Benmosche , is selling assets to repay a
$182.3 billion U.S. rescue. AIG reaped a combined $36.7 billion
by divesting its two largest overseas life-insurance divisions,
AIA Group Ltd. and American Life Insurance Co., the firm said
last month.  In September, the insurer agreed to sell two Japanese units
for $4.8 billion, and Benmosche is seeking a buyer for Nan Shan
Life Insurance Co. of  Taiwan .  Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, and  Peter Rose , a spokesman
for Blackstone, declined to comment.  AIG’s investment in Blackstone dates to July 1998, when the
insurer announced that it would pay $150 million to acquire a 7
percent stake in the buyout firm, formed by Peter Peterson and  Stephen Schwarzman  in 1985 to provide merger advice. At the
time, AIG also committed $1.2 billion to Blackstone buyout
funds, the first of which was formed in 1987.  December Sale  In tandem with its June 2007 initial public offering,
Blackstone said its existing owners, including Schwarzman and
Peterson, would receive about $4.57 billion in cash and 847
million units in what are now four holding partnerships for the
buyout firm’s operations. AIG was slated to receive 48.8 million
partnership units at the time, according to a prospectus filed
with the SEC on June 25, 2007.  The partnership units are exchangeable for common shares on
a one-for-one basis. Blackstone had more than 700 million
partnership units outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to the
firm’s most recent quarterly report.  AIG in November notified Blackstone that it would exchange
10 million of its partnership units for an equal number of
common shares, according to the Schedule 13G filed earlier this
month. AIG received the 10 million shares on Dec. 15 and sold
them the same day for $13.41 each, or a total of $134.1 million,
according to a Form 4 filed with the SEC.  On Dec. 9, AIG notified Blackstone that it would exchange
the remainder of its stake, consisting of 35.7 million
partnership units, for common stock. AIG expects to receive the
common shares on Feb. 9, according to the Schedule 13G.  AIG’s exchange of a combined 45.7 million partnership units
will increase the number of Blackstone common shares outstanding
by about 18 percent to 304.3 million, according to the Schedule
13G. The 35.7 million shares that Blackstone will receive equal
about 11.7 percent of the outstanding common stock, adjusted for
the conversions.  Blackstone common shares have increased about 9 percent so
far this year. They fell 7 cents to $14.29 at 12:46 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At that price,
AIG’s 35.7 million shares would be worth more than $510 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
