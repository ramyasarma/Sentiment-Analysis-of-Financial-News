Bolivian protesters today looted
government offices, burned vehicles and blocked roads after
President  Evo Morales  said he will spend $380 million that was
used to subsidize fuel to purchase grains from local farmers.  The government, which on Dec. 26 raised gasoline prices by
as much as 82 percent, will pay Bolivian soybean, corn, wheat
and rice farmers 10 percent more than market rates, Morales said
last night in a televised speech. Wages for police, state health
workers and teachers will also be increased by 20 percent next
year, he said.  “This price increase is tough for Bolivian families, but
the subsidy means we lose $150 million a year in contraband,”
Morales said.  Morales, 51, who took office in 2006 vowing greater state
control over the economy, has faced unrest as food and energy
shortages increase and private investment dwindles. Bus drivers
staged a second strike this week, protesters smashed La Paz
municipal offices and  toll booths  and battled police in cities
including Cochabamba, La Paz-based Radio Panamericana reported.  Private oil and gas investment in  Bolivia  plunged 69
percent to $271 million in 2009 from $865 million a decade
earlier, according to state-controlled energy company YPF
Bolivianos.  Workers at Bolivia’s state-run Huanuni tin mine plan to
strike Jan. 3 to protest the fuel price increase. The 175,000-
member Bolivian Confederation of Drivers, Bolivia’s largest
labor union, known as COB, and La Paz Mayor Luis Revilla also
held  protests  this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
