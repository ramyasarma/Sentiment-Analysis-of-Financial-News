Stanford University will try
tonight to complete bookends around the University of
Connecticut’s record 90-game women’s basketball winning streak,
just as Notre Dame did to UCLA’s men in the 1970s.  Stanford is the last team to defeat the Huskies, winning
at the 2008 national championship semifinals. The Cardinal will
be on their home court at the 7,329-seat Maples Pavilion as
they try to end Connecticut’s undefeated run.  The  John Wooden -coached UCLA teams, whose mark of 88
straight wins was eclipsed last week by the Huskies, lost to
Notre Dame on either side of their streak in 1971-74.  “I’m excited about it,” Maya Moore, Connecticut’s career
scoring leader and the reigning two-time national player of the
year, told reporters. “What better situation could you ask
for? It’s going to be a battle, but that’s exactly the kind of
game we want.”  The last time the teams met was in the 2010 national
championship game in April, won 53-47 by Connecticut for its
second straight title. Stanford’s only losses in a 36-2 record
last season were both to the Huskies.  Stanford (8-2) has its own streak going, having won 51
straight games at home since March 2007. The Huskies (12-0)
will be making their first visit to the northern California
school since 1993.  The Cardinal’s  Tara VanDerveer  is one of the few college
coaches who can boast more victories than Connecticut’s  Geno Auriemma . VanDerveer, 57, has 801 wins in 32 seasons. Auriemma,
56, is in his 26th season and has won 747 games.  Auriemma has seven national titles. VanDerveer has two,
the latest in 1992. Connecticut, which has won by 10 or more
points in 88 of the 90 victories during its streak, has
outscored opponents by an average of 33 points per game during
the run.  No ‘Intimidation Factor’  “Our team has had experience playing against UConn,”
VanDerveer said. “It’s not like this game will be our first
time. There isn’t that intimidation factor.”  The Huskies likely will be missing the quickness of Lorin
Dixon, a reserve guard who sprained her left foot during
practice earlier this week, and Auriemma said he’s worried
about matching up with Stanford’s tall front line.  The Cardinal feature 6-foot-4 Kayla Pedersen, Joslyn
Tinkle (6-3) and sisters Nnemkadi (6-2) and Chiney (6-3)
Ogwumike. Connecticut starts three players shorter than 6 feet.  “It’s going to be very difficult for us to match up with
them,” Auriemma told reporters. “We can’t get any bigger and
we just got a lot slower.”  Huskies’ Freshmen  Plus, the Huskies start two freshmen, guard Bria Hartley
and center Stefanie Dolson. Moore is Connecticut’s only senior
starter.  “This is our first real test (this season) against a
great team on their home court,” Auriemma said. “I hope they
(freshmen) respond the way I want them to, but you’re just
never sure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
