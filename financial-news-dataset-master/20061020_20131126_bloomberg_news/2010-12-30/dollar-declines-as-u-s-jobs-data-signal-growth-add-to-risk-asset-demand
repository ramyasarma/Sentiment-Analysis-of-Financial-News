The dollar fell against most of its
major counterparts as economic data signaled the world’s largest
economy is accelerating into the new year, encouraging demand
for currencies in nations with higher-yielding assets.  The U.S. currency weakened after economic reports showed
business expansion, fewer jobless claims and more pending home
sales. Canada’s currency traded above parity with the greenback
for the third day. The Swiss franc climbed to a record versus
the euro, pound and dollar. The  International Monetary Fund 
announced it decreased the weight the dollar and yen make up in
the basket that makes up its currency unit.  “The market prefers to be in currencies that are driven by
fundamentals and that’s buying commodity currencies,” said  John McCarthy , director of currency trading at ING Groep NV in New
York. “The data, which one would ultimately assume is positive
for the U.S., looks better for risk, which in turn puts downward
pressure on the dollar.”  The dollar weakened 0.5 percent to $1.3291 per euro at 5:01
p.m. in New York, from $1.3225 yesterday. It fell 0.1 percent to
81.53 yen after touching 81.29 yen, the lowest since Nov. 9,
from 81.62 yen yesterday.  The U.S. currency declined 1.1 percent against the franc to
93.53 centimes from 94.56 centimes, after touching a record low
of 93.51 centimes. The franc appreciated as much as 0.8 percent
to a record 1.2402 against the euro and as much as 1.7 percent
to 1.4402 per pound.  IMF Basket  The IMF said the value of its Special Drawing Right, the
institution’s currency unit, will amount to the sum of $0.66,
0.423 euro, 0.111 British pound and 12.1 yen. The announcement
made today results from a review last month.  The Dollar Index, which  IntercontinentalExchange Inc . uses
to track the dollar against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, slipped 0.4 percent to 79.499. The measure is
headed for a 2.1 percent gain in 2010.  Business in the U.S. expanded in December at the fastest
pace in 22 years. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc. said today its business barometer rose to 68.6 this month,
exceeded the most optimistic forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and the highest level since July 1988.  Initial U.S. jobless claims fell last week to the lowest
level since July 2008, a sign that the labor market is improving
heading into 2011. The number of contracts to buy previously
owned homes in the U.S. rose last month for the fourth time in
five months, the National Association of Realtors reported.    Brazil ’s real was among the best performing currency
against the  U.S. dollar  today, surging as much as 1.1 percent to
1.6600 per dollar as the nation’s central bank said it would buy
dollars in the spot market today. The currency headed for its
second straight year of gains against the dollar, rising 5.1
percent. It has increased 39 percent since 2008.  Brazil Reaction  “The Brazilians are uncomfortable every time we’ve seen
the real strengthen,” said Paresh Upadhyaya, head of Americas
G-10 currency strategy at Bank of America Corp. in  New York .  Brazil’s benchmark interest rate is 10.75 percent after the
central bank raised borrowing costs 2 percentage points this
year to try to curb foreign investment.    South Korea ’s won gained the most in two months versus the
dollar as the nation’s central bank forecast its current-account
surplus will widen. The nation’s industrial output expanded 10.4
percent in November from a year earlier, its 17th straight
increase, Statistics Korea said in Gwacheon today.  South Korea’s currency rose for a fourth day, gaining 1
percent, the most since Oct. 6, to 1,134.85 per dollar.  The dollar will keep its reserve status in 2011 because
China and  Europe  aren’t developed enough for their currencies to
replace it, said Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs
the world’s biggest bond fund.  Reserve Status  “Rising powers such as  China  are not yet ready to absorb
the $9 trillion in reserve assets the world holds, particularly
because their bond markets are immature,”  Anthony Crescenzi , a
money manager at Pimco in  Newport Beach ,  California , wrote in a
report yesterday. “Europe, amid all of its financial woes,
isn’t even close to ready to take the mantle.”  Europe’s 16-nation currency, which will add  Estonia  to its
members in January, headed for a 10.5 percent decline in 2010,
according to the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The
gauge tracks the performance of 10 developed-world currencies.
The index shows the dollar down 2.8 percent and the yen up 12.6
percent.  The euro has been the worst-performing major currency
against the dollar in 2010, sliding 7.2 percent. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the shared currency slipping to
$1.31 by the end of 2011. Its performance is followed by the
pound, which is headed for a loss 4.6 percent.  Big Win  The biggest winner against the greenback this year has been
the yen soaring 14.1 percent. The median estimate by 36
economists sees the Japanese currency retracing to 90 in the
fourth quarter of next year.  The Australian dollar was the second-best performer against
the greenback, climbing 13.3 percent. Today it touched the
strongest level against the U.S. currency since it became free-
floating in 1983.  The Swiss franc jumped on bets the nation’s economy will
outperform rivals and its central bank may increase  interest
rates  before the  European Central Bank  or Federal Reserve.  The nation’s leading economic indicator, which aims to
predict the economy’s direction about six months ahead, was 2.1
in December, the KOF research institute in Zurich said
yesterday, matching analyst estimates. The 10-year average for
the gauge is 1.13.  Canada’s currency traded stronger than parity for the third
consecutive day as U.S. business, the largest destination for
the country’s exports, picked up. Interest rates are 1 percent
in Canada compared with the near zero in the U.S.  The loonie gained as much as 0.2 percent to 99.91 cents per
U.S. dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
