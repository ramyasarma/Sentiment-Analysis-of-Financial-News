International Monetary Fund chief
economist  Olivier Blanchard  said that he foresees a “two-
speed” economic recovery next year and beyond.  “The two-speed recovery, low in advanced countries, fast
in emerging-market countries, is striking and its features are
increasingly stark,” Blanchard said in  comments  distributed by
e-mail by the IMF today in Washington. “They will probably
dominate 2011, and beyond.”  In other comments, Blanchard said that exchange rate
adjustment is an “integral part” of global rebalancing, and
that he suspects current fears about the banking system are
“overstated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
