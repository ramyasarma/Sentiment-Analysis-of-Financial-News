Formosa Petrochemical Corp. ,
Taiwan’s only publicly traded oil refiner, said it’s using 98
percent to 99 percent of capacity at its three ethylene plants.  “We’re running at almost full capacity,”  Lin Keh-yen , a
company spokesman, said by telephone in Taipei today. The
refiner expects to process an average 460,000 barrels of crude a
day this month and in January, he said.  Formosa Petrochemical’s  540,000 barrel-a-day Mailiao
refinery has three crude distillation units, each capable of
processing 180,000 barrels a day. It owns three naphtha-
processing  plants  with a combined annual capacity of 2.935
million metric tons of ethylene, a raw material for plastics,
chemicals and synthetic fibers.  “The market is O.K.,” Lin said. “We need to satisfy our
customers’ needs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
