  New Zealand  may review share
purchase laws after a Christchurch businessman offered to buy
stakes in publicly-traded companies from thousands of investors
at less than their market value, the  New Zealand Herald 
reported.  The regulator could make it harder to access share
registers and require disclosure of true market values in such
offers, the Auckland-based paper reported, citing a Radio New
Zealand interview with a  Securities Commission  director. The
offers were made this week at up to two thirds of their market
value, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
