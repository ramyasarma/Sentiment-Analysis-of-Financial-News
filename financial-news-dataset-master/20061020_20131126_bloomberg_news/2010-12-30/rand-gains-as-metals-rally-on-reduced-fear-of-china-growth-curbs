South African bonds climbed the most
in three weeks, reducing yields to a four-week low, as reports
signaled the global recovery is expanding, raising demand for
higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rose
34 cents to 124.09 rand by 5:34 p.m. in Johannesburg, cutting
the yield by 7.9 basis points to 7.341 percent, the lowest since
Dec. 3. The rand appreciated as much as 1.2 percent to 6.5826,
the strongest since November 2007, before trading 0.1 percent
weaker at 6.6660 from a yesterday’s close of 6.6609.  Initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell to the lowest level
since July 2008, Labor Department figures showed today. Korea’s
won strengthened the most since Oct. 6 after a report showed
industrial output rose for a 17th month. Copper climbed to
records in New York and London after a report showed that
China’s manufacturing is growing, signaling more demand for
industrial metals.  “South African bonds offer a great yield pick-up and
that’s what investors are looking for in this environment,”
said Werner Gey van Pittius, who helps manage about $70 billion
as a portfolio manager at  Investec Asset Management in London.  The yield on South Africa’s benchmark bond has dropped 1.05
percentage points this year as near-zero interest rates in
developed countries encouraged investors to place their money in
higher-yielding emerging markets, a strategy known as the carry
trade. Central bank rates as low as 0.1 percent in Japan and
0.25 percent in the U.S. compare with deposit returns of 5.5
percent in South Africa, even after nine reductions since
December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
