India’s power ministry may soon win
environmental approval for the allocation of coal to a 4,000
megawatt plant in Orissa state and will likely open the bidding
to companies by the end of January, a government official said.  “We are very close to an agreement with the environment
ministry,” power secretary  P. Uma Shankar  said by telephone
today. “We will meet again this week to finalize things.”  Bids for the project in Orissa’s Sundargarh district were
first sought in June and the deadline was extended three times,
with no reason stated. India has so far awarded four of nine
plants, known as ultra mega power projects, in an effort to
reduce a shortage of power.  Reliance Power Ltd.  won bids for three of the projects and
Tata Power Co. was awarded one.  Environment minister  Jairam Ramesh  wasn’t immediately
available for comment.  The last day for bid for the Orissa project is Jan. 31,
according to the  website  of state-owned Power Finance Corp.,
which is managing the tendering process. India is also seeking
bids for a similar-sized project in Chhattisgarh state, for
which the deadline is Jan. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
