             Tesco Plc  Chief Executive Officer
 Terry Leahy  was “positive as always about the business” during
a brokerage meeting today, spokesman  Trevor Datson  said.  
 Credit Suisse told clients by e-mail today that its sales
force met Leahy and that the grocery company’s shares offer a
“buying opportunity.” Datson said by phone that the Cheshunt,
England-based retailer doesn’t “release new news on broker
visits.”  
 Tesco shares partially recovered from a drop of as much as
3.1 percent and were down 2.55 pence, or 0.7 percent, at 377.5
pence as of 4:40 p.m. in London. About 53.4 million shares had
changed hands, more than double the  daily average  in the last
six months. The  shares  have fallen 17 percent since reaching the
highest in more than two years on April 26.  
 Andrew Kasoulis , Credit Suisse’s food retailing analyst in
London, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  
 The retailer, Britain’s biggest, last month repeated a
forecast for growth of 3 percent in sales at U.K. stores open at
least a year, excluding gasoline and value-added tax. Revenue on
that basis rose 0.1 percent in the 13 weeks ended May 30.  
 Leahy is due to step down in March and be succeeded by  Phil Clarke , the head of Tesco’s operations in Asia and Europe.
