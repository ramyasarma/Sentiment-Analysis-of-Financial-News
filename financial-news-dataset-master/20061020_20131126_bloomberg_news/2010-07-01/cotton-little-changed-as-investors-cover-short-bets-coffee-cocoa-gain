                  July 1 (Bloomberg)-- Cotton was little changed, erasing an
earlier drop, as speculative investors unwound bets on a price
decline. Cocoa and coffee also gained.  
 Cotton futures rebounded after export sales rose from a
week earlier, said analyst  Sid Love , the president of  Joe Kropf 
& Sid Love Consulting Services Inc. Exporters sold 116,700 bales
in the week ended on June 24, up 39 percent from a week earlier,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today.  
 “We have a holiday coming up, so I think we have some
short-covering coming up,” Love said from Overland Park,
Kansas. “You can’t have everything going down, and not every
day.”  
 Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.07 cent to
76.45 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
touching 75.17 cents, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since June 7.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery gained $97, or 3.3
percent, to $3,041 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
On London’s Liffe exchange, cocoa futures rose 34 pounds, or 1.4
percent, to 2,408 pounds ($3,651) a ton.  
 Arabica coffee futures for September delivery added 2.4
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.6825 a pound in New York.
