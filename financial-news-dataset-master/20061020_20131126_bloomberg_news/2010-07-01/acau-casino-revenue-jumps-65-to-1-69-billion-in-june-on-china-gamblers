             Macau’s  casino revenue  declined 20
percent in June from the previous month as the World Cup kept
some gamblers away from card games and slot machines in the
world’s biggest betting hub.  
 Gambling revenue for casinos in the city fell to 13.6
billion patacas ($1.69 billion) in June from 17.1 billion
patacas in May, according to  Macau’s Gaming Inspection and
Coordination Bureau .  SJM Holdings Ltd. , the casino operator with
the biggest market share in Macau, fell the most in five months
on Hong Kong’s stock market.  
 The city’s gambling industry will continue to be hurt by
“temporary softness in VIP gaming as the World Cup approaches
its final stages,” Deutsche Bank AG analyst  Karen Tang  said in
a note to clients last night. “We expect market growth to
resume sequentially in August which is traditionally the summer
travel season.”  
 Police in Hong Kong, an hour’s ferry ride from Macau, have
set up a task force to crack down on illegal football betting
during the World Cup, the Standard newspaper reported in May.
Authorities have seized HK$170 million ($22 million) in records
of illegal bets on football in two locations, the South China
Morning Post reported June 28. The World Cup’s final game this
year is on July 11.  
 Junket Operators  
 China’s  economic growth , coupled with a  lending  boom, has
fueled a boom in revenue for casinos in the only place in the
country where they are legal. Junket operators, who bring high-
limit gamblers to Macau and lend them money, have benefited from
a “sudden increase” in credit, Deutsche Bank’s  Tang  said in a
June 11 report.  
 SJM  dropped 6.7 percent to HK$6.15 in Hong Kong trading,
the biggest decline since Jan. 27. That cut this year’s  gain  of
billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s casino company to 44 percent, compared
with a 9 percent slide for the  Hang Seng Index .  
 CLSA Ltd.’s Macau Gaming Index had outperformed Hong Kong’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  by 40 percent this year as of June 25,
according to a note to clients from analyst  Aaron Fischer .  
 “Growth in Macau should moderate,” said  Jonathan Galaviz ,
an independent gambling industry strategist. “Macau is becoming
overly reliant on casino revenue and taxes.”  
 Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd.  slid 6.8 percent, the most
since Oct. 29, to HK$3.95, paring its gain this year to 23
percent.  Sands China Ltd. , the unit of billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s  Las Vegas Sands Corp. , slid 4.4 percent.  Wynn Macau
Ltd. , the unit of the casino company founded by billionaire
 Steve Wynn , dropped 3 percent.  
 Market Share  
 Melco International Ltd. , one of the partners that control
 Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. , declined 1.6 percent, extending
its retreat this year to 14.8 percent. It’s the only Hong Kong-
listed Macau casino operator to have declined since the start of
2010.  
 SJM  had 30.3 percent of Macau’s casino gambling market,
followed by  Sands China  at 21 percent, according to estimates by
CLSA’s Fischer. Wynn ranked third with 17 percent and Melco
Crown had 13.5 percent.  
 MGM Mirage’s venture with  Pansy Ho  had 7.5 percent, said
Fischer, who said gambling growth in Macau was hurt by the World
Cup. Pansy Ho, the daughter of Stanley Ho, is also managing
director of the billionaire’s Shun Tak Holdings Ltd., a ferry
operator and property developer.  
 Macau casino gambling revenue  surged 57 percent in the
first quarter to about 41 billion patacas as China’s  economic
growth  accelerated to 11.9 percent, the fastest pace in almost
three years.  
 High Rollers  
 Last month’s number, which is 65 percent higher than June
last year’s, means second-quarter revenue for casinos in the
former Portuguese colony increased 77 percent to 44.9 billion
patacas, according to Bloomberg calculations using data on the
gambling regulator’s  website . The total for the first half rose
67 percent to 85.9 billion patacas.  
 “While a huge growth number, this is probably a tad
lighter than expected,” said Fischer, who added he expected
Macau’s June casino revenue to show a year-on-year increase of
70 percent to 75 percent.  
 Revenue growth from high rollers placing wagers at baccarat
tables where the lowest bet per hand is 10,000 patacas was about
124 percent in May compared with 58 percent for “mass-market”
bettors, Deutsche Bank’s Tang had said in a separate note. The
bets at Macau’s “VIP tables” can go up to as much as 2 million
patacas a hand.  
 China’s lending boom has boosted the capital of junket
operators, who also act as debt collectors and receive
commissions from casinos.  
 VIP gamblers contribute about 70 percent of Macau’s
gambling revenue, CLSA analysts Fischer and  Huei Suen Ng 
estimate.  
 At Galaxy’s flagship casino StarWorld, high-limit tables
account for 85 percent of revenue, according to Chief Financial
Officer  Robert Drake .  
 Macau surpassed the Las Vegas Strip as the world’s biggest
gambling hub in 2006. Macau’s casinos had a record 119 billion
patacas in revenue last year, 9.7 percent higher than in 2008.
