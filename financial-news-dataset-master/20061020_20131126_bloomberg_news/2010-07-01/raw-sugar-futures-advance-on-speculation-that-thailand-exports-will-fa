             Raw-sugar futures gained for the
second straight session as Thailand, the second-largest
exporter, said it plans to buy back the commodity from traders
to meet rising domestic demand.  
 Thailand plans to repurchase 100,000 metric tons of the
sweetener now designated for export,  Prasert Tapaneeyangkul ,
secretary-general of the  Office of the Cane and Sugar Board ,
said yesterday. The nation’s output may decline as much as 13
percent in the next crop year as delayed rain and subsequent
floods will likely damage cane crops, the board said last week.  
 “This kind of news stokes the bullish flames,” R.J.
O’Brien & Associates, a broker in New York, said today in a
report.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.22 cent, or 1.4
percent, to 16.28 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the most-active contract declined as much as 2.6
percent. Yesterday, the price surged 5.1 percent.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, refined-sugar futures for
October delivery declined 70 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $468.60 a
metric ton.
