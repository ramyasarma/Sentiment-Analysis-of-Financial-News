             Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said recent export figures have been lower than expected
and there is some concern that economic growth this year may be
below the Bank of Israel’s 3.7 percent forecast.  
 “Export performance is somewhat worse than what we had
forecast,” Fischer said today at a  Tel Aviv Stock Exchange 
investor conference in London. “There is concern that growth
may come in below 3.7 percent. We are not changing our forecast
because that’s a concern, it’s not yet an expectation.”  
 Fischer held the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged on June
28 for a third month as an expansion in exports eased and
economic growth slowed to 3.6 percent in the first quarter from
4.5 percent in the previous three months. Exports account for
almost 50 percent of Israel’s gross domestic product.  
 The Finance Ministry on June 6 lowered its growth forecast
for the year to 3.6 percent, citing the debt crisis in Europe,
Israel’s main export market along with the U.S. The Bank of
Israel’s state-of-the-economy  composite index  had its smallest
gains in more than a year in April and May, indicating a
“slower pace” of recovery, the central bank said on June 17.  
 Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 stock  index has slid by about 14
percent in the past three months. The decline was led by
Discount Investment Corp., a holding company with interests in
banking and telecommunications, which dropped by more than 40
percent.  
 Fischer has increased the key rate by a percentage point
since August to 1.5 percent as the economy recovered from the
impact of the worst global recession since the Great Depression.  
 The 10-year Mimshal Shiklit maturing in January 2020
increased 0.10 shekel to 105.80 at the close in Tel Aviv,
pushing the yield on the 5 percent notes down 1 basis point to
4.51 percent, the lowest since the bonds were issued. The shekel
was little changed at 3.8881 per dollar.
