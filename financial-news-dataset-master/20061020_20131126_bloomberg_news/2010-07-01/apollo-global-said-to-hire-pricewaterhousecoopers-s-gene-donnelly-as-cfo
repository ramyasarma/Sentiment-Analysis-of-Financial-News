             Apollo Global Management LLC , the
private-equity firm founded by  Leon Black , hired  Gene Donnelly 
as chief financial officer, according to a person briefed on the
move.  
 Donnelly, who starts in his new role today after 29 years
at New York-based consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
fills a vacancy left by the departure of  Kenneth Vecchione  in
January, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the hiring wasn’t announced.  Barry Giarraputo , the company’s
chief accounting officer, had been serving as interim CFO.  
 Charles Zehren , a spokesman for New York-based Apollo, and
 Steve Silber , a PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman, declined to
comment.  
 Apollo is filling the position as it seeks to move its
Class A shares, now held by private investors, to the New York
Stock Exchange and sell $50 million of stock to the public. The
firm, with $54 billion in assets at year-end, and rival KKR &
Co. are listing their shares in the U.S. after last year’s
stock-market rebound.  
 Apollo’s Class A shares were first sold privately in August
2007 at $24 apiece and trade on GSTrUE, a system run by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. that is open to institutions and wealthy
investors.  
 Black,  Joshua Harris  and  Marc Rowan  control AGM Management
LLC, which serves as Apollo’s manager, overseeing operations and
making major decisions. Class A shareholders will get limited
voting power and have no right to elect the manager, according
to a March registration of the planned initial public offering
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
