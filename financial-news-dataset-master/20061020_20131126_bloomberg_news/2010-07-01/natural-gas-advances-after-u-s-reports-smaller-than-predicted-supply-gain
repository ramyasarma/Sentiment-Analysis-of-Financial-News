             Natural gas futures rose the most in
four weeks after a government report showed a smaller-than-
forecast U.S. stockpiles increase, and as a heat wave predicted
for next week will boost demand from power plants.  
 Gas inventories rose 60 billion cubic feet to 2.684
trillion in the week ended June 25, the Energy Department
reported. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a gain of 65
billion. A deficit to year-earlier supplies widened to 1 percent
from 0.5 percent in the previous report. Gas had declined 11
percent in the past 11 days.  
 “You got pretty hot weather on the horizon and the market
is rethinking the selling that occurred in the past few days,”
said  Teri Viswanath , director of commodities research at Credit
Suisse Securities USA in Houston. “The market doesn’t want to
be short through the long holiday.”  
 Natural gas for August delivery rose 23.8 cents, or 5.2
percent, to $4.854 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest one-day gain since June 3.
Prices are up 28 percent from a year ago.  
 The inventory increase was also smaller than the five-year
average gain of 82 billion cubic feet. Stockpiles were 12
percent higher than the five-year average, narrower than 13.3
percent a week earlier. Storage was 27 billion cubic feet below
levels in the same week of 2009.  
 “The storage number is pushing gas higher,” said  Tom Orr ,
director of research at Weeden & Co., a brokerage in Greenwich,
Connecticut. “You had very hot, humid weather last week and it
increased gas consumption.”  
 Weather Outlook  
 Hotter-than-normal weather next week will increase demand
for gas-powered electricity for air conditioning.  
 A round of “very strong heat” is expected to move through
the U.S. Midwest and East next week, according to Commodity
Weather Group, a forecaster based in Bethesda, Maryland. About
22 percent of electricity is generated using natural gas,
according to the Energy Department.  
 New York will have a high of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (34
Celsius) on July 5, 12 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather.com. Boston will have a high of 90.  
 Gas dropped in earlier trading after government forecasters
downgraded Hurricane Alex to a tropical storm after it moved
from the Gulf of Mexico into northeastern Mexico.  
 At its height, Alex reached Category 2 storm status with
winds of 100 mph (161 kph), the earliest Atlantic hurricane
since 1995 and the first of the 2010 season, according to the
National Hurricane Center.  
 Gulf Production  
 The storm has halted 877 million cubic feet a day of gas
production in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a report today
from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement. That’s equal to about 14 percent of Gulf
production.  
 Six rigs and 69 platforms have been evacuated because of
the storm, and 342,000 barrels of daily oil output were shut-in,
according to the government.  
 The number of U.S. natural-gas rigs grew by five to 958
last week, according to Baker Hughes Inc. The count has ranged
from 949 to 973 since April 1. Horizontal rigs, which are mostly
used for drilling shale gas, rose six to 833. A new report will
be released tomorrow.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 1.31 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $4.5401 per
million Btu, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
270,260 as of 3:01 p.m., compared with a three-month average
total of 260,000. Volume was 221,638 yesterday. Open interest
was 767,568 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
844,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.
