             The euro stayed higher against the
dollar and the yen after the European Central Bank said it will
lend financial institutions 111.2 billion euros ($136.5 billion)
for six days.  
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2289 as of 10:37 a.m. in
London, and advanced 0.3 percent to 108.57 yen.  
 The Frankfurt-based ECB said 78 banks asked for the six-day
funds at the benchmark interest rate of 1 percent. Banks today
need to repay 442 billion euros in 12-month loans, the biggest
amount ever awarded by the ECB. Banks asked for less money than
some analysts predicted in a three-month offering yesterday.
