             Kuwait shares fell to the lowest in
16 months, leading Gulf markets lower, on concern the global
recovery will falter as China’s growth slowed and Moody’s
Investors Service signaled it may cut Spain’s credit rating.  
 The  Kuwait SE Price Index  retreated 1.7 percent to 6,431.7
at the close in Kuwait City, the lowest level since March 2009,
taking this week’s decline to 2.9 percent.  Gulf Cable and
Electrical Industries Co. , a maker of electrical equipment, led
the drop and  Agility  slumped 7.9 percent. Bahrain’s  gauge  lost
1.2 percent to 1,379.98, the lowest since at least July 2004,
when Bloomberg started tracking the index. Oil fell to the
lowest in two weeks.  
 Stocks from the Gulf “are taking cues from the global
economic outlook, which seems to be in somewhat of a flux,”
said  Saud Masud , a Dubai-based analyst at UBS AG.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  tumbled 1.3 percent as China’s
Shanghai Composite Index dropped for a seventh consecutive day.
China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to a lower-than-forecast
52.1 in June from 53.9 in May. A reading of above 50 signals
expansion. Spain’s Aaa credit ranking was placed on review for a
possible downgrade by Moody’s, helping send the  Stoxx Europe 600
Index  lower 1.6 percent.  
 Oil at 2-Week Low  
 Crude fell as much as 1.9 percent to $74.21 a barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its
lowest since June 14. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  
 The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  slid 0.4 percent. Gulf Cable
lost 3.6 percent, the most since March 7, to 1,620 fils.
Agility, the Middle East’s largest storage and logistics
company, slumped to 290 fils.  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  rose 0.6 percent, ending five
days of declines, to 1,469.98. Nakheel PJSC said yesterday it
began making payments to its biggest contractors as the Dubai
World-owned property company seeks new terms on $10.5 billion of
unpaid bills and loans.  
 “While Nakheel payments are a positive step, investors are
more concerned about the broader health of the property market,
and the potential for another round of liquidity crunch in six
to nine months time,” Masud said.  
 Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  gained 0.2 percent.  Dhofar
International Development and Investment Holding Co. ,  Financial
Services Co.,   Global Financial Investment ,  Gulf Investment
Services  Co. and National Aluminum Production joined the index
today. Dhofar, an investor in banks, ports and power stations in
Oman, rose 1 percent and Gulf Investment gained 3.1 percent.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  retreated 0.8 percent and Abu Dhabi’s
 gauge  decreased 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s market was closed
for the weekend.
