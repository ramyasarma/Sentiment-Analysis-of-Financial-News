             About 200 contractors at  Total SA ’s
Lindsey oil refinery in northeast England returned to work today
as one unit at the site remained closed after a fatal explosion
led to asbestos contamination.  
 A further 800 contractors from other companies will return
to work tomorrow, Bernard McAulay, a national officer for the
Unite union, said today by phone. A fire and explosion last week
left some areas of the 221,000 barrel-a-day refinery unsafe.  
 The fire occurred on June 29 in a crude distillation unit,
which processes crude oil into fuels such as diesel and
gasoline. Total has said it may be forced to limit supplies to
customers from the refinery, the fourth-largest in the U.K.  
 One processing unit, under construction at the time of the
fire, remains closed because of the asbestos contamination,
McAulay said. Contractors on the hydro-desulfurization plant 3
have been sent to other jobs for now, he said. This may delay
the start of the unit.
