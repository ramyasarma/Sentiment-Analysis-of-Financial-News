             ABB Ltd. said it won’t match
Emerson’s offer for Chloride Group, dropping out of a bidding
contest.  
 “While we still see considerable value in the combination
of ABB and Chloride and have a high regard for the Chloride
management team, we must take a disciplined approach when
assessing potential acquisitions,” Chief Executive Officer Joe
Hogan said in the statement.
