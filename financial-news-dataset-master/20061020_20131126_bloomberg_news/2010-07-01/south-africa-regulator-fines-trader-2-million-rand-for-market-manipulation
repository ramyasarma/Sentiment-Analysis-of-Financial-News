             South Africa’s  Financial Services
Board  fined a local trader 2 million rand ($258,000) for market
manipulation that affected the share prices of  Cape Empowerment
Trust Ltd.  and  Beige Holdings Ltd.   
 The FSB’s enforcement committee imposed the penalty on
Timotheus Pretorius for trades he conducted between Jan. 20 and
Feb. 10, 2009, while working as a derivatives trader and
director at Origin SA Ltd., the Pretoria-based regulator said in
an e-mailed statement today. Pretorius’s attorney, Rudi Krause,
said he was unaware of any decision made by the enforcement
committee against his client.  
 “It must be noted that Mr. Pretorius fully co-operated,
admitted to the dispute and agreed to pay the 2 million rand,”
 Gerhard van Deventer , the head of the FSB’s Directorate of
Market Abuse, said in an interview from Pretoria today.  
 The FSB has imposed 10 fines for market abuse worth a total
of 5.64 million rand since the start of 2009, according to the
regulator’s website.  
 Cape Empowerment Trust, which no longer trades on the JSE,
fell 20 percent to 40 cents between Jan. 20 and Feb. 10, 2009,
compared with a 4 percent gain in the  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share
Index . Beige shares rose as much as 9.1 percent and fell as much
as 8.3 percent in the period.
