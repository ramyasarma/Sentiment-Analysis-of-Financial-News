             Australian  stock  futures climbed as
the government reached an agreement with mining companies on a
new tax. Japanese futures were little changed.  
 Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.6 percent.
American depositary receipts of Melbourne-based BHP Billiton
Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company, gained 0.7 percent,
and those of Rio Tinto Group, the No. 3, advanced 1.5 percent.  
 The government of Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
said this morning it reached a deal to cut a proposed
“supertax” on iron ore and coal, ending a dispute that cost
her predecessor his job. That followed media reports that an
accord was pending.  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,190 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,175 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,200 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time.  
 ADRs of Nissan Motor Co., a Japanese carmaker that counts
North America as its biggest market, sank 0.8 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo after U.S. reports showed slowing
manufacturing and plunging home sales. Japan’s Topix index has
fallen for eight consecutive days.  
 “The market will likely test new lows,” said  Juichi Wako ,
a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Concerns are increasing that fundamentals may worsen when
financial supports from governments expire.”  
 U.S. Manufacturing, Housing  
 In New York yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
retreated 0.3 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 2.
Manufacturing grew in June at the slowest pace this year, with
the Institute for Supply Management’s gauge dropping to 56.2
last month from 59.7 in May. The median forecast of economists
surveyed was 59.  
 The number of contracts to purchase previously owned houses
plunged in May by 30 percent, more than twice as much as
forecast, after a homebuyer tax credit expired. The drop was the
biggest in records dating to 2001.  
 The Australian mineral resources tax will be 30 percent,
applying to iron ore and coal, while the levy on oil and gas
projects will be 40 percent, the government said. The previous
government had proposed a 40 percent tax on all resources.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has lost 7 percent in 2010,
compared with drops of 7.9 percent for the  S&P 500  and 6.5
percent for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and zinc dropped 2.8 percent yesterday in London. Crude
oil for August delivery declined 3.5 percent to $72.95 a barrel
in New York, the lowest settlement price since June 8.  
 The yen appreciated to 87.54 against the dollar today,
compared with 88.33 against the dollar at the close of stock
trading in Tokyo yesterday. A stronger yen reduces overseas
income at Japanese companies converted into their home currency.  
 The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping costs for commodities fell
for a 25th consecutive session yesterday in London, the longest
streak since August 2005.
