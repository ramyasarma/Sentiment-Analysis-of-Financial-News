             India’s benchmark stock index fell to
the lowest level in two weeks as investors sold riskier assets
amid concerns global economic growth may be waning and domestic
borrowing costs may be raised this month.  
 ICICI Bank Ltd. , the country’s second-biggest lender,
declined 2.4 percent. China’s manufacturing growth slowed,
fanning concern among investors that global expansion may cool.
A measure of India’s factory output remained at a level that
suggests demand remains strong, adding to inflationary pressures.
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the biggest copper and zinc
producer, followed metal prices lower.  
 “Global issues continue to stir negative sentiments,”
said  A.N. Sridhar , who manages the equivalent of $17.2 million
at Sahara Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. In India, it’s “tough
for the government to dictate policies that try to balance
growth and contain inflation.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 191.57, or 1.1 percent, to 17,509.33, the lowest since June
16. The gauge climbed 1 percent in the three months ended June,
completing its longest quarterly winning streak since at least
September 1979, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
1.2 percent to 5,251.40. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.8 percent
to 2,229.53.  
 Factory Output  
 ICICI Bank declined 2.4 percent to 841.85 rupees, the
lowest in two weeks. DLF Ltd., a real estate developer, fell 1.7
percent to 283.85 rupees. Reports today added to concerns a
Chinese slowdown coupled with austerity measures in Europe may
undermine the global economic recovery. In India, monetary
policy makers may raise interest rates to stem inflation before
or in a scheduled July 27 meeting, Central bank Deputy Governor
 K.C. Chakrabarty  said June 28.  
 A report today from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed the India’s Purchasing Managers’ Index held above 50, a
level that indicates a gain in factory production, for a 15th
month in June.  
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the largest copper and
zinc producer, retreated 3.4 percent to 164.1 rupees. Three-
month delivery copper lost as much as 1.9 percent on the London
Metal Exchange. Aluminum declined 1.5 percent.  
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer,
fell 1.1 percent to 142.95 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest
producer of the alloy, declined 2.2 percent to 475 rupees.  
 Overseas  funds  sold a net  1.76 billion rupees  ($37.9
million) of Indian equities on June 29, paring their investments
in the stocks this year to 310.8 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Nestle India Ltd.  (NEST IN) rose 2.2 percent to 2,942.9
rupees. The unit of the world’s biggest food company plans to
buy a local company to expand its business and will announce the
acquisition “sooner than later,” Chairman and Managing
Director  Antonio Helio Waszyk  said.  
 NHPC Ltd.  (NHPC IN) climbed 2.4 percent to 32.15 rupees.
India’s biggest hydroelectric power producer was raised to
“hold” from “reduce” by  Girish Nair , an analyst at BNP
Paribas, who said the stock’s underperformance prices in the
company’s execution delays. The analyst raised his share-price
estimate to 32 rupees from 29 rupees. NHPC has lost 11 percent
of its value from this year’s Jan. 6 peak.  
 Parabolic Drugs Ltd.  (PDL IN) lost 14 percent to 64.85
rupees. The maker of pharmaceutical ingredients commenced
trading today. The company raised 2 billion rupees selling 2.03
million shares to the public at 75 rupees a piece.
