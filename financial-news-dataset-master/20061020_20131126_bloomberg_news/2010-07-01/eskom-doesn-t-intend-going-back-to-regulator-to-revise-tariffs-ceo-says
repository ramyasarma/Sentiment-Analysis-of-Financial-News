             Eskom Holdings Ltd., a South African
state-owned utility that provides 95 percent of the country’s
electricity, doesn’t intend to ask the industry regulator to
revise power tariffs, Chief Executive Officer Brian Dames told
reporters in Johannesburg today.  
 Should all three labor unions representing the company’s
workers choose to go on strike, “there are no contingency plans
that can comprehensively limit the impact of security of
supply,” Dames said. The unions are demanding more than what
the National Energy Regulator of South Africa allowed, Dames
said.
