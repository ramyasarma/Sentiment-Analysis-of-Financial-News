             Amazon.com Inc. , the world’s largest
online retailer, introduced an updated version of its larger
Kindle digital book reader with sharper contrast and a price
more than $100 less than the previous model.  
 The Kindle DX will sell for $379, down from $489, and will
begin shipping July 7, Seattle-based Amazon.com said today in a
statement. The device has darker fonts, making it easier to read
text.  
 Amazon.com , which introduced the Kindle in 2007, faces
increased competition from  Apple Inc. ’s iPad -- a color tablet
computer that lets users browse the Web, watch video and read
digital books. Amazon is also adding features to set the Kindle
apart from other e-readers made by Sony Corp. and Barnes & Noble
Inc.  
 The DX, which has a 9.7-inch diagonal screen, is tailored
for students and professionals. University students involved in
device trials during the past school year to measure how well
they performed with e-textbooks, said the Kindle DX was a poor
substitute for physical books. Amazon.com said it’s using the
feedback to improve the digital reader.  
 The smaller Kindle, which is  Amazon.com ’s top-selling
product and is about the size of a paperback book, costs $189.
Both devices display books in black and white to mimic the look
of a printed page. The Kindle bookstore has more than 620,000 e-
books, which can also be read on a variety of smartphones and
personal computers.  
 Amazon.com rose $1.70 to $110.96 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The stock has dropped 18 percent
this year.
