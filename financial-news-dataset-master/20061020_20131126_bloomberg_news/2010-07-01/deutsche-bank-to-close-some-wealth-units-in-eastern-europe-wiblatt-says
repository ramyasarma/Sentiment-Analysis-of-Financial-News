             Deutsche Bank AG  plans to close 
wealth management offices in Budapest and Warsaw, 
Wirtschaftsblatt reported, citing  Bernhard Ramsauer , who heads 
the bank’s Austrian private wealth management unit.  
 Clients in those countries will be serviced out of Vienna
and Geneva, the newspaper said.  
 While he expects the unit to make a loss again this year,
Ramsauer aims for a return to profit in 2011, Vienna-based 
Wirtschaftsblatt reported. The unit, which at that time was 
called Sal. Oppenheim Oesterreich, made a profit of 1.5 million
euros in 2008, the paper said.
