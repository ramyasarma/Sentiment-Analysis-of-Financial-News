             Siemens AG , Europe’s largest
engineering company, will fall “noticeably” short of a target
to cut 2,000 jobs at its unprofitable German computer-services
unit SIS, according to a pamphlet from  employee representatives .  
 As far as possible, the cuts to the workforce should take
place through voluntary agreements, relocations within the
company and part-time contracts, Wolfgang Niclas, who heads the
IG Metall union’s office in Erlangen, said in an invitation for
workers to attend a protest on July 5.  
 Negotiations with union representatives are at an advanced
stage, said Siemens spokeswoman Ivonne Junghaenel. The company
has already “found solutions” for 1,400 positions, she said,
without giving further details.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  is looking to
separate SIS from the rest of Siemens as it focuses on
industrial automation, medical scanners as well as equipment for
transport and energy infrastructure. The company on March 18
announced plans to cut 4,200 jobs at SIS -- 2,000 in Germany
alone -- after postponing the so-called carve-out until October.  
 Unions are pushing for only voluntary staff reduction and
want SIS to remain within the Siemens group for at least 10
years, given the parent has forecast record profit for this
year. SIS, which may be sold or listed on a stock exchange,
employs about 35,000 people globally, and clients include the
British Broadcasting Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG.
