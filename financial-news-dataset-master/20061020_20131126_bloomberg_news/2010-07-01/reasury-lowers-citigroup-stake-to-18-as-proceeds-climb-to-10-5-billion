             The U.S. government’s sale of
 Citigroup Inc.  shares slowed last month as the bank’s share
price tumbled 5.1 percent amid a stock-market slump.  
 The government sold 1.1 billion shares from May 27 through
June 30, according to a  Treasury statement today . The sales,
which are being managed by Morgan Stanley, generated proceeds of
about $4.3 billion and reduced the government’s holdings in New
York-based Citigroup to 5.1 billion shares, or 18 percent of the
total outstanding.  
 There were  24 trading days  during the period, for an
average of about 45 million shares a day. During an initial sale
period that ran April 26 through May 26, the Treasury sold 1.5
billion shares, or about 65 million a day during a 23-day
period. Treasury spokesman  Andrew Williams  declined to confirm
the calculations, saying a more specific report on the sales
would be posted on the  department’s website  today or tomorrow.  
 “At the current pace they’re going to miss” a targeted
completion date of Dec. 14, said  Linus Wilson , a finance
professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “If they
miss that arbitrary deadline, a lot of investors who were
banking on the end of government ownership of Citigroup are
going to be disappointed, because they would have to wait a
little longer.”  
 Paper Profit  
 The government got its Citigroup stock last year after
agreeing to convert $25 billion of bailout funds into common
shares at a price of $3.25 each, for a total of 7.7 billion
shares and a 27 percent stake. The bank received a $45 billion
rescue in 2008 and repaid $20 billion in December.  
 With the sales to date, the Treasury has locked in a profit
of about $2 billion, and has a paper profit of about $2.5
billion on the remaining shares. The Treasury and Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. also retain $5.3 billion of Citigroup’s
junior debt, which they got to keep after the bank agreed in
December to forgo a government asset-guarantee program.  
 “We are pleased that Treasury has profitably sold a third
of its common shares in Citi, adding to the substantial return
for taxpayers realized last year,” the bank said in a statement
today.  
 ‘Blackout Period’  
 The Treasury, which said on Dec. 14, 2009, that it would
liquidate its Citigroup stake within 12 months, suspended the
sales after yesterday’s trading session to comply with a
“blackout period” in advance of the bank’s second-quarter
earnings report, scheduled for July 16. The selling will resume
after that, Treasury said.  
 Wilson, the finance professor, estimated that Treasury has
about 95 trading days remaining before the self-imposed
deadline. That estimate assumes sales resume right after  this
month’s earnings report , and pause again in October ahead of the
bank’s third-quarter earnings, he said.  
 The $4.3 billion in proceeds from the government’s latest
sale represents an average realized price of about $3.91 a
share. That compares with  $6.2 billion of proceeds , or about
$4.13 a share, during the initial period.  
 The Treasury’s average realized price over the two periods
was $4.03, according to today’s statement.  
 ‘Value at Risk’  
 “I cringe at the thought that we made a lot of money, when
we still have a lot of value at risk,” Wilson said. “There are
a lot of scenarios where the stock could dip below $3.25” in
the next 95 trading days, he said.  
 Citigroup, which traded at $4.61 on April 26 when the first
sale period was announced, has tumbled during the past two
months as the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell by 13 percent.
The shares rose 1 cent to $3.77 as of 1:42 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 The Treasury’s sales have averaged 6 percent to 7 percent
of the daily volume in Citigroup shares, Wilson said. An average
of about 640 million shares traded during the most-recent
period, down 35 percent from the initial period, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 “I suspect the slower pace is not due to the lower share
price but to the lower volumes,” Wilson said. “It’s easier to
hide their trades in a bigger volume. It’s easier not to drive
down the price if the volume is higher.”
