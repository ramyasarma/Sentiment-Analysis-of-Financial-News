             Aquila Resources Ltd. , partner in the
Australian Premium Iron joint venture with American Metals &
Coal International Inc., is interested in increasing its stake
in their A$4.1 billion ($3.4 billion) iron ore project.  
 “We have 50 percent of the project,”  Tony Poli , chief
executive officer of the Perth-based company, said today in a
phone interview. “Given the right opportunity, we’d be keen to
increase our stake in the project.”  
 The venture’s West Pilbara project includes an iron ore
mine, port and rail project in Western Australia’s mineral-rich
Pilbara region. South Korea’s Posco, Asia’s third-biggest
steelmaker, is sending representatives to look at the project
next week, the Australian Financial Review reported today.  
 “Clearly if AMCI is taking Posco to site, that’s where
they are focusing their efforts,” Poli said. UBS AG was hired
by AMCI last year to sell part or all of its stake, he said.  
 Aquila  fell 3.3 percent to A$7.60 on the Australian stock
exchange at 11:44 a.m. Sydney time, giving the company a market
value of A$2.46 billion. Baosteel Group Corp. owns a 15 percent
stake in Aquila.  
 The West Pilbara project is expected to produce 25 million
metric tons when fully operational, according to  Aquila’s
website . The company expects government approvals by the end of
next year and construction to start in 2012.  
 Aquila isn’t in talks to increase its stake, Poli said.
