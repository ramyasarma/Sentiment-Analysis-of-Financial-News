             Poland’s manufacturing grew the most
in almost three years, which may convince the central bank to
overlook slowing inflation and increase rates, according to Bank
Zachodni WBK.  
 The PMI rose to 53.3, the highest since August 2007, from
52.2 in May, HSBC Holdings Plc said today in an e-mailed
statement summarizing a survey by Markit. The reading was higher
than the median estimate of 52.3 in a Bloomberg survey of seven
economists. Inflation in June slowed to 2.1 percent from 2.2
percent in Mat, according to the Finance Ministry’s estimate.  
 The central bank yesterday left its  key interest rate  at a
record-low 3.5 percent for a 12th month and for the first time
indicated borrowing costs may rise. Economic growth may
accelerate to as much as 3.9 percent this year, from 1.8 percent
in 2009, according to the central bank. Faster growth may
increase inflationary pressure, economists said.  
 “Upward pressure on prices persists and even though June
inflation declined, according to the ministry’s forecast, we
still claim that in a few months the Monetary Policy Council
will start the interest rate hike cycle,” said  Maciej Reluga ,
chief economist at Bank Zachodni WBK.  
 The weakened to 4.1476 per euro by 1:19 p.m. in Warsaw from
4.1328 late yesterday.  
 Inflation Outlook  
 Poland’s PMI has remained above 50.0, a threshold
indicating overall improvement in business conditions, for the
past eight months. The gauge is a composite derived from five
indexes. The faster growth of new orders pushed the figure up in
June, HSBC said.  
 The central bank yesterday also increased its estimate for
2011 economic growth to between 3.3 percent and 5.9 percent from
1.8 percent to 4 percent. Factors boosting inflationary pressure
outpaced those helping to reduce it, Narodowy Bank Polski
Governor  Marek Belka , said yesterday in Warsaw.  
 The annual inflation rate is likely to drop below 2 percent
in July and August and bounce back as of September, hovering
between 2 percent and 2.5 percent through December, said Antoni
Dudek, deputy head of the Finance Ministry’s statistics
department, quoted by PAP news service.
