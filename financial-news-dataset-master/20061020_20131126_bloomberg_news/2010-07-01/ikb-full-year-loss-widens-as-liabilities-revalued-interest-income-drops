             IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG , the
first German lender bailed out during the subprime crisis, said
its full-year loss widened as it revalued liabilities and net
interest income declined.  
 The net loss was 974 million euros ($1.2 billion) in the
year ended March 31, compared with a loss of 580 million euros a
year earlier, the Dusseldorf-based bank said in statement
distributed by the DGAP newswire today.  
 IKB became Germany’s first casualty of the U.S. subprime-
mortgage crisis in 2007 after investments in asset-backed
securities soured, requiring a government-led bailout. The bank
also received guarantees of as much as 12 billion euros from the
Soffin rescue fund after Lone Star Funds, a Dallas-based
private-equity firm, bought a majority stake in 2008.  
 “IKB’s business performance may continue to be impaired by
the financial and economic crisis and may be subject to strong
earnings volatility depending on its intensity and duration,”
the bank said in the statement.  
 Net interest income slumped 41 percent to 179 million euros
because of higher refinancing costs and a reduced asset volume.
The company booked a loss of 859 million euros related to the
measurement of liabilities, the bank said.  
 IKB said it has sufficient liquidity until the first
quarter of 2012 because of guarantees provided by Soffin. While
the bank will require “significantly less” funding in the
coming years, some of the funds guaranteed by Soffin must be
replaced from 2012, it said.
