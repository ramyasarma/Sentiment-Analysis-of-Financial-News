             American International Group Inc. ,
the insurer selling assets to repay a U.S. rescue, may seek
buyers for its Japanese life units as Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Benmosche  reshapes the firm.  
 The  Congressional Oversight Panel  and analysts including
 Suneet Kamath  of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. have said AIG’s Star
Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. may attract
interest. The two sales could yield $5 billion, Kamath said last
month. Benmosche, hired out of retirement last year, agreed to
sell one overseas unit, American Life Insurance Co., known as
Alico, and plans to divest another, AIA Group Ltd.  
 “AIG needs to raise money, it needs to define its core
competencies going forward and Star and Edison are saleable
properties,” said  Clark Troy , an analyst for research firm Aite
Group. “It didn’t make sense to sell Alico and sell AIA and
keep the Japanese units.”  
 AIG is scaling back as some rivals are seeking to expand.
 Prudential Financial Inc. , the second-biggest U.S. life insurer,
and Canada’s  Sun Life Financial Inc.  are adding clients and
considering acquisitions with the capital accumulated since the
financial crisis. MetLife Inc., the No. 1 U.S. life insurer,
agreed in March to pay $15.5 billion for Alico.  
 AIG is considering selling the two Japanese units for about
$5 billion, the  Wall Street Journal  reported yesterday, citing
people it didn’t identify.  
 “Pru is the only thing that makes sense” among potential
U.S. acquirers of Star and Edison, said  Steven Schwartz , an
analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc. “If you think
about it, Met’s a little busy. You’ve got Pru that has
significant life-insurance operations in Japan.”  
 Prudential a ‘Buyer’  
 Prudential Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld  has said
the Newark, New Jersey-based firm is a “buyer.” The company
may add to businesses outside the U.S., according to its annual
report. Prudential acquired bankrupt Yamato Life Insurance Co.
last year adding to operations in Japan, where the company has
done business for more than two decades.  
 “It’s a market we know very well,” Strangfeld said on
June 9. “We have confidence in our management there.”  Bob DeFillippo , a Prudential spokesman, declined to comment.  
 AIA operates in faster-growing economies including China
while Alico gets most of its revenue in Japan. A deal to sell
AIA to London-based Prudential Plc for $35.5 billion faltered
this year, and the Treasury Department said AIG may dispose of
the unit through a public offering. The sale was to help AIG
repay the U.S. government for the $182.3 billion bailout.
