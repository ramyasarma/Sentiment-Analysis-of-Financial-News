             Japan’s  Topix  index fell for an
eighth consecutive day, its longest losing streak in almost a
year, after Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut Spain’s
credit rating and China’s manufacturing growth slowed.  
 Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, sank 3.3
percent as the dollar and euro weakened against the yen. Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co., which counts China as its  biggest
market , lost 2.6 percent. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s
third-largest shipping line, retreated 2.5 percent after cargo
rates fell for a 24th day. Softbank Corp. plunged after Japan’s
No. 3 mobile-phone company said an affiliate must pay more taxes.  
 “Anxiety is prevailing in the market,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist in Tokyo at Toyota Asset Management
Co., which oversees about $15 billion. “The consensus view that
we’ll be able to avoid a double dip is going to be reversed
because of mounting concerns about the future of the economy.”  
 The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 2 percent to 9,191.60 at
the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The broader  Topix  lost 1.6
percent to 828.39, with five stocks retreating for each that
rose. All but 1 of the Topix’s 33 industry groups declined. Both
gauges closed at the lowest levels since Nov. 27.  
 The Topix has slumped 17 percent from its 52-week high on
April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and China’s steps to
curb property prices will hurt global growth. This year the
Japanese index has dropped 8.7 percent, cutting the average
price of its stocks to 16.1 times  estimated earnings , the lowest
level since November 2008.  
 Nikkei Leads Declines  
 The Nikkei 225 fell the most among equity benchmarks in the
Asia-Pacific region, even as Japan’s quarterly Tankan survey of
sentiment at the largest manufacturers rose to a two-year high.
The Nikkei 225 has fallen 19 percent from its 52-week high on
April 5, approaching the 20 percent threshold that some analysts
consider as signaling the beginning of a bear market.  
 “There’s a discrepancy between market moves and
fundamentals,” Hamasaki said. “People can’t easily believe the
fact that fundamentals are improving because they are worried.”  
 Honda and  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s largest automaker,
and Canon Inc., the world’s biggest maker of cameras, were the
heaviest drags on the Topix. Honda declined 3.3 percent to 2,512
yen and Toyota lost 2.3 percent to 3,010 yen. Canon fell 3.2
percent to 3,225 yen.  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 107.50 per euro today
from 108.15 at yesterday’s close of stock trading in Tokyo.
Against the dollar, it strengthened to 88.08 from 88.55. The
stronger yen reduces income when overseas revenue is converted
into local currency.  
 China Manufacturing Slows  
 Hitachi Construction Machinery fell 2.6 percent to 1,613
yen, and  Komatsu Ltd. , which is the world’s second-biggest maker
of earthmoving machinery and counts China as its fastest-growing
market, retreated 1.7 percent to 1,591 yen.  
 China’s manufacturing expanded at a slower pace for a
second month in June, the country’s Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today, adding to signs that growth in the
world’s third-largest economy is moderating.  
 In New York yesterday, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
decreased 1 percent to its lowest level since October after the
Moody’s report, snuffing out an earlier rally. Gains were
limited after a private report based on payrolls showed that
companies in the U.S. added fewer workers in June than forecast.  
 Spain’s top credit ranking was placed on review for a
possible downgrade by Moody’s as the country prepares to sell as
much 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of five-year notes today.
Moody’s analysts yesterday said “deteriorating” growth
prospects and challenges in meeting fiscal targets mean Spain’s
Aaa classification may be lowered by as much as two grades.  
 ‘Wall of Worry’  
 “A downgrade of Spanish sovereign debt would be another
piece of negative news that adds to demand for perceived safe-
haven investments,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage about
$1.1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Investors
are already finding difficulty traversing the wall of worry.”  
 Nippon Sheet Glass Co. fell 2.3 percent to 215 yen. Olympus
Corp., a maker of optical instruments, sank 2.7 percent to 2,063
yen, the lowest close since July 14.  Sony Corp. , the maker of
Bravia televisions and Cyber-shot cameras, dropped 3.7 percent
to 2,296 yen. All three companies get more than 20 percent of
their sales in Europe. Sony also said it’s recalling 535,000
Vaio personal computers because they may overheat due to a
temperature-control defect.  
 Shipping lines  declined after the Baltic Dry Index of cargo
rates for commodities fell for a 24th consecutive session
yesterday in London. Kawasaki Kisen lost 2.5 percent to 357 yen.
Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s biggest shipping line by sales,
dropped 1.8 percent to 321 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the No.
2, lost 2.5 percent to 579 yen.  
 Commodity Shares Drop  
 The industry groups that include metal and oil companies
retreated. Copper for October delivery fell as much as 1.1
percent in Shanghai. Crude oil for August delivery fell 0.4
percent to $75.63 a barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest
settlement since June 14. It dropped 1 percent today.  
 Mitsubishi Materials Corp., Japan’s third-largest copper
producer, tumbled 5 percent to 227 yen, the biggest drop since
June 2009.  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. , a rival, slumped 2.1
percent to 1,097 yen. Inpex Corp., Japan’s largest oil-
exploration company, lost 2.3 percent to 485,500 yen, a level
not seen since November 2008. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co.
sank 2.3 percent to 3,570 yen.  
 Softbank fell 4.4 percent to 2,267 yen, the  largest
contributor  to the Nikkei’s decline. The company said last
quarter’s net income will be reduced after affiliate  Yahoo Japan
Corp.  was ordered to pay more tax by the Tokyo Regional Taxation
Bureau. Yahoo slumped 3.2 percent to 34,500 yen.
