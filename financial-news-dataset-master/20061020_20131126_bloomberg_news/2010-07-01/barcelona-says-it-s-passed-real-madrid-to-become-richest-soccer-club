             Barcelona said it became the world’s
richest soccer club by sales after earning 445.5 million euros
($547.5 million) for the 12 months through June 30.  
 The Spanish champion made the announcement on its Web site
late yesterday. Real Madrid, the richest club since 2005, hasn’t
disclosed its income for the same 12-month period although it
had budgeted for sales of 445.2 million euros.
