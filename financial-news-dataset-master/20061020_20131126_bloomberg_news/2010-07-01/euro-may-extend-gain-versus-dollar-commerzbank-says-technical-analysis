             The euro may advance against the U.S.
dollar should it remain above a key support level, Commerzbank
AG said, citing technical indicators.  
 “Euro-dollar is holding and attempting to rebound off key
short-term support at $1.2145, which is the May 19 low,”  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and currency technical
analysis at Commerzbank in London, wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “While above here near-term stability is maintained and
our stance is neutral to positive. We look for the
$1.2445/$1.2490 inter-year pivot to be retested. Should this be
surpassed, there is scope for the rally to extend.”  
 A break above $1.2490 may lead to the euro climbing toward
$1.2587, the 55-day moving average, Commerzbank said.  
 The euro gained 0.8 percent to $1.2333 as of 1 p.m. in
London.  
 A support level is an area on a chart where buy orders are
clustered. The stronger the support, the more selling is needed
to drop below that level.
