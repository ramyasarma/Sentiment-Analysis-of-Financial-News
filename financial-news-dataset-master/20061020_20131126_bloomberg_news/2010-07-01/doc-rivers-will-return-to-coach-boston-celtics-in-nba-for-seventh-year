             Doc Rivers  will go for a second
National Basketball Association title in seven years as coach of
the Boston Celtics next season.  
 “Doc is re-energized and enthusiastic about coming back to
make another run at winning a championship with the Celtics,”
 Danny Ainge , the president of basketball operations, said in a
two-sentence statement on Boston’s website last night.  
 The Celtics hired Rivers in April 2004, five months after
he was fired by the Orlando Magic, where he spent 4 1/2 years
and earned NBA Coach of the Year honors in 2000. Rivers guided
the Magic to the playoffs three times before securing a record-
extending 17th NBA title for Boston in 2008. The Celtics lost
the NBA Finals this month to the Los Angeles Lakers, who won a
16th title with an 83-79 Game 7 win.  
 Rivers, 48, may find himself presiding over a team in
transition next season.  Paul Pierce  will opt out of the final
year of his contract and become a free agent, the Boston Globe
reported, while  Ray Allen  is also due to become a free agent
today.  Kevin Garnett  is under contract for two more seasons.  
 Rivers has rebuilt the Celtics before with success. In the
2006-07 season, Boston finished with a 24-58 record, the second-
worst in the NBA. Rivers added Allen in June 2007 and Garnett
the following month and the Celtics won the NBA title the
following season with a league-best 66-16 mark.  
 Rivers is 280-212 with a 41-30 postseason record at the
Celtics and has a career coaching record of 451-380, with a 46-
40 mark in the playoffs.
