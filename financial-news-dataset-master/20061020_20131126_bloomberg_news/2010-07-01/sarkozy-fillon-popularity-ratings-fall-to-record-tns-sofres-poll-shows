             French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s approval ratings fell to a
record low as they face voters’ defiance over pensions changes
and a series of scandals involving government ministers, the  TNS
Sofres  institute said in a survey.  
 Sarkozy’s popularity fell 2 percentage points from June to
26 percent, according to the poll released today in Le Figaro
Magazine. Seventy-one percent of respondents said they disagreed
with his policies, according to TNS Sofres.  
 Fillon’s approval rating also dropped 2 percentage points,
to 35 percent, the Paris-based institute said.  
 TNS Sofres telephoned 1,000 people aged 18 or older between
June 25 and 28 for the survey. It didn’t give a margin of error.
