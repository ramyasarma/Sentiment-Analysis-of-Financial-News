             Brazil’s industrial  production  rose
less than forecast in May and at the slowest annual rate since
November.  
 Output climbed 14.8 percent in May from the same month a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today in Rio
de Janeiro, trailing economists’ forecasts for an increase of
17.8 percent, according to the median estimate of 33 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Production was unchanged in May from
April, surprising economists who forecast 1.5 percent growth.  
 Industrial production has been increasing at an
unsustainable rate, climbing at least 14 percent every month
since November, said  Diego Donadio , an economist at BNP Paribas
in Sao Paulo. Today’s slowdown won’t be enough to persuade
central bank policy makers to hold off on increases to the
benchmark lending rate, he said.  
 “Figures show a significant deceleration, but output is
still growing above its potential,” Donadio said. “The central
bank will have to raise the Selic to 12.25 percent by year end
to contain inflation expectations for 2011.”  
 Policy makers will raise the benchmark interest rate by 75
basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, in each of the next two
meetings and by 50 basis points in October before pausing,
Donadio said.  
 The yield on interest rate futures contracts due January
2011, the most traded on the Sao Paulo BM&F futures exchange
today, fell two basis points to 11.34 percent at 9:00 a.m. New
York time. The real, which has slid 3 percent against the U.S.
dollar this year, gained 0.3 percent to 1.7998 per dollar.  
 Capital Output  
 Production of capital goods rose 1.2 percent in May from
April, while consumer goods production fell 0.5 percent.  
 “The output of capital goods rising more than production
is a healthy mix for policy makers because it favors a more
contained inflation outlook,” Donadio said.  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark interest rate to
11 percent at its July 20-21 meeting, as 2010 growth
expectations increased for a 15th straight week, according to
the median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100
economists published June 28.  
 Policy makers have increased Brazil’s  benchmark  Selic rate
twice this year to 10.25 percent, from a record low 8.75 percent
in March, to prevent Latin America’s biggest economy from
overheating.  
 Gross domestic product rose 9 percent in the first quarter
of 2010 from the same quarter a year earlier, faster than any
other major Latin American economy.  
 The government’s benchmark IPCA price index rose 5.22
percent in May from a year earlier. Annual price increases have
exceeded the government’s 4.5 percent target every month this
year and are forecast to remain above that level at least
through 2011, according to the central bank survey.
