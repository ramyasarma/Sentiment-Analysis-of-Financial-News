             Google Inc. said its Web search
features in China are “fully or mostly accessible.”  
 The owner of the Internet search engine provided the access
information on its website on mainland China service
availability.  
 Google, at odds with Chinese rules that require filtered
search results, in March began automatically directing users to
a site in Hong Kong, where there are no such controls. China
said the remedy was unacceptable and may not renew Google’s
license to provide Internet services. To allay the government’s
concerns, Google began directing users this week to a page with
a link to the Hong Kong site.
