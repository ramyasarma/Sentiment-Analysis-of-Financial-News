             Mexican companies  are likely to
underperform those in  Brazil  due to higher valuations and weaker
economic growth in the second half of 2010, Credit Suisse Group
AG said.  
 Mexican stocks are  valued  at 15.8 times trailing earnings,
while the  MSCI Emerging Market Index  is valued at 14.3 and
Brazil’s  Bovespa  index is at 12.9, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “Mexico continues to be expensive in comparison to Brazil
and other global emerging markets,” Credit Suisse analysts,
headed by  Emerson Leite  in Sao Paulo, wrote in an e-mailed
report dated yesterday. Credit Suisse sees “slower growth in
the second half of 2010.”  
 Gross domestic product growth at Latin America’s second-
largest economy will probably slow to 3.95 percent in the third
quarter from 5.75 percent in the previous three months,
according to the Bloomberg median forecast of six economists.  
 Mexico’s IPC stock index has dropped 3.7 percent this year,
while the Bovespa retreated 12 percent in 2010.
