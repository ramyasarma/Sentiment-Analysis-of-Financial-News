             Kleinwort Benson , the U.K. private
bank that traces its roots to 1786, plans to hire bankers in the
next 12 to 24 months as it expands its funds management and
financial advisory units.  
 The decision follows the completion today of Kleinwort
Benson’s sale to Brussels-based  RHJ International SA , the
publicly traded investment company started by  Timothy Collins ,
founder of private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC.  
 “We want to grow in all of these areas,” said  Robert Taylor , 50, Kleinwort Benson’s chief executive officer said in
an interview in London today. “We definitely want to hire,
particularly in the front-end of relationship management, asset
management and the advisory side.”  
 RHJ bought Kleinwort Benson from  Commerzbank AG  for 225
million pounds ($334 million) in October as it seeks growth in
financial services and to decrease its reliance on the
automotive-components industry. London-based Kleinwort Benson,
which also has offices in the Channel Islands, will have more
than 10 billion euros ($12.3 billion) of assets under management
after RHJ also decided to buy  KBC Groep NV ’s funds business in
Ireland last month.  
 The bank has not yet decided how many bankers to hire as
it’s reviewing its business plan, Taylor said. In September
2008, Commerzbank announced it was cutting more than 1,000 jobs
at Dresdner Kleinwort in London after buying the firm’s Dresdner
Bank AG parent. In February 2009, Dresdner Kleinwort said it
would cut as many as 150 jobs from its equity research and cash
equities units.  
 ‘Ambitious Plans’  
 The firm may end up competing with companies including NM
Rothschild & Sons Ltd. and Lazard Ltd., Taylor said, adding that
“we have ambitious plans.” The bank may expand into some non-
European emerging markets in the next three years to five years,
he said.  
 The Kleinwort transaction marks RHJ Chief Executive Officer
 Leonhard Fischer ’s return to Kleinwort Benson. He led the
company for 2 ½ years while it was owned by Dresdner Bank and
then quit in 2002 over what Dresdner called “differences of
opinion” about how to run the company. Kleinwort said in a
statement today that Fischer will become chairman of Kleinwort
Benson Private Bank Ltd.  
 “We are looking to expand our business prudently but
aggressively,” Taylor said. “We’d like to see what’s in the
marketplace,” he said, referring to potential acquisitions.
