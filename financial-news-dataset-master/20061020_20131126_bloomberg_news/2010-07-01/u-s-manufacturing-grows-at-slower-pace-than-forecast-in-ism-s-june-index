             Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded in
June at a slowest pace this year as factories received fewer
orders and demand from abroad cooled.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing  gauge 
fell to 56.2 last month from 59.7 in May. A reading greater than
50 points to expansion, and the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News was 59. A measure of new orders
dropped to the lowest level since October.  
 Manufacturing is easing into a more sustainable pace of
growth after leading the economy out of the worst recession
since the 1930s. With production having already picked up,
companies are facing less pressure to replenish inventories at
the same time China’s economy slows and Europe is saddled with a
debt crisis.  
 “There’s less catching up for the factory sector than
earlier this year and the softness we’re seeing in the economy a
little more broadly is resulting in diminished sales,” said
 Richard DeKaser , chief economist at Woodley Park Research in
Washington.  
 Stocks fell and Treasury securities rose after the report.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 1.4 percent to 1,016.84
at 10:37 a.m. in New York. The 10-year Treasury note gained,
pushing down the yield to 2.89 percent from 2.93 percent last
yesterday.  
 China and Europe  
 Other figures today showed slower manufacturing growth in
China and Europe. China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to
52.1 in June from 53.9 the previous month. A gauge of factory
output in the 16-member euro region declined to 55.6 last month
from 55.8.  
 The economic recovery in the U.S. is being accompanied by a
labor market that’s taking time to improve and a struggling
housing market. First-time filings for  jobless benefits  rose
13,000 last week to 472,000, Labor Department figures showed
earlier today.  
 The number of contracts to purchase previously owned homes
plunged a record  30 percent  in May after a homebuyer tax credit
expired, the National Association of Realtors said today in
Washington.  
 Economists forecast the U.S. manufacturing gauge would fall
to 59, according to the  median  of 81 projections in the
Bloomberg survey. Estimates ranged from 55.9 to 61.2.  
 Production, Orders  
 The ISM’s production index decreased to 61.4 from 66.6. The
new orders measure dropped to 58.5 from 65.7.  
 The  employment  gauge decreased to 57.8 from 59.8. The
measure of export orders declined to 56 from 62.  
 Federal Reserve policy makers last month said the labor
market was “improving gradually.” Central bankers also
reiterated a pledge to keep the benchmark interest at a record
low for an “extended period” to help spur the economic
recovery.  
 Factories have  added 126,000 workers  during the first five
months of this year, matching the most successive gains since
2006, according to the Labor Department. Manufacturers added
another 25,000 employees in June, economists said before
tomorrow’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department.  
 The measure of orders waiting to be filled dropped to 57
from 59.5. The index of prices paid decreased to 57, the lowest
since November, from 77.5.  
 Inventory Index  
 The inventory index rose to 45.8 from 45.6 in May. A figure
lower than 50 means manufacturers are reducing stockpiles.  
 Some manufacturers in the U.S. are upbeat. 3M Co., the
maker of 55,000 products from Post-it Notes to Scotch tape, this
week projected second-quarter sales that topped analysts’
estimates as demand recovers.  
 Sales will be $6.6 billion to $6.75 billion, the St. Paul,
Minnesota-based company said in a June 28 statement. Analysts
predicted $6.56 billion, the average of eight estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Total-dollar sales are projected to rise 4 percent
to 6 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010.  
 Caterpillar Inc. , the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, will see revenue rise 25 percent this year on surging
demand for equipment from the mining and energy industries in
developing nations, Chief Executive Officer  James Owens  said
last month.  
 “We’re coming back very strongly after the recession,”
Owens told reporters after a conference in Lima. “We’ll see
growth in oil, gas and coal because we need energy for these
rapid-growth emerging countries that are driving the need for
commodities.”
