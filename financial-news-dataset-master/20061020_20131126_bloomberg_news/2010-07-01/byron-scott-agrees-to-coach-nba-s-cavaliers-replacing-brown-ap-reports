             Byron Scott , who led the New Jersey
Nets to consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals in 2002-03,
has agreed to become coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, the
Associated Press reports.  
 The Cavaliers and Scott are finishing details of the
contract, Scott’s agent, Brian McInerney, told AP. Cavaliers
spokesman Tad Carper said in an e-mail that the team can’t
confirm the report. Scott, 49, would replace  Mike Brown , who was
fired in May after the team’s second-round loss in the National
Basketball Association playoffs.  
 The hiring could make Scott the next coach for LeBron
James, who won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player award the past two
seasons while leading the Cavaliers to a 127-37 record. James
became a free agent today and is scheduled to have meetings with
teams such as the New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, Miami Heat,
Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Clippers.  
 Scott has a  352-355  record, coaching the Nets in 2001-04
and the New Orleans Hornets in 2004-10. He was voted the NBA’s
coach of the year after leading the Hornets to a 56-26 record
during the 2007-08 season. Scott won three NBA titles as a
player over 14 seasons, including 11 with the Los Angeles
Lakers.
