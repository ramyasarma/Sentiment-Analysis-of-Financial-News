             Wheat rose to a seven-week high as
speculative investors bet demand will increase because U.S.
production of corn, a competing grain used to feed livestock,
may not be as big as expected.  
 Farmers sowed 87.872 million acres (35.6 million hectares)
with corn, less than forecast in March, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Corn rose 8.6 percent yesterday,
fueling expectations that feedlot managers will use more wheat
to fatten cattle. Speculative investors who were  net-short 
48,883 wheat contracts as of June 22 may be buying futures and
liquidating bets that prices would fall.  
 “The wheat had built up quite a bit of shorts, and there’s
a sense that if the corn market rallies, that’ll run the wheat
market up,” said  Jason Britt , the president of Central States
Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri. “The report caught
traders leaning to the short side.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 19.5 cents, or
4.1 percent, to $4.9975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price earlier rose to $5.04, the highest price since May 12.
Futures are up 9.4 percent in the past two sessions, the biggest
such gain since Aug. 3.  
 The price also rose as  the dollar  lost as much as 1.9
percent against a basket of six major currencies. Wheat gained
3.5 percent in the second quarter on expectations that adverse
weather will curb world output.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
