             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,
the nation’s largest oil refiner, will reduce processing
volumes at its Guangzhou plant by 2 percent this month
compared with June, industry website  Oilchem.net  reported.  
 The plant plans to process 1 million metric tons of oil
in July, or about 235,000 barrels a day, the Shanghai-based
industry website said, citing an official at the refinery
that it didn’t identify. It didn’t elaborate on the reason
for the cut.  
 The Guangzhou refinery won’t shut any major refining
units in the second half and will maintain monthly oil
processing volume at around 1 million tons, it said.  
 The refinery in Guangdong province, China’s biggest
manufacturing hub, has an annual capacity of 15 million tons.  
 Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, will almost double
oil refining capacity at its Jiujiang plant to 10 million tons a
year, Oilchem reported separately, without saying where it got
the information. The plant, in Jiangxi province, plans to
process 410,000 tons of crude oil this month, little changed
from June, it said.
