             Sweden’s central bank will not need
to raise it key repo rate as much as was previously assumed, the
Riksbank said in a statement on its website today.  
 “The weaker development of the economies of the euro area
means that the repo rate in the longer term is not expected to
be raised as rapidly as was previously assumed,” the bank said.  
 The Riksbank today raised the main lending rate a quarter-
point to 0.5 percent from a record low of 0.25 percent.
