             U.K.  government bonds  rose, pushing
the 10-year yield to the lowest level in 14 months, as signs
that the global economic recovery may be stalling reduced demand
for riskier assets.  
 Gilts also rose as Spain’s top credit ranking was yesterday
placed on review for a possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors
Service. The pound climbed to the highest level versus the
dollar since May 5 after data showed factory growth and jobless
claims in the U.S. were worse than economists forecast.  
 “Recent data from major economies raised questions about
the strength of the global economic recovery,” said  Audrey Childe-Freeman , a senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman
Ltd. in London. “It’s all about risk-off trades at the moment.
People are nervous and they are more comfortable with safety.”  
 The 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points to 3.32
percent as of 5:24 p.m. in London, after earlier slipping to
3.31 percent the lowest level since April 2009. The 4.75 percent
security maturing in March 2020 rose 0.37, or 3.7 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 111.72. Two-year note yields fell
one basis point to 0.76 percent.  
 The pound rose 1 percent to $1.5102 after climbing to
$1.5167, rebounding from losses earlier today. It fell 0.6
percent against the euro to 82.39 pence, after earlier dropping
as much as 0.9 percent.  
 The currency’s recovery today was driven partly by
investors unwinding positions in which they used sterling to
fund investments in higher-yielding currencies such as the
Australian dollar or the South African rand, according to  Hans- Guenter Redeker , head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
London.  
 ‘Negative for Pound’  
 “In a longer-term, a slowdown in the global economy should
be negative for the pound given the country is relying more on
foreign demand,” Redeker said. “But in the near-term, some
people are unwinding carry trades in which they used the pound
as a funding currency. That perhaps explained the pound’s move
today.”  
 Data has showed manufacturing growth from China to the
euro-region slowed in June, suggesting the global export-led
recovery might be running out of steam.  
 A gauge based on a survey of U.K. companies by Markit
Economics and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply
fell to 57.5 in June from 58. The  Institute for Supply
Management’s  U.S. manufacturing gauge declined more than
economists forecast to 56.2 from 59.7 in May.  
 Jobless Claims  
 Initial jobless claims in the U.S. climbed to 472,000 in
the week ended June 26 from a revised 459,000 in the previous
week, the Labor Department reported today. The median forecast
of 46 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decrease
to 455,000 from a previously reported 457,000.  
 U.K. bonds have returned 3 percent since the May 6
election, compared with 1.4 percent from German bonds over that
time, according to indexes from Bank of America Corp’s Merrill
Lynch unit. The election brought to power Prime Minister David
Cameron who pledged deep spending cuts, saying the U.K. may face
the same fate as Greece should it not lower its deficit.  
 Standard Life Investments’  Philip Laing  beat other bond
investors in the first half by switching money into U.K. debt
just before a recovery prompted by the new government’s bid to
lower the deficit and avoid a downgrade.  
 His $14 billion SLTM U.K. Government Bond Fund gained 5.5
percent this year after he moved money from euro-region debt
into gilts. That made it the best performer among 20 government
bond funds based in Europe with more than $1 billion to invest,  
 “The U.K. is in the process of being rerated” by bond
investors, Laing said. “Last year the U.K. was a laggard. We
got the benefit from not being in the U.K. when it was being
pushed down, and turning that around when the country was being
reassessed.”
