             ThyssenKrupp AG , Cementir Holding SpA
and Nuova Terni Industrie Chimiche SpA lost a court challenge of
a European Union decision to classify 80 million euros ($97.6
million) in Italian state aid as illegal.  
 “The court observes that measures which mitigate the
burdens normally included in the budget of an undertaking such
as the supply of goods or services on preferential terms
constitute benefits,” the EU’s General Court, the second-
highest in the bloc, ruled today in Luxembourg.  
 The three companies and the Italian government appealed a
2007 decision by the European Commission that the Italian
subsidies, granted as a preferential electricity tariff since
2005, were illegal and must be returned. The aid was granted to
compensate for the 1962 expropriation of a hydroelectric plant,
said the commission, which checks whether subsidies in the 27-
nation EU hinder competition, said.  
 “The preferential tariff granted to Terni can be traced
back to the nationalization of the electricity sector in
Italy,” the court said today.  
 The cases are T-62/08, ThyssenKrupp Acciai Speciali Terni v
Commission; T-63/08, Cementir Italia v Commission; T-64/08,
Nuova Terni Industrie Chimiche v Commission; T-53/08, Italy v
Commission.
