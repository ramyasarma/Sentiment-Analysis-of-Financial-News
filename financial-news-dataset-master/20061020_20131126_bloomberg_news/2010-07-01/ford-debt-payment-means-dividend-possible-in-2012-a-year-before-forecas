             Ford Motor Co. , which caught up
yesterday on preferred stock dividends it missed for 14 months,
may resume payouts on the common stock as soon as 2012,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The automaker still needs to pay off more of its
approximately $27 billion in  debt  before resuming the  dividend ,
officials and analysts said. Still, quarterly dividends of 5
cents a share could proceed in 2012, a year ahead of earlier
projections, according to Bloomberg estimates based on the data.  
 Ford removed a key legal hurdle to the dividend by paying
$255 million in deferred dividends on its Capital Trust II
preferred stock, along with a $3.8 billion payment to a trust
for union retirees. Now that those dividends are paid in full
and restored, Ford is free to reinstate a dividend on its common
shares and Class B shares owned by the Ford family. The size of
the payments -- made ahead of schedule -- shows the carmaker is
confident it can generate  cash .  
 “If you have that kind of cash flow and you’re paying down
debt, I could see a dividend maybe a year from now,”  Bernie McGinn , president of McGinn Investment Management in Alexandria,
Virginia. His firm owns 330,000 Ford common shares.  
 Ford eliminated its common-stock dividend on Sept. 15,
2006, when it was 5 cents a share. The company made its last
payout on the Capital Trust II in January 2009 and missed
payments starting in April of that year.  
 “Our priority is to continue to reduce debt and strengthen
our balance sheet, and ultimately restore an investment-grade
 debt rating ,”  Mark Truby , a Ford spokesman, said in an e-mail.
“As we make progress on these objectives, I’m sure our board
will evaluate the stock dividend down the road.”  
 Ford Debt  
 Ford borrowed $23 billion in late 2006 after it hired Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  from Boeing Co. The funds gave
the automaker a cash cushion that helped it withstand losses and
avoid the bankruptcies that befell General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Group LLC last year.  
 The preferred stock dividend and union payments reduced
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford’s  debt  by about $4 billion. Ford
common shares rose 20 cents to $10.08, reversing five  trading 
days of declines. Ford generated free cash flow of $4.68 billion
in 2009 and $1.02 billion in the first quarter of this year.  
 The Bloomberg dividend estimates are based on seven
criteria, including a company’s  guidance , dividend history,
regression analysis and put-call parity.  
 Chief Financial Officer  Lewis Booth  said in a March
interview that the company is unlikely to bring back a common-
stock dividend anytime soon.  
 ‘Huge Demands’  
 “We still have huge demands on our cash,” Booth said at
the time. “I wouldn’t want to raise people’s expectations.”  
 The chances that Ford pays a dividend in the near future
could be further diminished by the slower-than-expected recovery
in auto sales, said  Shelly Lombard , senior high-yield analyst
with New York-based Gimme Credit.  
 “If the recovery stalls, you like a company to have more
cash,” Lombard said in an interview. “The industry is still
volatile. I don’t think they’re at a point where they should be
paying a common-stock dividend.”
