             German stocks fell to a five-week low
as manufacturing growth slowed in China and the U.S. and more
Americans unexpectedly applied for jobless benefits last week.  
 HeidelbergCement AG  sank 5 percent as construction shares
fell.  Daimler AG  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  lost more than
3 percent.  ThyssenKrupp AG  lost 2.6 percent as metal prices
declined.  Deutsche Bank AG  fell 3.6 percent.  
 The benchmark DAX Index lost 1.8 percent to 5,857.43 in
Frankfurt. The gauge is down 7.5 percent from its April 26 high
on concern the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe will spread. The
broader HDAX Index fell 1.9 percent today.  
 “Due to continuing uncertainties regarding the outlook for
economic growth and corporate profits, we still expect a
difficult environment for equity markets over the next few
months,” UniCredit Research wrote in its quarterly note on the
German equity market. “As we expected, the economic cycle is
moving from a tailwind to a headwind for German equities.”  
 China’s manufacturing growth slowed more than economists
forecast in June, adding to signs that the world’s fastest-
growing major economy is cooling.  
 The government’s Purchasing Managers’ Index declined for a
second month, falling to 52.1 from 53.9 in May. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was 53.2.  
 U.S. Economy  
 In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of
manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier.  
 Initial jobless claims increased by 13,000 to 472,000 in
the week ended June 26, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The number of people receiving unemployment
insurance rose, while those getting emergency benefits dropped
after Congress failed to act on extending the legislation.  
 HeidelbergCement, the world’s third-largest cement
manufacturer, dropped 5 percent to 37.23 euros as construction
shares declined across Europe.  
 Daimler, the world’s second-biggest luxury carmaker, fell
3.6 percent to 40.42 euros. BMW, the largest maker of luxury
cars, declined 4.7 percent to 38.2 euros.  Volkswagen AG ,
Europe’s biggest automaker, slid 3.3 percent to 69.97 euros.  
 ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, lost 2.6
percent to 19.82 euros. Copper, aluminum and zinc dropped after
the Chinese manufacturing data signaled demand growth may be
weakening in the world’s largest consumer of metals.  Salzgitter
AG , the country’s second-biggest steelmaker, retreated 3.4
percent to 47.32 euros.  
 ECB Lending  
 Deutsche Bank lost 3.6 percent to 45 euros. The European
Central Bank said it will lend banks 111.2 billion euros for six
days to help them cope with the expiry of its landmark 12-month
loan today.  
 The Frankfurt-based ECB said 78 banks asked for the six-day
funds at the benchmark interest rate of 1 percent. Earlier
today, Nomura International Plc reiterated its “reduce” rating
on Germany’s biggest bank.  
 IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG  sank 7.4 percent to 60.1 euro
cents as the lender said its full-year net loss widened to 974
million euros from 580 million euros.  
 Aixtron AG  advanced 2.7 percent to 20.26 euros as the maker
of equipment used to produce LED screens announced a multiple
tool order from Sanan OptoElectronics Co. Ltd.
