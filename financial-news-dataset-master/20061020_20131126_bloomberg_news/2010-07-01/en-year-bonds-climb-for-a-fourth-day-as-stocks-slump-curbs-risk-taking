             India’s  10-year bonds  advanced for a
fourth day on speculation investors will favor the relative
safety of debt as signs a global economic recovery is losing
steam drag stocks lower.  
 Yields fell to their lowest level in three weeks after the
food inflation rate slowed to an eight-month low. The  Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index  fell 1.1 percent and the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index sank 1 percent after HSBC Holdings Plc
Purchasing Managers’ Index reports showed manufacturing growth
slowed last month in China, India, South Korea and Taiwan.  
 “Investors seem to prefer the safety of bonds as the
global economy is still faltering,” said  Roy Paul , deputy
general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped
three basis points to 7.52 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price rose 0.23, or 23 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to
101.93.  
 Inflation as measured by the increases in wholesale prices
of farm products slowed to 12.92 percent in the week ended June
19 from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said. India’s
Purchasing Managers’ Index declined to 57.3 from 59 in May,
according to HSBC and Markit Economics.  
 The 10-year bonds were also buoyed by optimism the
government will succeed in bringing the  budget deficit  down from
a 16-year high after revenue from selling telecommunications
licenses exceeded official estimates.  
 Record Borrowing  
 The deficit in the first two months of the fiscal year that
began April reached 26.5 percent of the annual target, data
published by the government yesterday showed. The  finance
ministry  aims to cut the deficit to 5.5 percent of gross
domestic product in the fiscal year through March, from 6.9
percent in the preceding 12-month period.  
 The companies that won permits for third-generation mobile
phone operations paid 677.2 billion rupees ($14.5 billion) in
May, almost double the 350 billion rupees estimated in the
budget. Wireless broadband operators paid a combined 385.4
billion rupees last month.  
 India has no plan to change the overall borrowing plan for
the first six months of the fiscal year, a finance ministry
official said today.  
 The government this week trimmed scheduled bond sales by 30
billion rupees to ease a cash shortage. The central bank will
sell 100 billion rupees of bonds maturing in seven, 12 and 30
years tomorrow.  
 India proposes to complete 63 percent of its full-year
borrowing target of 4.57 trillion rupees in the first half.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased for a third day. The rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, was 5.39 percent, compared with 5.47
percent yesterday.
