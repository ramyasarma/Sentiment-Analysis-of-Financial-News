             An investigation into allegations
that former Vice President  Al Gore  groped a masseuse has been
reopened, the police in Portland, Oregon, said in a statement.  
 The statement didn’t say why the police decided to look
anew at the alleged 2006 incident, which they initially declined
to pursue for lack of evidence.  
 “The Portland Police Bureau has made the decision to re-
open the case regarding the allegations brought forward against
Al Gore,” the department said in a statement posted on its
 website  yesterday. “Consistent with our policy regarding open
investigations, the Police Bureau will not be commenting on any
additional specifics regarding the case at this time.”  
 The masseuse told police that Gore made unwanted advances
during an appointment on Oct. 24, 2006, at a hotel in Portland,
where Gore was delivering a speech on climate change, the
Associated Press reported.  
 A spokeswoman for Gore says that he “unequivocally and
emphatically” denies the allegations, the AP said.
