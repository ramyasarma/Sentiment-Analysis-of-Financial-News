             News Corp. ’s international unit will
start charging tomorrow for online access to The Times and The
Sunday Times newspapers based in London, the first steps in the
media company’s bid to get readers to pay for news on the Web.  
 Internet sites for both newspapers will be available for
1 pound ($1.50) a day or 2 pounds a week, News International
said in a statement today. Customers who register for long-term
use of the sites can pay a promotional price of 1 pound for the
first 30 days, while subscribers to the newspapers’ print
editions will automatically receive online access, it said.  
 The Times and The Sunday Times are the first of four  News
International  titles in the U.K. to move to an online-pay model.
They are among the first general-interest English-language
newspapers to charge for web access as publishers search for new
ways to earn revenue and curb free sharing of their news on
Internet search engines and aggregator sites. The New York Times
plans to erect an Internet paywall next year.
