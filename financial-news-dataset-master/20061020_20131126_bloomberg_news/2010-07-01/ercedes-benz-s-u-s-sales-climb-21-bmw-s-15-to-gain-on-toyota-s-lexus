             The top three luxury auto brands
boosted U.S. sales in June as high-end car companies and dealers
added Ann Taylor shoppers to their Gucci-loving loyalists.  
 Sales of  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks rose 21
percent to 18,269 in June, while  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s
namesake brand boosted U.S. deliveries 15 percent to 19,182, the
automakers said yesterday. The German brands narrowed the gap
against  Toyota Motor Corp. ’s Lexus, which increased sales 2.7
percent to 17,332 cars and light trucks.  
 Luxury automobiles will continue to rebound if they can
lure customers battered by the recession who are just starting
to consider high-end cars, said  Pam Danziger , president of Unity
Marketing, which tracks luxury trends.  
 “Many people are looking at themselves and saying, ‘We’re
really middle class, not upper class,’” Danziger said.
“They’re realizing you can buy very acceptable fashion from Ann
Taylor, you don’t need to go buy Gucci. It’s the same with
cars.”  
 Lexus remains the group leader at the mid-year point with
107,430 sales. Mercedes sold 103,674 through six months and BMW
delivered 100,632. All three have boosted sales this year,
reversing last year’s trend. In 2009, U.S. sales fell 17 percent
for Lexus, 15 percent for Mercedes and 21 percent for BMW.  
 Luxury brands can attract people who are recovering their
wealth by focusing on entry-level models, Danziger said.  
 “They’re looking for real value, not the nameplate,” she
said.  
 ‘Room to Grow’  
 Lexus, Mercedes, BMW and other luxury brands are pulling
those people in with incentives on leases, said  Jesse Toprak , an
auto-industry analyst at Truecar.com.  
 “Last year was so miserable for luxury brands, there’s a
lot of room to grow,” Toprak said. “Those people hurt by what
happened are starting to come back.”  
 As a result, the luxury sector will outpace overall U.S.
sales for the rest of the year, Toprak said  
 Mercedes grew on E-Class sedan sales, which rose 75 percent
from a year earlier to 4,865. Mercedes’ entry-level luxury
sedan, the C-Class, had the most sales for the month at 5,563,
up 21 percent.  
 BMW’s increase came on sales of its redesigned 5-Series
sedan and the X5 sport utility vehicle, which both rose more
than 40 percent.  
 Shares of BMW  rose  35.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 38.56
euros as of 12:48 p.m. in Frankfurt. Daimler  added  65 cents, ro
1.6 percent, to 41.07 euros.  
 U.S. Brands  
 A 6.6 percent decline in passenger car sales stunted
Lexus’s growth. Sales of the IS sedan fell 17 percent to 2,863
in June, while the ES sedan’s sales dropped 14 percent to 3,366.  
 U.S. luxury brands were mixed.  
 General Motors Co.’s Cadillac sales rose 39 percent to
11,788 in June as its SRX sport utility vehicle jumped almost
sixfold to 3,804. Cadillac has sold 64,785 cars and trucks this
year.  
 Lincoln,  Ford Motor Co. ’s luxury unit, fell 11 percent to
6,318. Sales of the Town Car, MKS and MKX all declined by at
least 21 percent.  
 Domestic luxury brands’ sales growth will stay slow because
years of uncompetitive products have left them with an “image
problem,” Toprak said.  
 “Most luxury buyers buy on image,” he said. “That’s the
biggest hurdle for Lincoln and Cadillac to overcome. It’s going
to be a 5- to 10-year process, but that process has started.”  
 German Brands  
 Volkswagen AG’s  Audi division sold 8,601 cars in June, up
14 percent from a year earlier. The company’s 48,440 sales in
the first six months of 2010 are a record, the company said in a
statement.  
 Porsche SE said U.S. sales more than doubled in June after
a new version of the Cayenne sport-utility vehicle and the
Panamera Gran Turismo car hit showrooms. Deliveries increased
137 percent to 2,141 cars and SUVs last month from a year
earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer said in a
statement.  
 Acura,  Honda Motor Co. ’s luxury brand, said sales rose 31
percent in June to 10,839. The MDX sport utility vehicle spurred
Toyko-based Honda’s increase with 3,847 sales, 64 percent more
than last June.  
 Sales of  Nissan Motor Co. ’s Infiniti climbed to 8,304 in
June, 32 percent higher than a year earlier.
