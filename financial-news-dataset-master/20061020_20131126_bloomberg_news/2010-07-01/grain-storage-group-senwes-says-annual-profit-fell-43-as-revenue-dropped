             Senwes Ltd., the company that
controls more than a quarter of South Africa’s grain-storage
facilities, said full-year profit dropped 43 percent as sales
declined.  
 Net income fell to 209 million rand ($27.2 million) in the
12 months through April, from 367 million rand a year earlier,
the Klerksdorp-based company said in a statement in the Business
Day newspaper today. Revenue declined 19 percent to 9.04 billion
rand, it said.  
 Senwes said in May its board had decided “in principle”
to list on the stock exchange in Johannesburg.
