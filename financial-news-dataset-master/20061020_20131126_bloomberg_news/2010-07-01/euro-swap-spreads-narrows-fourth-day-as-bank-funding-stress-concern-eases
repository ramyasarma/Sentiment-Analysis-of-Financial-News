             Two-year euro swap spreads narrowed
for a fourth day as signs funding pressures are easing at
Europe’s financial institutions diminished the need for hedges
against a deterioration in credit quality.  
 The spread, which indicates the extra risk of trading with
banks for two years instead of buying government securities,
touched the lowest level in more than five weeks as the European
Central Bank awarded temporary loans to ease the expiration of
12-month emergency funds. European banks yesterday asked for
131.9 billion ($164.7 billion) in three-month loans, less than
economists expected. The euro rallied to the highest in a month
against the dollar.  
 “There’s a growing perception that the ECB may be moving
toward shorter maturities and the state of the European banking
system may not be as dire as we thought,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New
York. “The euro is becoming a bit detached from the risk
jitters.”  
 Two-year euro swap spreads were 1.7 basis points lower at
74.93 at 3:35 p.m. in New York after falling as low as 72.17
basis points, the lowest level since May 21. The five-year swap
spread was little changed at 61 basis points and the 10-year
spread was 31.44 basis points.
