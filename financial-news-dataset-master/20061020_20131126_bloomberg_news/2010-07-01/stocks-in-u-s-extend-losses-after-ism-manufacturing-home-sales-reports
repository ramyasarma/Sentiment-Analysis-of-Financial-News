             U.S. stocks extended losses as data
on manufacturing and home sales trailed economists’ estimates,
fueling concern that the economic recovery is in peril.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.8 percent to
1,022.73 at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average decreased 78.29 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,695.73.  
 The number of contracts to purchase previously owned houses
plunged in May by 30 percent,  more than twice as
much as forecast, after a homebuyer tax credit expired. The
Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of manufacturing slipped
more than estimated to 56.2.  
 U.S. equity index futures slid before the open of U.S.
exchanges after the Labor Department said initial jobless claims
increased by 13,000 to 472,000 in the week ended June 26,
defying the median economist forecast for a decline to 455,000.
The number of people receiving unemployment insurance rose,
while those getting emergency benefits dropped after Congress
failed to act on extending the legislation.  
 The S&P 500 has tumbled 15 percent from this year’s high on
April 23 on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
China’s moves to tame inflation will dent global growth. The
gauge is 7.6 percent lower this year and has fallen for seven of
the past eight days, trimming its valuation to about 15 times
the reported earnings of its companies, near the cheapest level
in a year, according to Bloomberg data.  
 China’s manufacturing growth slowed more than economists
forecast in June, adding to signs that the world’s fastest-
growing major economy is cooling. The government’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index fell to 52.1 in June from 53.9 in May. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was
53.2. An HSBC Holdings Plc manufacturing index slid to a 14-
month low.
