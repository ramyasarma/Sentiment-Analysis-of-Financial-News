             The Swiss franc strengthened to a
record against the euro as investors sought a haven from euro-
region fiscal concerns, and a report showed Swiss manufacturing
expanded for a 10th month.  
 Switzerland’s currency strengthened for the sixth-straight
day against the euro and the eighth day versus the dollar.
European stocks fell, with the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropping
1.4 percent. The  SVME purchasing managers’ index  slipped to 65.7
in June from 66.4 the previous month, Zurich-based Credit Suisse
Group AG said. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 “The euro against safe havens like the Swiss franc has
become highly correlated to risk appetite,” said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in London.
“The franc looks grossly overvalued at these levels.”  
 The franc was little changed at 1.3184 per euro at 12:14
p.m. in London, after earlier reaching 1.3074, the strongest
since the euro’s debut in 1999. It gained 0.7 percent to 1.0695
per dollar after hitting 1.0677, the strongest since April 22.  
 The Swiss National Bank, which has been buying foreign
currencies since March 2009 to counter the threat of deflation,
said on June 17 the risk has “largely disappeared.” It also
held the three-month Libor target rate at 0.25 percent while
saying it can’t keep interest rates at a record low in the
medium term without fueling inflation.  
 The franc has risen 5.4 percent against the euro since the
central bank changed its stance.
