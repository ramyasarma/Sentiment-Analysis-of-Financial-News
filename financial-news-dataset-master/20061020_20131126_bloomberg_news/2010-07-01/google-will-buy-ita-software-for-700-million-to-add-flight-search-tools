             Google Inc.  agreed to buy flight-
information provider ITA Software Inc. for $700 million to get a
bigger slice of the online travel business and make it easier
for users to find trip information on the Web.  
 The acquisition will help Google build flight-search tools,
the companies said today in a joint statement. The all-cash deal
is subject to adjustments, they said, without elaborating.  
 “Search is even more important today than ever,” Google
Chief Executive Officer  Eric Schmidt  said today on a conference
call discussing the transaction. “In looking at travel, and
airline travel in particular, I think you can see that airline
travel and search are a perfect opportunity for more innovation,
more investment, more interesting products.”  
 ITA may help Google vie with travel-information services
from rivals including  Microsoft Corp . and Kayak.com. Each wants
more of the online travel market, which in the U.S. generated
$88.4 billion in sales last year, according to PhoCusWright
Inc., a consulting firm in Sherman, Connecticut.  
 Google had more than five times the  online search share  of
Microsoft’s Bing in the U.S. in May, according to ComScore Inc.
in Reston, Virginia. Microsoft has lured users partly through
travel-related tools including features that predict ticket-
price changes.  
 ITA , based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provides software
for online travel company  Orbitz Worldwide Inc.  and for
Microsoft. Schmidt said Google will honor all existing
agreements.  
 ‘Significant Review’  
 With the agreement, Google’s flight-search tools may help
users more easily search for flights and compare flight options
and prices, Schmidt said. Then, Google would push users to sites
to buy tickets.  
 “It’s a smart move,”  Henry Harteveldt , an analyst at
Forrester Research Inc. in San Francisco, said of the
acquisition. “You are dealing with a product that has very low
loyalty or preference among travelers. It’s led by scheduling
and the price of the airline ticket.”  
 Google completed its $750 million acquisition of AdMob
Inc., a provider of mobile ads, after the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission cleared the deal in May. The deal was first disclosed
by Google in November.  
 Schmidt said he suspects there will be a “significant
review” of the ITA deal. He declined to speculate on the timing
of when the acquisition will close.  
 Google , based in Mountain View, California, fell $5.46 to
$439.49 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have fallen 29 percent this year.
