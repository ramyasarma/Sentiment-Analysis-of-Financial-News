             The book value of  WestLB AG’s  real-
estate financing unit, Westdeutsche ImmobilienBank AG, has been
reduced below 600 million euros ($734 million),  Handelsblatt 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  
 There is much uncertainty about how much the unit can be
sold for, current price estimates ranging from 450 million to
700 million euros, the newspaper said.  
 Aareal Bank AG  and financial investors Apollo Global
Management LLC and Terra Firm are potential buyers, according to
Handelsblatt.
