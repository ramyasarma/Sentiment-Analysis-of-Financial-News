             Two labor unions representing the 
majority of Eskom Holdings Ltd.’s workers issued strike notices
yesterday, preparing the way for strike beginning next week, 
Business Day reported.  
 The National Union of Mineworkers and the National Union of
Metalworkers of South Africa issued the notices to strike, the 
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing the unions. The 
strike may threaten power supplies in South Africa during the 
last week of the World Cup soccer tournament, it said.
