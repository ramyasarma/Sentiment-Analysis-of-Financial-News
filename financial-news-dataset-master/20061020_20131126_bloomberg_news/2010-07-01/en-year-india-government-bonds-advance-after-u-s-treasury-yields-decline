             India’s 10-year bonds gained for a
fourth day as benchmark fixed-income yields in the U.S. headed
for the biggest weekly decline in more than a month, adding to
speculation borrowing costs will remain low globally.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due 2020 dropped three
basis points to 7.52 percent as of 9:10 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price gained
0.20, or 20 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 101.90.
