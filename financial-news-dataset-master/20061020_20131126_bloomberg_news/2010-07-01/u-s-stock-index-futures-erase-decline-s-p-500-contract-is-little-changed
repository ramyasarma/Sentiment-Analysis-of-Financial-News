             U.S. stock-index futures were little
changed, erasing earlier declines triggered by an unexpected
jump in jobless claims and signs that global manufacturing
growth is slowing.  
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
lost less than 0.1 percent to 1,025.7 at 9:03 a.m. in New York
after reversing a 1 percent slump. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures rose 2 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 9,718 after
slumping as much as 71 points earlier.
