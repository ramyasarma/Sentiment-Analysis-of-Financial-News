             Ukraine’s economy will expand 3.5
percent this year, boosted by exports, the World Bank said today
in a report on the former Soviet republic.  
 Gross domestic product will grow 4 percent next year and 5
percent the following year, the bank said at a press conference
today in Kiev.  
 World Bank economist Ruslan Piontkivskyi also said at the
press conference that Ukraine urgently needs to contain the
state budget deficit because the government has
“overestimated” revenue, including what it brings in from
value-added taxes. The budget gap will remain above 8 percent of
GDP this year, he said  
 The bank also forecast the inflation rate at the end of
this year to be 11.9 percent, while the rate next year will be
9.5 percent. It will fall to 8.1 percent in 2012.
