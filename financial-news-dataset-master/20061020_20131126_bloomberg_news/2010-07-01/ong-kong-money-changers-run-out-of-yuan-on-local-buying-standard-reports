             Hong Kong money changers have run out
of yuan as residents buy up the currency on the hope that it
will appreciate, the Standard reported today, citing an
unidentified local bank manager.  
 The shortage may also be caused by money changers hoarding
the currency, the Chinese-language an identified official at the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority was quoted by the Hong Kong-based
Chinese-language newspaper as saying.
