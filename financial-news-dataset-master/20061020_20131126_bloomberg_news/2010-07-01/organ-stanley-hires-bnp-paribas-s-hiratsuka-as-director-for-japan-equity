             Morgan Stanley said it hired  Motomi Hiratsuka  from  BNP Paribas FP  as an executive director for its
equity business in Japan.  
 Hiratsuka, 44, joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., a
joint venture with  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , this
week, said  Mika Watanabe , a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the
venture, without commenting further. Hiratsuka was formerly a
sales director in global equity and commodity derivatives at BNP
Paribas in Tokyo.  
 New York-based Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ started
two joint ventures in May for investment banking and trading.
Teaming up with Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested $9 billion in the
Wall Street firm in 2008, may help Morgan Stanley bolster its
ranking in underwriting securities and advising on Japanese
mergers.  
 Hiratsuka joined Daiwa Securities Group Inc.’s brokerage
unit in 1989 after graduating from  Tokyo University of Science .
He joined BNP Paribas in 2002 after working at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in Tokyo.
