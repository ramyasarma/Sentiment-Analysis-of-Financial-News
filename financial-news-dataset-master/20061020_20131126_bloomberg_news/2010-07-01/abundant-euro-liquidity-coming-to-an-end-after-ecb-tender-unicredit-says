             An abundance of excess money-market
liquidity in the euro area may start to dry up after demand for
loans in a three-month European Central Bank offering yesterday
was “much lower than expected,” UniCredit SpA said.  
 “It looks like the days of abundant liquidity are coming
to an end,” a team headed by  Michael Rottman  in Munich wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “Yesterday’s auction is an
encouraging signal and suggests liquidity tensions are less
strong than was anticipated.”  
 The results of today’s six-day tender from the ECB will
provide a more “complete picture,” the analysts wrote in the
note.
