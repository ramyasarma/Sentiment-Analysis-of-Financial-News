             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell as a report showed  industrial production 
in Latin America’s largest economy rose less than forecast in
May, easing speculation the central bank will need to boost
borrowing  costs .  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 11.32 percent at 9:19 a.m. New York time.  
 “The central bank might not be as hawkish as expected, as
aggressive at raising rates, and what we’re seeing is slower
growth and lower inflation expectations being priced in,” said
 Bertrand Delgado , a senior economist at Roubini Global Economics
LLC in New York.  
 Output climbed 14.8 percent in May from the same month a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today in Rio
de Janeiro, trailing economists’ forecasts for an increase of
17.8 percent, according to the median estimate of 33 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.7992 per dollar,
from 1.8047 yesterday. The gain follows a 0.9 percent increase
in June.
