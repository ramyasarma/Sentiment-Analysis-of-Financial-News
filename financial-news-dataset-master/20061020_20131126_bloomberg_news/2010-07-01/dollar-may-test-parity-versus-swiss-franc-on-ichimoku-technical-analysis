             The dollar may drop to parity with
the Swiss franc based on ichimoku analysis of trading patterns,
Ueda Harlow Ltd. said.  
 The greenback’s ichimoku chart is showing a number of
bearish signals as its short-term conversion line is below the
longer-term baseline, and it is trading below the bottom of the
so-called cloud, said  Toshiya Yamauchi , a senior analyst at the
online currency-trading company. The dollar is poised to extend
its declines to parity after having failed to protect its 200-
day moving average of around 1.06 francs, he said.  
 “The break of the 200-day moving average line will
encourage not only short-term players but also longer-term
investors to buy the franc,” Tokyo-based Yamauchi said.  
 The dollar traded at 1.0617 francs as of 8:22 a.m. in
Tokyo, having fallen from this year’s high of 1.1731 on June 1.  
 The greenback’s conversion line stood at 1.0858 and the
baseline was at 1.1155. The 200-day moving average was 1.0619.
The dollar fell to as low as 1.0578 yesterday.  
 Ichimoku analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist, is
used to predict a currency’s direction through analyzing the
midpoints of historical highs and lows. The conversion line
plots the sum of the highest high and lowest low over the last
nine trading days. The baseline is the same calculation over
the past 26 days.  
 Fibonacci Retracement  
 “Given the failure to protect the key level at the 200-
day moving average, its declines may gain momentum to reach
initially a 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement from this year’s
high and eventually parity,” Yamauchi said, referring to one
of the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.  
 The 76.4 percent retracement of the dollar’s rally from
this year’s low of 1.0131 francs on Jan. 11 to the 2010 high of
1.1731 on June 1 is at 1.0509, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The dollar was last at parity with the franc Dec. 4.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Key percentages include 23.6, 38.2, 50 and 61.8. A break above
resistance, where sell orders may be clustered, or below
support, where there may be buy orders, indicates a currency
may move to the next level.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
