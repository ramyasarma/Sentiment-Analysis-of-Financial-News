             Toyota Motor Corp ., the world’s
biggest carmaker, may move production of some cars to Thailand
from Japan, the head of its  Thai unit  said.  
 “We are starting consulting with Toyota Motor Japan, but
things are not finalized yet,” Kyoichi Tanada, president of
Toyota Motor Thailand Co., said in an interview in Bangkok. He
declined to elaborate on the models being considered and said
Toyota may take as long as two years to make a final decision.  
 Automakers including  Nissan Motor Co.  and  Ford Motor Co. 
are moving production to Thailand as costs rise in other
manufacturing regions. Nissan, Japan’s third-largest automaker,
plans to produce 90,000 March compact cars in the Southeast
Asian nation this year, the company said yesterday. Ford plans
to build a $450 million car factory in the nation by 2012 that
will build cars for export as well as for domestic sale.  
 Toyota, the largest automaker in Thailand, currently
assembles its one-ton Hilux Vigo pickup truck and Fortuner
sport-utility vehicle in the country for export. Lower costs and
a strong supplier base are among Thailand’s advantages, Tanada
said.  
 The Toyota City, Japan-based carmaker has raised its sales
forecast for Thailand to 270,000 vehicles this year from an
earlier estimate of 250,000, as the nation’s economy recovers,
Tanada said.
