             Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. , South
Africa’s second-largest food retailer, agreed to sell its
Australian unit, Franklins, to Metcash Trading Ltd. for A$215
million ($180 million).  
 Pick n Pay’s board concluded earlier that the Franklins
business “had not yet achieved critical mass,” and Cape Town-
based Pick n Pay decided to find an investment partner or a
buyer for the unit, it said in a statement today. Metcash has
its headquarters in Sydney.  
 Pick n Pay bought  Franklins  in 2001. At the company’s
annual general meeting on June 21, Chairman  Gareth Ackerman 
said: “It is clear that we should have concentrated more on the
larger and more promising African market,” rather than enter
the competitive Australian market.  
 Pick n Pay and Metcash will complete their transaction by
the end of September, the statement said. The deal awaits
clearance from Australia’s antitrust regulators. Pick n Pay said
it will use money from the sale for “various strategic business
enhancement initiatives in southern Africa.”
