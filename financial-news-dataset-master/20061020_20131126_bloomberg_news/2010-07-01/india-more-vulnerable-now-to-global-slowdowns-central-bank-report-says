             India has become more vulnerable to
slowdowns and financial crises abroad as foreign trade plays a
bigger role in the economy, the central bank said.  
 “The shift in the composition of aggregate demand towards
exports during the current decade has made the Indian economy
more susceptible to global developments,” the Reserve Bank of
India’s research department said in a report in Mumbai.  
 Trade represented 35 percent of gross domestic product for
the year to March 31, 2008, up from 21 percent a decade earlier,
according to the central bank.  
 “The increased synchronization of the economy with the
rest of the world was discernible during the recent global
slowdown wherein India’s growth also decelerated despite having
unimpaired banking and financial systems,” the bank said.  
 The main challenge facing the bank now is to make a
“calibrated exit” from the pro-growth steps taken during the
global financial crisis, according to the report.  
 The RBI raised its  benchmark reverse repurchase rate  by a
quarter percentage point each in March and April to the current
level of 3.75 percent.
