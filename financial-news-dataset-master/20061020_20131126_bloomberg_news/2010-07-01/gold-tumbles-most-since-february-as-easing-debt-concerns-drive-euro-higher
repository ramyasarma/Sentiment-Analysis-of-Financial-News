             Gold futures tumbled the most since
February on signs that Europe’s financial industry may be in
better shape than investors estimated, curbing demand for the
metal as a haven.  
 Gold fell below $1,200 an ounce after the close of floor
trading on the Comex in New York. The  euro  headed for the
biggest gain since March 2009 against the dollar after European
banks borrowed less than the amount they are due to repay.
Yesterday, the European Central Bank said financial institutions
asked for less money than some analysts predicted in a three-
month offering.  
 “People are thinking maybe the European debt situation is
not so bad,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group
in Chicago. “Some of the safe-haven money is coming out of the
market.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $39.20, or 3.1
percent, to close at $1,206.70 in New York, marking the biggest
drop for a most-active contract since Feb. 4. The price touched
$1,198.40 in electronic trading after the settlement.  
 The metal has gained 10 percent this year, while the euro
is down 13 percent. Gold last traded below $1,200 on June 4.  
 Global equities and raw materials slumped as data on global
manufacturing and U.S. jobless claims fueled concern that the
economic recovery is faltering.  
 Oil, Industrial Metals  
 Crude oil fell 3.5 percent, and industrial metals tumbled.  
 “Fears of inflation are starting to abate,” eroding
demand for gold as a hedge, said  Barry James , who manages $2
billion as chief executive officer at James Investment Research
Inc. in Xenia, Ohio. Some people may be selling gold to buy
Treasuries because “bonds have been holding up exceptionally
well,” he said.  
 Bond returns are exceeding stock gains by the widest margin
in nine years as optimism that greeted the year evaporates and
investors around the world question the strength of the economic
recovery.  
 Gold will “be dictated by the sovereign-debt situation,”
Zeman of LaSalle Futures said. “The positivity is going to
fade,” and gold may jump to $1,300 in a few weeks, he said. The
metal reached a record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 Silver futures for September delivery dropped 91.8 cents,
or 4.9 percent, to $17.79 an ounce, marking the biggest decline
since May 4.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $30.50, or 2
percent, to $1,506.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery slid $15.35, or
3.5 percent, to $429.05 an ounce.
