             Toyota Motor Corp.  said an engine
flaw in its luxury Lexus brand may have been caused by defective
components.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, said today that as
many as 270,000 Lexus-brand cars may have a problem that causes
engines to stall. Last week the Toyota City, Japan-based company
recalled hybrid Lexus HS250h sedans because of a fuel-leak risk.  
 The engine problem may result from “contaminated materials
used in valve springs,”  Mark Templin , U.S. group vice president
and general manager of the Lexus brand, said today in a
conference call. “We want to take care of customers better than
anybody and take care of this as quickly as possible.”  
 Toyota is working to restore its reputation for quality
after  recalling  about 8 million vehicles globally for defects
linked to unintended acceleration. The company recalled about
13,000 Lexus GX 460 sport-utility vehicles in April after
Consumer Reports labeled the model a “safety risk” because it
could roll over under certain driving conditions. The
designation was removed in May.  
 As many as seven Lexus models and the Crown, a sedan sold
in the Japanese market, may be affected by the latest flaw, and
the carmaker is considering its next step to address the
problem, said  Ririko Takeuchi , a Toyota spokeswoman in Tokyo.  
 The models with engines that may stall are the Lexus
GS 350, GS 450h, GS 460, IS 350, LS 460, LS 600h and LS 600hL,
and the Toyota Crown, the company said today. About 90,000
vehicles may be affected in Japan, Takeuchi said.  
 Some models with 4.6-liter and 3.5-liter engines have a
problem with valve springs that may, in the worst case, cause
the engine to stall, Takeuchi said. The company hasn’t yet
determined if a recall will be necessary, Templin said.  
 Toyota said on June 25 it would stop selling the HS250h
after too much gasoline spilled in U.S. government crash tests,
posing a fire risk. The company, which paid a record $16.4
million U.S. fine this year for not complying with auto-safety
regulations, said in a letter to the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration that about 17,000 of 2010 model year
HS250h sedans would be recalled.
