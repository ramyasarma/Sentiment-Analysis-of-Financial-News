             Red Electrica Corp. SA , the manager
of Spain’s power grid, said it agreed to pay 1.27 billion euros
($1.59 billion) to utility  Endesa SA  for electricity
transportation assets in regions including the Balearic and
Canary Islands.  
 The agreement includes the additional purchase of power
transportation assets under construction valued at 142.3 million
euros, Red Electrica said today in a regulatory filing. The
company will use debt to finance the purchase, Chief Executive
Officer  Luis Atienza  said on a conference call. Red Electrica
plans to complete the transaction before year-end.  
 Endesa  CEO  Andrea Brentan  said May 11 that Spain’s second-
largest utility was sure it would complete a planned sale of the
assets to Red Electrica by a July deadline. Endesa is 92
percent-owned by Italy’s  Enel SpA , which gained control of the
Spanish company in 2007.  
 Red Electrica, which earns a fixed return on investments to
operate and maintain the high-voltage grid, said it’s keeping a
plan to invest 4 billion euros through 2014. Electricity demand
in mainland Spain has climbed this year after dropping 4.6
percent in 2009.  
 Investments in the first quarter rose 0.7 percent to 107.7
million euros from a year earlier, according to Red Electrica.
The Madrid-based company’s  net debt  rose 5.6 percent to 3.3
billion euros at the end of March.  
 Red Electrica  shares are down 27 percent this year, valuing
the company at 3.84 billion euros.
