             Australia’s dollar extended declines
after reports showed that retail sales growth slowed and
building approvals unexpectedly fell in May.  
 The so-called Aussie fell as much as 0.7 percent to 83.48
U.S. cents and traded at 83.69 cents as of 11:34 a.m. in Sydney,
from 84.08 cents yesterday in New York.
