             JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the second-
largest U.S. bank, named  Barry Sommers  to lead an effort to
boost the share of assets it holds for its wealthiest clients to
more than 5 percent.  
 Sommers, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Securities,
will become CEO of retail affluent and investment services,
JPMorgan said today in a statement from Business Wire. He’ll
report to  Charlie Scharf , head of retail financial services.  
 “Our initiative will help us serve customers better and
could increase pretax profits by $500 million to $1 billion
annually,” Scharf said in the statement.  
 Banks including  Morgan Stanley , Bank of America Corp. and
 Wells Fargo & Co.  are encouraging wealthy customers to do more
business with them as the weak economy and new regulations make
it harder to earn money from loans and investment banking.
Morgan Stanley plans to hire as many as 500 bankers to build its
private bank, a person familiar with the matter said.  
 The customers JPMorgan distinguishes as affluent typically
have at least $500,000 in investable assets, spokesman  Thomas Kelly  said in a telephone interview. JPMorgan Securities was
formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services.  
 JPMorgan  shares , down 15 percent this year compared with a
6.6 percent decrease in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials
Index , fell 3 percent to $35.48 as of 11:27 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
