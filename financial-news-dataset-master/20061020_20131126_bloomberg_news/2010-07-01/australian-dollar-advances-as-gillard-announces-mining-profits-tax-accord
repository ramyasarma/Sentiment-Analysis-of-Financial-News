             Australia’s dollar climbed against
most of its 16 major counterparts after Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  reached an agreement with mining companies on a new
resources tax, boosting demand for the nation’s assets.  
 The Aussie and the New Zealand dollar each gained for a
second day as government data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls shed
fewer jobs in June than forecast after a drop in temporary
government positions was eased by private-sector hiring.
Australia’s benchmark stock gauge, the S&P/ASX 200  Index , ended
eight days of declines.  
 “The mining-tax agreement is obviously a positive for
Australia,” said  Tony Allen , head of currency trading at ANZ
National Bank Ltd. in Wellington.  
 Australia’s currency appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to
85.11 U.S. cents before trading at 84.46 cents at 11:29 a.m. in
New York, up 0.1 percent from 84.34 cents yesterday. The
currency advanced 0.4 percent to 74.15 yen. New Zealand’s
dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.1 percent to 69.16 U.S. cents
and strengthened 0.3 percent to 60.69 yen.  
 The Aussie and kiwi still had their biggest weekly losses
in since May, 3.3 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, as
concern that growth is slowing in nations such as China prompted
investors to sell riskier assets. China is Australia’s largest
trading partner.  
 Australia’s mineral-resources rent tax will be 30 percent,
applying to iron ore and coal, while a tax on oil and gas
resources will be 40 percent, the government said in a
statement. Gillard’s predecessor,  Kevin Rudd , had proposed a 40
percent tax on all resources.  
 Political Stability  
 “The content of the deal is not really the issue for the
currency market,” said  Greg Gibbs , a foreign-exchange
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney. “It
is the political stability that it will tend to engender.”  
 U.S. payrolls fell by 125,000 last month, a Labor
Department report showed today, compared with a decrease of
130,000 forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
government cut 225,000 temporary workers conducting the 2010
census, it showed.  
 The number of jobs outside government rose by 83,000 last
month, the report showed, compared with a gain of 110,000
estimated in a Bloomberg survey and a revised increase of 33,000
in May.  
 The S&P/ASX 200 rose as much as 1 percent before ending the
day up less than 0.1 percent.
