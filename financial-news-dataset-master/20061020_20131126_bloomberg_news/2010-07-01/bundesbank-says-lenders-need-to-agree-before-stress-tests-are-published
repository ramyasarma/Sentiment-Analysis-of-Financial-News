             Bundesbank Vice President Franz-
Christoph Zeitler said stress tests “shall be published but
only with the agreement of the individual bank.”  
 Zeitler, speaking at a conference in Frankfurt today,
declined to say whether there has been an agreement on the
publication of stress tests and referred to a statement issued
by the Bundesbank and financial regulator BaFin yesterday.  
 Criteria for stress tests will be developed by the
Committee of European Banking Supervisors in cooperation with
the European Central Bank and the eurosystem of national central
banks, he said. Stress test results will probably be published
in the second half of July, he added.
