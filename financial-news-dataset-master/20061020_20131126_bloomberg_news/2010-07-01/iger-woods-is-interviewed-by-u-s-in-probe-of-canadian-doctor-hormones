             Tiger Woods  was interviewed by
federal investigators about his dealings with Anthony Galea, a
Canadian doctor who was charged with smuggling human growth
hormone and unlawfully distributing it within the U.S.  
 “Tiger willingly spoke to authorities and cooperated
fully,” the top-ranked golfer’s agent  Mark Steinberg  said in an
e-mail last night. “It was confirmed that, because he did
nothing illegal, he is not the subject of any criminal
investigation.”  
 Woods said at a news conference at the Masters Tournament
in April that Galea treated him while he recovered from June
2008 knee surgery. He said the doctor “never gave me HGH” or
any other performance-enhancing drug.  
 Galea, 50, was stopped at the border in early 2009 and told
by officials that he couldn’t bring certain medical supplies
into the U.S. Another person was caught in September bringing
supplies into New York at the direction of Galea, leading to the
smuggling charge, said prosecutors in the office of the U.S.
attorney in Buffalo, New York. Galea isn’t licensed to practice
in the U.S.  
 The interview with Woods is part of a second round of
meetings the authorities are conducting with athletes who have
been treated by Galea, the  New York Times said  on its website.  
 A voice-mail message left last night for Special Agent Earl
Gould, the media coordinator for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in Buffalo, wasn’t returned.

 Galea has also treated New York Yankees third baseman  Alex Rodriguez . The three-time Most Valuable Player told
investigators for Major League Baseball that he was seen by
Galea while recovering from 2009 hip surgery, according to the
Times. The treatment didn’t include banned substances,
Rodriguez, who admitted in February 2009 to using performance-
enhancing drugs from 2001 to 2003, told the newspaper.  
 The smuggling charge carries a maximum prison term of 20
years, prosecutors said. Another charge, of making false
statements to federal officials, carries a maximum five-year
term, as do the HGH and conspiracy charges. Introducing an
unapproved drug into interstate commerce carries a maximum
three-year term.  
 Brian Greenspan , an attorney for Galea at Greenspan,
Humphrey, Lavine in Toronto, didn’t return a message left at his
office after regular business hours last night.  
 The case is USA v. Galea, 10-mj-02078, U.S. District Court,
Western District of New York (Buffalo).
