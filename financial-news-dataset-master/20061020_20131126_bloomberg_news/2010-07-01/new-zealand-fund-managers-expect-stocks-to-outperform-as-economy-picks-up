             New Zealand fund managers expect
stock markets at home and abroad to outperform over the next
year as concerns over sovereign risk damp demand for bonds,
according to a survey by  Russell Investments.   
 All of the managers surveyed in early June were bullish on
international stocks and the majority gave a bullish ranking on
domestic equities, Russell’s Auckland-based unit said in an e-
mailed statement. The company asks managers to rate asset
classes on a scale of 1 to 7, with scores less than 4 defined as
bearish and more than 4 bullish.  
 New Zealand managers viewed the New Zealand stock market as
either fairly valued or undervalued as a result of its 6.8
percent fall in May, Russell said. The  NZX 50  index had its
first decline in five quarters in the three months ended June 30,
dropping 9.1 percent.  
 “There is a view that while some stocks appear cheap at
present, concerns around earnings growth and inflation mean that
they are considered cheap for a reason,” said Alister Van der
Maas, head of consulting for Russell in New Zealand.  
 Managers also expect economic growth to accelerate and the
New Zealand dollar to rise, the survey showed. Sentiment toward
local and overseas bonds is bearish, although pessimism toward
New Zealand debt isn’t as severe as three months ago during the
height of the Greek debt crisis.  
 Russell, whose indexes are used to benchmark $4.3 trillion
in assets, is a Tacoma, Washington-based unit of Northwestern
Mutual Life Insurance Co.
