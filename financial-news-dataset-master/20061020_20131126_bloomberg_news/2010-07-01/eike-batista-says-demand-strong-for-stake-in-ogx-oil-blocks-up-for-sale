             Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista 
said there’s strong demand for a 20 percent stake in seven oil
fields being sold by the energy company he controls,  OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA .  
 The divestitures may occur in six to eight months, and
there has been interest from “all the big boys” except  BP Plc ,
Batista said, referring to the London-based producer that is
struggling to control the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
Batista spoke to reporters today at the opening of the Sudeste
Port in Itaguai, Brazil.  
 OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro, owns licenses to explore
seven offshore blocks in Brazil’s Campos basin that may hold
estimated potential resources of 3.69 billion barrels of crude
and equivalents. That’s more than half the company’s total
estimated 6.7 billion barrels in its 29 blocks.  
 OGX hasn’t started commercial production of oil. The
company raised 6.7 billion reais ($3.7 billion) in an initial
public offering in 2008, a record at the time in Brazil.  
 OGX  rose 1.1 percent to 16.86 reais at 1:36 p.m. New York
time in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has risen 64 percent in the
past year.
