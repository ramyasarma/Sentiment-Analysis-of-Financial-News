             Nestle India Ltd. , a unit of the
world’s biggest foodmaker, gained the most in more than a month
after saying it is planning its first domestic acquisition.  
 The company plans to acquire a company “sooner than
later,” to expand its product line, Chairman and Managing
Director  Antonio Helio Waszyk  told reporters in Mumbai yesterday.
He didn’t give details or identify acquisition targets.  
 Nestle India  plans to expand into packaged-food items,
including breakfast cereals, Waszyk said. Working women, a
growing segment in the country, may have less time to prepare
traditional Indian breakfasts, boosting demand for cereals and
mixes.  
 The company intends to expand in India by widening its
portfolio of products, Waszyk said. India and China will account
for about 70 percent of the parent’s growth in the next decade,
he said.  
 The  shares  gained 2.2 percent, the biggest jump since May
24, to 2,942.9 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in
Mumbai. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
fell 1.1 percent.  
 The Indian food, beverages and tobacco market will grow an
average 7.5 percent annually during the five years ending 2013
to about $330 billion, according to an  April study  by New Delhi-
based market researcher RNCOS E-Services Pvt.
