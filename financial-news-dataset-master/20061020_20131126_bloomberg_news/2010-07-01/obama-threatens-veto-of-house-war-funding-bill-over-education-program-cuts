             The Obama administration threatened
to veto the House version of war-funding legislation because
Democrats cut some education programs from the plan to finance
$10 billion in aid to states to prevent teacher layoffs.  
 “The administration is more than willing to work with the
Congress to pursue fiscally responsible ways to finance
education jobs,” a White House statement said. “It would be
short-sighted to weaken funding for these reforms just as they
begin to show such promise.”  
 House Appropriations Committee Chairman  David Obey , the
lead sponsor of the legislation, said tough choices were needed
to ensure the money for teachers doesn’t add to the budget
deficit.  
 “I didn’t come here to be  Arne Duncan ’s congressman,”
said Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, referring to the secretary of
education. “Who do people think put the money into these
programs in the first place? I did.”  
 The Senate passed its measure to fund the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan in May.  
 The dispute threatens an intraparty fight over spending
just months before the congressional elections in November. It
also promises to delay the administration’s war-funding request,
first submitted in February, until at least mid-July. Congress
is off all of next week for a Fourth of July recess.  
 Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  urged lawmakers earlier this
month to approve the bill before leaving town. Otherwise, he
said, the department would be forced to do “stupid things”
such as taking money out of other programs to ensure adequate
war funding.
