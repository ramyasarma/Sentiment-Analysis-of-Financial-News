             Knauf Group lost an appeal at the
European Union’s highest court to overturn an 85.8 million-euro
($105.5 million) antitrust fine for a unit’s collusion on
plasterboard prices.  
 The unit, Knauf Gips, “is solely liable for the
infringements committed by the companies constituting the Knauf
Group,” the Luxembourg-based  European Court of Justice , the
EU’s top court, said today, upholding the fine by EU antitrust
regulators.  
 The ruling follows the EU court’s decision on June 17 to
reject a last challenge by  Lafarge SA , the world’s largest
cement maker, of its 249.6 million-euro fine in the cartel. The
penalties are part of a November 2002 decision by the European
Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator, to fine four companies
for fixing plasterboard prices in a scheme that ended in 1998.  
 The EU plasterboard market was worth about 1.2 billion
euros at the time of the breach. The Brussels-based commission
said collusion started in 1992 when BPB Ltd. and Knauf Group’s
Gips agreed to end a price war and lessen competition. An EU
court in 2008 cut the fine for BPB, a  Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA 
unit, to 118.8 million euros from 138.6 million euros.  
 Spokespeople at Iphofen, Germany-based Knauf Gips couldn’t
immediately be reached to comment.  
 The case is C-407/08, Knauf Gips v Commission.
