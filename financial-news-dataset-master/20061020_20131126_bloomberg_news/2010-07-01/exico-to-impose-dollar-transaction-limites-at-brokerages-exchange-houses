             Mexico will impose limits on dollar
transactions in cash at brokerages and exchange houses, the
latest step in an effort to root out money laundering by drug
traffickers.  
 The measure comes after rules announced this month limited
dollar deposits in cash at Mexican banks. Those rules capped
dollar deposits at $4,000 per month for Mexicans with accounts.  
 “In the coming days, similar measures will be published
for brokerages and exchange houses,” said  Guillermo Babatz , the
president of the National Banking and Securities Commission,
speaking before Congress today.  
 The measures aim to crack down on the finances of drug
traffickers and organized crime in Mexico. The nation’s
financial system receives about $10 billion a year whose origin
is difficult to track, according to Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero .  
 Babatz didn’t give details of the new measures in his
remarks today.  
 “This raises the costs of doing business for the
criminals,” said  Sergio Luna , an economist at Citigroup Inc.’s
Banamex unit in Mexico City. “That’s the only way to fight this
effectively.”
