             The U.K. Cabinet Office published
salary details of the highest earning executives at government
agencies known as “quangos” in a bid to reassure voters as the
coalition government drives through the biggest squeeze in
spending since World War II.  
 The 332 officials whose earnings were announced in London
today include Robin Evans, chief executive of  British Waterways ,
who earns as much as 234,999 pounds ($355,177) a year and  David Higgins , the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority,
whose salary is as much as 394,999 pounds.  
 “We are absolutely committed to acting quickly on pledges
in our coalition agreement to release information that will
allow everyone to hold their politicians and public bodies to
account,” Cabinet Office minister  Francis Maude  said in an e-
mailed statement. “This will not only increase accountability,
but will lead to more efficient public-service organizations.”  
 Among others named are Andrew Haines, who earns as much as
254,999 pounds as chief executive of the Civil Aviation
Authority, and Alan Langlands, who earns as much as 234,999
pounds as chief executive of the Higher Education Funding
Council for England.  
 At the end of May, the Cabinet Office published a list of
172 civil servants who earn more than 150,000 pounds.
