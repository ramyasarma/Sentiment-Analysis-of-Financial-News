             The dollar may slide further beyond a
seven-month low against the yen if the  Standard & Poor’s 500 
continues to fall, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 The dollar’s “violation of key support” at the 89.25-
88.95 yen level earlier this week implies “a breakdown is
underway which should allow for an extension of the current
decline,”  Niall O’Connor , a technical analyst in New York at
the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, wrote in a note
yesterday. Support refers to areas on charts where buy orders
are clustered.  
 The dollar yesterday fell 0.9 percent against the yen to
87.60 at in New York. It touched 86.97 yen, its weakest level
since Dec. 2.  
 “The story is really what’s going on in equities,”
O’Connor said in a telephone interview. “Even though we’ve
bounced off the lows, equities have had a rough day.”  
 The S&P 500 touched 1,010.91, the lowest intraday level
since Sept. 4, before closing at 1,027.31 in New York. The break
below the 1040 level “suggests that risk sentiment will remain
on the defensive,” according to the note.  
 Japan’s currency usually outperforms the dollar when U.S.
stocks decline, O’Connor said, and continued weakness in
equities could drive the dollar lower.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
