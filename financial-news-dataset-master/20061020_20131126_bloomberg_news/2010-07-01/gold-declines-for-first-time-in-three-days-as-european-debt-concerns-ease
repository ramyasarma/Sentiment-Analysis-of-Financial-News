             Gold futures tumbled the most since
February on signs that Europe’s financial industry may be in
better shape than investors estimated, curbing demand for the
metal as a haven.  
 The  euro  headed for the biggest gain in 13 months against
the dollar after European banks borrowed less than the amount
they are due to repay. Yesterday, the European Central Bank said
financial institutions asked for less money than some analysts
predicted in a three-month offering. Before today, gold jumped
14 percent this year while the euro slumped 15 percent.  
 “People are thinking maybe the European debt situation is
not so bad,” said  Matt Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group
in Chicago. “Some of the safe-haven money is coming out of the
market.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $27.40, or 2.2
percent, to $1,218.50 an ounce at 11:14 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. A close at that price would mark the biggest drop for a
most-active contract since Feb. 4.  
 Prices will “be dictated by the sovereign-debt
situation,” Zeman said. “The positivity is going to fade,”
and gold may jump to $1,300 in a few weeks, he said. The metal
reached a record $1,266.50 on June 21.  
 “The gold bubble is intact” until the Federal
Reserve increases interest rates, said  Frank Lesh , a trader at
FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. He said borrowing costs will
increase in the second half. The Fed has left the overnight
interbank lending-rate target at a  record low  since December
2008.  
 Silver futures for September delivery dropped 72.3 cents,
or 3.9 percent, to $17.98 an ounce.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery fell $34.10, or 2.2
percent, to $1,503.20 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery declined $19.40,
or 4.4 percent, to $429.75 an ounce.
