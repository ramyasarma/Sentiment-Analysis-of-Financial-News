             LLX Logistica SA , the company
building Brazil’s largest port, said Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
Mercuria Energy Asset Management BV may build storage facilities
at the $40 billion project to tap into growing offshore oil
output.  
 Shell and Mercuria, an oil trader operating in more than 50
countries, have signed preliminary accords to build facilities
at the Acu port in Rio de Janeiro state, LLX Chief Executive
Otavio Lazcano said. Total storage capacity may reach 1.5
million barrels per day, he said.  
 LLX , which is controlled by billionaire Eike Batista, is
betting on Brazil’s potential to double oil output in the next
decade by tapping deepwater fields, including the Americas’
largest crude discovery in more than three decades. Oil
shipments will be the Acu port’s second-biggest source of
revenue, after iron-ore exports, Lazcano said.  
 “Oil will come as an additional bonus,” Lazcano said
yesterday in an interview at the port. “The additional free
 cash flow  will be sky high for LLX’s shareholders.”  
 LLX shares fell 1.6 percent to 7.36 reais in Sao Paulo
trading yesterday.  
 The stock has surged 93 percent in the past year, outpacing
the 18 percent gain for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index and the
67 percent increase by OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA.
Shares of Batista’s shipbuilder OSX Brasil SA have plunged 33
percent since the company’s initial public offering in March.  
 Campos’s Backyard  
 Oil company OGX plans to start producing from the offshore
Campos Basin next year, Lazcano said. LLX is seeking to lure
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Repsol YPF SA, Statoil ASA and Chevron
Corp., which all produce in Campos, the basin that accounts for
85 percent of Brazil’s crude output.  
 “At some point I will knock on their door for obvious
reasons,” Lazcano said about Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-
controlled oil producer is known. “Acu is in the Campos Basin’s
backyard.”  
 Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli
plans to double output to 5.38 million barrels a day by 2020,
from 2.7 million barrels in 2010.  
 Acu is LLX’s largest project. LLX is also building the
Sudeste port in Rio de Janeiro state that will have about half
the capacity.  
 LLX has held talks over storage facilities with  BP Plc ,
which agreed to buy Devon Energy Corp.’s Brazil operations as
part of a $7 billion deal announced in March, Lazcano said.  
 Devon previously signed a memorandum of understanding for
the project, he said.  
 A voicemail message left with Shell’s media line was not
immediately returned. Devon spokesman Chip Minty said the
company is in the process of “divesting our assets in Brazil.”  
 LLX is seeking environmental permits to build the oil
storage and treatment facilities at Acu, where Mercuria may
build 400,000-barrel per day storage capacity, Lazcano said. The
company aims to begin shipments of iron ore, crude oil and
cement from Acu in 2012.  
 Batista has said he expects the Acu port project to attract
$40 billion of investments over 10 years.
