             Scotland will likely lag behind the
U.K. in economic growth and employment as the impact of the
spending cuts announced by the government last month is felt on
the economy, according to the  Fraser of Allander Institute .  
 Over the next five years Scotland will lose 64,000 and
126,000 jobs as a result of the cutbacks, the Glasgow-based
research body that’s part of Strathclyde University, said in its
quarterly  economic commentary . The Scottish economy will also
grow more slowly than the U.K. this year and in 2011 and 2012.  
 “As the Scottish economy emerges from recession a slowly
strengthening recovery is threatened by the massive fiscal
consolidation package” announced in the Budget on June 22,
 Brian Ashcroft , director of the institute, said in the
commentary published on its website  
 The U.K. is set to cut 610,000 public-sector workers over
the next five years as the coalition government implements the
deepest spending squeeze since World War II. As many as 90,000
public-sector jobs may be lost in Scotland over the next four
years, Fraser of Allander estimates.  
 Total U.K. employment is expected is rise by 1.34 million
over the next five years after allowing for job losses caused by
the spending cuts, the Office for Budget Responsibility said
yesterday. The net jobs growth in Scotland between 2010 and 2012
may be just over 17,000, according to the institute.  
 The Scottish economy may grow 0.7 percent this year, 1.1
percent in 2011 and 2.1 percent in 2012, Fraser of Allander
estimated in its report.  
 The Office for Budget Responsibility said its central
forecast for the U.K. economy shows growth of 1.2 percent this
year, 2.3 percent next year and 2.8 percent the year after.
