             E.ON Energie AG , a unit of Germany’s
largest utility, plans to sell its stake in  BKW FMB Energie AG 
to BKW and Groupe E AG for 526 million euros ($643 million)
following a “reassessment” of its strategy.  
 BKW is paying 64.30 Swiss francs a share, or 304.3 million
francs ($284 million) in a first step, the Bern, Switzerland-
based utility said in an e-mailed statement. E.ON is selling a
total stake of about 21 percent.  
 E.ON acquired its stake in the Swiss utility in two stages
in 1997 and 1999 and now wants to sell its entire holding in BKW
because it is reassessing its strategy.  
 “The share repurchase reinforces BKW’s autonomy as a
company, strengthens the existing cross-shareholding between BKW
and Groupe E, and will result in the existing partnership being
stepped up,” the company said.  
 The sale will be carried out in two phases, with BKW
initially buying 8.9 percent of the shares and Groupe E 5.01
percent. At the same time an option agreement with a term until
September 2011 grants BKW the right to acquire the remaining
stake of around 7 percent in a second phase.  
 The purchase increases Groupe E’s stake in BKW to 10
percent.
