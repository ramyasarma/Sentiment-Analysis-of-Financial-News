             Japan’s 10-year bond yields may fall
below 1 percent for the first time since Aug. 14, 2003 as the
faltering U.S. recovery boosts demand for government debt,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc.  
 Benchmark 10-year  yields  hit 1.125 percent on June 24,
dropping below a low of 1.155 percent reached three months
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in
September 2008. Yields extended declines to 1.075 percent
yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 15, 2003.  
 “It’s highly likely the U.S. cyclical recovery has
reached its peak,” said  Seiji Shiraishi , chief economist for
Japan at HSBC in Tokyo. “Along with China, we’re losing a key
driver of global growth.”  
 There are a full complement of factors to drive demand for
Japanese debt, according to  Satoshi Yamada , manager of fixed-
income trading at Okasan Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. In
addition to the European debt crisis and Japan’s anticipated
fiscal consolidation, “we now have concerns about the U.S.
economic outlook and protracted low interest rates,” he said.  
 Federal Reserve officials retained a pledge to keep the
benchmark rate at a record low for an “extended period” on
June 23, spurring demand for Japanese debt the next day.  
 Ten-year Treasury yields tumbled below 3 percent this week
for the first time since April 2009, after reports showed
 consumer confidence  slumped. Employment fell in June for the
first time this year, economists said before the July 2 report.  
 “With the market having yet to price in a drop in U.S.
payrolls, both Japanese and U.S. yields may decline further,”
said  Yasunari Ueno , chief market economist at Mizuho Securities
Co. in Tokyo.
