             LeBron James  is expected to meet
with the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Clippers today, a day
after he was courted by the New York area’s two National
Basketball Association franchises as free agency began.  
 James, 25, is scheduled to follow a visit from the
Heat in the morning with a meeting with the Clippers in the
afternoon, the  Cleveland Plain Dealer  reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the player’s schedule.  
 The Chicago Bulls may follow tomorrow before he sits
down with the Cleveland Cavaliers, with whom he’s spent his
entire seven-year NBA career, the newspaper said.  
 James, the league’s reigning two-time Most Valuable
Player, held interviews yesterday with the New Jersey Nets
and New York Knicks at the IMG building in Cleveland, where
his manager Maverick Carter has an office. Outside,
Cavaliers fans stood with signs that reminded him of
“home” and “community.”  
 His first meeting with the Nets was led by new team
owner  Mikhail Prokhorov , minority owner  Jay-Z , the rapper
who is friends with James, and new coach  Avery Johnson .  
 “It went well,” Johnson said as the Nets contingent
left for Chicago, where the team executives will speak
today with free agents  Dwyane Wade  and  Chris Bosh ,
according to the Associated Press.  
 ‘Cautiously Optimistic’  
 As the Nets departed, a group from the Knicks entered,
including team president  Donnie Walsh , coach  Mike D’Antoni 
and former guard  Allan Houston .  
 “We tried to put him in a New York state of mind,”
D’Antoni said in televised comments to reporters after the
meeting. “Hopefully it worked out. It was a good meeting,
and we’re cautiously optimistic.”  
 The Knicks’ sales pitch included how James could
become a billionaire -- one of his stated goals -- more
easily in New York than by playing in cities such as Miami,
Chicago or Cleveland. The team commissioned a study from
marketing consultant Interbrand that showed James could
earn as much as $2 billion playing in New York, according
to  Forbes.com .  
 The Nets, who will play in Newark, New Jersey, the
next two seasons before moving into a new arena in the
Brooklyn borough of New York, may also benefit from the
calculations of their local rivals.
