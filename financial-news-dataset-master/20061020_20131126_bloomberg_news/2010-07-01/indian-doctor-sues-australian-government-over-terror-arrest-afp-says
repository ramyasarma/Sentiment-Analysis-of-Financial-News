             Indian doctor Mohamed Haneef, wrongly
charged in connection with botched terror attacks in Britain,
today sued the Australian government for unlawful arrest and
abuse of power, Agence France-Presse reported, citing a lawyer.  
 Haneef, who was incorrectly linked to the militants
responsible for the failed June 2007 car bombings in London and
Glasgow, launched legal action in the Brisbane Supreme Court
over his arrest and two-week detention without charge through
his Australian lawyers, said Rod Hodgson, a partner at the
Maurice Blackburn firm, which is handling Haneef’s case.
