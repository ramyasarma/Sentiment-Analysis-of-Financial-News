             Bookings of tankers to ship European
gasoline to the U.S. doubled in June from a month ago as higher
gasoline prices in the U.S. attracted cargoes.  
 U.S. gasoline’s premium over European averaged 14.4 cents a
gallon in June, up 8.2 percent from May, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. At least 30 vessels were booked in June
to send gasoline to the U.S. Atlantic coast from Europe, up from
15 a month ago, ship-bookings information compiled by  Clarkson
Research Services Ltd.  showed.  
 The ships carried at least 1.14 million metric tons, or
about 9.69 million barrels, of the automotive fuel in June, up
from 549,000 metric tons in May, according to Clarkson Research,
a unit of the world’s biggest shipbroker.  
 The rate to ship gasoline from the European continent to
the U.S. Atlantic coast rose to  Worldscale 180.25  yesterday, or
about  $12,935 a day  after fuel costs, the highest level since
March 2, according to London-based Baltic Exchange.  
 Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange traded
at a premium of 21.58 cents a gallon on June 25 over  the spot
price of European gasoline , the highest level this year,
according to Bloomberg data. The premium averaged 13.34 cents in
May.  
 The data from Clarkson Research were drawn from single-
voyage bookings and no long-term charters were included.
