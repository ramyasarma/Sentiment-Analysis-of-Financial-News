             Copper, aluminum and zinc dropped
after manufacturing in China, the world’s largest metals
consumer, expanded at a slower pace for a second month,
signaling that demand growth may be weakening.  
 Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 2.4 percent to
$6,360 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and traded
$6,369 at 3:04 p.m. in Shanghai. Aluminum declined 1.8 percent
to $1,942.50 a ton and zinc lost 2.4 percent to $1,750.  
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.1 from 53.9 in
May, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today.
That was less than the median 53.2 estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 12 economists. Asian equities headed for a third day
of losses, extending a global first-half slump.  
 “Equities’ slump signals a bearish outlook for the
economy” and metals demand,  Tan Wentao , an analyst at HNA
Topwin Futures Co., said from Shanghai.  
 Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut Spain’s top
credit rating. The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw
materials fell 5.4 percent in the second quarter, the worst
three-month period since the end of 2008, on signs growing
budget deficits from Greece to Spain may stunt the global
economic recovery.  
 “The likelihood is very high that copper may test
previous lows given economic fundamentals are” turning bearish
in the middle of the year, Wang Jian, an analyst at Minmetals
Haiqin Futures Co. said from Beijing today. Copper touched an
eight-month low of $6,037.50 on June 7.  
 China’s government has told banks to set aside more money
as reserves, and cracked down on property speculation. Clamping
down on local-government borrowing to contain risks from last
year’s explosion in debt could also limit growth.  
 Copper for October delivery fell as much as 1.5 percent to
51,040 yuan ($7,524) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and
closed at that level. Shanghai aluminum dropped 0.6 percent to
14,605 yuan and zinc declined 0.8 percent to 14,500 yuan.  
 Lead for three-month delivery in London fell 2.1 percent
to $1,713 a ton, nickel slumped 2 percent to $19,350 a ton and
tin lost 0.7 percent to $17,300 a ton.
