             International Business Machines
Corp. , the world’s largest computer-services provider, agreed to
buy closely held BigFix Inc., gaining programs that automate
security and compliance.  
 The price is about $400 million, according to a person
familiar with the matter. Armonk, New York-based IBM said in a
statement today it’s not disclosing the terms. BigFix software
identifies devices that aren’t in compliance with corporate
policy and recommends fixes in real-time.  
 IBM Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano  has said he is
planning to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions in the next
five years. The software unit, the company’s most profitable,
will make up about half of total earnings in 2015, the company
said in May. The unit has made about 60 acquisitions since 2003.  
 BigFix , based in Emeryville, California, has about 200
employees and 700 customers, including SunTrust Bank. The deal
is expected to close this quarter.  
 IBM  fell  91 cents to $122.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 6.4 percent
this year.
