             Philadelphia Phillies second baseman
 Chase Utley  is scheduled to have surgery on his right thumb
today, three days after injuring it while trying to stretch a
single into a double.  
 Utley, who leads all National League second basemen in
voting for the July 13 All-Star Game, will undergo the procedure
at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, the Phillies
said in a news release.  
 The team didn’t say how long Utley, who was placed on the
15-day disabled list on June 29 with a sprained ulnar collateral
ligament of the thumb, would be out of action. He could miss
five to six weeks, according to MLB Network.  
 Utley, 31, is batting .277 with 11 home runs, 37 runs
batted in and 49 runs scored this season.
