             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for a third day, retreating 249.29, or 1
percent, to 26,009.53, after losing 8.7 percent in the three
months through June, the first decline in a quarter since the
period ending March 2009.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  (ANG SJ), Africa’s largest gold
producer, fell 10.95 rand, or 3.3 percent, to 321 rand, the
biggest drop in almost five months. Gold futures tumbled the
most since February on signs that Europe’s financial industry
may be in better shape than investors estimated, curbing demand
for the metal as a haven.  
 Aquarius Platinum Ltd.  (AQP SJ) slumped 3.49 rand, or 8.5
percent, to 37.50 rand, the biggest drop since May 20.  Anglo
Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), the world’s biggest platinum producer,
declined 19.50 rand, or 2.7 percent, to 709.50 rand. The metal
used in clean-emissions technology by carmakers retreated for a
fourth day, dropping as much as 2.7 percent to $1,492.25 an
ounce.  
 Separately, Aquarius said a safety review will be conducted
at the Blue Ridge Platinum Mine in South Africa’s eastern
Mpumalanga province following two fatal accidents in the past
month. The review will have a short-term production impact,
Aquarius said.  
 Pick n Pay Stores Ltd.  (PIK SJ) climbed 80 cents, or 1.8
percent, to 44.20 rand, the biggest gain in two weeks. South
Africa’s second-largest food retailer agreed to sell its
Australian unit, Franklins, to Metcash Trading Ltd. for A$215
million ($180 million).  
 Sasol Ltd.  (SOL SJ), the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, dropped 3.10 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 271.50
rand, the lowest since June 8. Crude oil fell the most in almost
five months, sliding as much as 4.3 percent to $72.49 a barrel
after U.S. manufacturing expanded at a slower pace last month
and the Labor Department reported that more Americans applied
for jobless benefits last week. China’s manufacturing grew at a
reduced pace for a second month in June, adding to signs the
fastest-growing major economy is cooling, according to a survey.
