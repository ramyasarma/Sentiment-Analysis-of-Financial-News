             The European Central Bank said it
will lend banks 111.2 billion euros ($136.5 billion) for six
days to help them cope with the expiry of its landmark 12-month
loan today.  
 The Frankfurt-based ECB said 78 banks asked for the six-day
funds at the benchmark interest rate of 1 percent. Banks today
need to repay 442 billion euros in 12-month loans, the biggest
amount ever awarded by the ECB. Banks asked for 131.9 billion
euros in three-month loans yesterday, less than economists
expected.  
 Today’s allotment “is a reasonably big number,” said
 Laurent Bilke , an economist at Nomura International in London.
“Together with yesterday’s operation, the funding needs come in
on the high side of estimates. However, the banks that are
overly reliant on the ECB are on the periphery of Europe, it’s
not stress across the board.”  
 European banking stocks fell, led by  Bank of Ireland Plc 
and Austria’s  Raiffeisen International Bank Holding AG . The
Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index was down 2.2
percent as of 10:38 a.m. in London. The euro was little changed
at $1.2290.  
 Europe’s sovereign debt crisis made financial institutions
wary of lending to each other, complicating the ECB’s withdrawal
of non-standard stimulus measures used to fight last year’s
financial crisis. While the ECB no longer offers banks 12-month
loans, the debt crisis has forced it to reintroduce unlimited
lending in its three- and six-month refinancing operations and
to start buying the bonds of big-deficit governments.
