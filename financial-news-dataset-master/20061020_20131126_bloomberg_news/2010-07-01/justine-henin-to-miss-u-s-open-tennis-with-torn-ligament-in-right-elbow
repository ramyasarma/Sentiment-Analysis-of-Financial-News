             Justine Henin  has a torn ligament in
her right elbow that will force the seven-time Grand Slam winner
to miss at least two months of competition, including the U.S.
Open tennis championship in New York.  
 Henin, who returned to the women’s tour this year after a
20-month break, was injured during her fourth-round loss to  Kim Clijsters  four days ago at Wimbledon.  
 After winning the first set against Clijsters, Henin
slipped on the grass and fell as she rushed to the net during
the third game of the second set. Henin said on her  website  that
tests revealed a partially torn ligament.  
 Henin, 28, said she’ll miss the July 8 Best of Belgium
exhibition match against Clijsters and will have further tests
in a month “that will give me certainty about the end of this
season.”  
 The U.S. Open, which Henin won in 2003 and 2007, is
scheduled for Aug. 30 to Sept. 12.
