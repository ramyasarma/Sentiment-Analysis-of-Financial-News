             The  infrequency  of U.S. stocks
falling to lows indicates the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
bottom out after slumping about 2.1 percent from yesterday’s
close, according to Strategas Research Partners LLC.  
 The  S&P 500  tumbled 15 percent to 1,030.71 through
yesterday after surging to a 19-month high on April 23. Since
then, an average of 25 companies listed on the New York Stock
Exchange hit 52-week lows each day, with a peak of 101 on June
8, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The number of
companies at lows jumped to 667 on March 6, 2009, as the S&P 500
was sinking to the weakest level in 12 years.  
 “New 52-week NYSE lows remain anemic,”  Christopher Verrone ,
the lead technical analyst at Strategas, and  Nicholas Bohnsack ,
the operating partner at the New York-based research firm, wrote
in a report yesterday. “Stocks still have support beneath them.”  
 Verrone and Bohnsack said the stock index probably won’t
fall below 1,009 in the short term and that a rally is unlikely
until the S&P 500 slips closer to that level. The measure
dropped as low as 1,010.91 today.  
 The current level of companies whose share prices have
fallen to lows is “uncharacteristic of the set-up that precedes
major weakness,” Verrone and Bohnsack wrote. An S&P 500 retreat
to 973.82 would put it 20 percent below its April peak, meeting
the common definition of a bear market.
