             Manufacturing in the U.S. probably
expanded in June for an 11th consecutive month, powered by gains
in exports and business investment, economists said before
reports today.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s  factory index  fell
last month to 59, close to an almost six-year high, from 59.7 in
May, according to the  median  estimate of 79 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News. Readings greater than 50 signal growth. Other
reports may show declines in construction spending and the
number of contracts to buy previously owned homes in May.  
 Companies like  Deere & Co.  and  3M Co.  are receiving more
orders as customers update equipment and rebuild inventories,
helping the economy recover from the worst recession since the
1930s. A pickup in production is also prompting factories to
hire, indicating growth in the industry will help the U.S.
endure the European debt crisis.  
 “Manufacturing has been about the only bright spot,” said
 David Resler , chief economist at Nomura Securities International
Inc. in New York. The economy is “still growing, but the pace
of activity does seem to have decelerated abruptly,” he said.  
 Other figures today showed manufacturing in China and
Europe is cooling. China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to
52.1 in June from 53.9 the previous month. A gauge of factory
output in the 16-member euro region declined to 55.6 last month
from 55.8.  
 April Reading  
 The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM’s report is due at 10 a.m. New
York time. Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 55.9 to
61.2. In April, the measure rose to 60.4, the highest since June
2004.  
 Also at 10 a.m., figures from the Commerce Department will
show construction spending fell 0.8 percent in May after a gain
of 2.7 percent the prior month, according to the median estimate
of 54 economists surveyed. Projections ranged from a drop of 3
percent to a gain of 0.5 percent.  
 Manufacturing, which accounts for about 11 percent of the
economy, has been a leader in the recovery as demand from abroad
strengthened and U.S. firms picked up  production  and spending to
meet demand after a record drawdown in inventories last year.
The gains have encouraged hiring in the industry.  
 Factories have added 126,000  workers  during the first five
months of this year, matching the most successive gains since
2006, according to the Labor Department. Manufacturers added
another 25,000 employees in June, economists said before
tomorrow’s monthly jobs report from the Labor Department.  
 Factory Shares  
 The manufacturing shares have outperformed the market. The
Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Industrial Machinery Index of
52 companies, including Deere and Caterpillar Corp., has
increased 0.6 percent this year compared with a 7.6 percent
decline in the broader S&P 500.  
 Manufacturers in the U.S. are forecasting further gains.
3M, the maker of 55,000 products from Post-it Notes to Scotch
tape, this week projected second-quarter sales that topped
analysts’ estimates as demand recovers.  
 Sales will be $6.6 billion to $6.75 billion, the St. Paul,
Minnesota-based company said in a June 28 statement. Analysts
predicted $6.56 billion, the average of eight estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Total-dollar sales are projected to rise 4 percent
to 6 percent compared with the first quarter of 2010.  
 While manufacturing growth is being sustained, the housing
market is struggling following the expiration at the end of
April of a homebuyer tax credit.  
 The National Association of Realtors will publish its index
of signed purchase agreements, or pending  home resales , at 10
a.m. today. The figures will show a 14 percent decline in May
after three months of gains, according to the survey.  
 Figures from the Labor Department will show jobless claims
declined to a level that indicates improvement in the labor
market is taking time to unfold. First-time filings for
unemployment benefits dropped to 455,000 last week from 457,000,
according to the median estimate in the Bloomberg survey.
