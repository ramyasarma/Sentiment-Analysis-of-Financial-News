             New York’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority reduced the week’s largest Build
America offering 16 percent to $467.7 million as its yield
premium over Treasuries rose 31 percent since February.  
 The MTA, operator of the nation’s largest mass-transit
system, paid a yield spread of 2.75 percentage points on 30-year
debt relative to a benchmark Treasury due in 2040, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-nine-year Build Americas in a
February issue sold at 2.1 percentage points over a benchmark
Treasury. The agency was scheduled to borrow $555 million this
week.  
 Since the February sale, the average Build America yield
spread above 30-year Treasuries has widened about  47 basis
points , to about two percentage points. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  
 Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the authority, declined to
comment on the sale.  
 Build Americas in the two sales are rated A by Standard &
Poor’s and are backed by transportation revenue. In a March
Build America sale in which the securities were backed by
dedicated state levies such as fuel taxes and rated AA by S&P,
the transportation network sold 30-year debt at 1.5 percentage
points over Treasuries.  
 Build America securities yielded  5.89 percent  on average on
June 30, according to a Wells Fargo index. Benchmark 30-year
 Treasuries  yield about 3.88 percent.  
 Stimulus Program  
 Build America debt, created last year as part of the
federal economic stimulus program, is the fastest-growing part
of the $2.8 trillion municipal market. Issuers are eligible for
a 35 percent subsidy on interest-rate costs from the U.S.
Treasury. About $118 billion of the securities have been sold,
Bloomberg data show.  
 The MTA offering came as the future of the program, which
is set to expire in December, is still undetermined. A two-year
extension is part of a jobs bill that has stalled in Congress.
Passed by the House of Representatives in May, the provision
would cut federal subsidies to borrowers to 32 percent in 2011
and 30 percent in 2012.  
 Issuers have sold about $968 million of Build Americas this
week, Bloomberg data show.
