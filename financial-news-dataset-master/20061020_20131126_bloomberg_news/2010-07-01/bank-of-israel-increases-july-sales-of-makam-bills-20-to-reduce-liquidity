             The Bank of Israel will sell 20
percent more 12-month bills this month than it sold in June, as
it seeks to reduce liquidity after record dollar purchases
increased the number of shekels in circulation.  
 “That shows the Bank of Israel is aware of inflation risk
and is trying to help the market absorb the high liquidity of
money,” said  Moshik Yaniv , head of the local fixed income desk
at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd.  
 The central bank plans to sell 12 billion shekels ($3.1
billion of so-called Makam bills in July, compared with 10
billion shekels sold in June, according to its  website . It also
plans to sell 3 billion shekels of 91-day Makams this month.  
 The central bank is using other tools to absorb liquidity
and dampen inflation after holding interest rates on concern
global growth is slowing. Governor  Stanley Fischer  on June 28
left the benchmark lending rate unchanged at 1.5 percent for a
third month, citing “increased uncertainties in the global
economy.”  
 Central banks conduct auctions of bills to drain excess
local currency stemming from foreign purchases, a process known
as sterilization. Foreign currency reserves were at $63.4
billion in May, near a record high, after Fischer began buying
in March 2008 in an attempt to limit gains in the shekel and
help exporters weather the economic crisis.  
 Inflation  was at 3 percent for a second month in May, the
upper end of the central bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent target
range.  
 Bonds Rise  
 The 10-year Mimshal Shiklit maturing in January 2020
increased 0.10 shekel to 105.80 at the close in Tel Aviv,
pushing the yield on the 5 percent notes down one basis point to
4.51 percent, the lowest level since the bonds were issued.  
 “Institutional investors in the bond market speak of a
bubble in sovereign bonds,” Yaniv said. “But most of them are
afraid of getting out” as panic in the global market persists.  
 The shekel was little changed at 3.8892 to the dollar at
5:56 p.m. in Tel Aviv.
