             The People’s Bank of China sold
three-year bills at a yield of 2.68 percent, unchanged in a
second straight sale, according to traders at Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and BOC International (China) Ltd.  
 The yield dropped at four previous sales since the central
bank resumed bi-weekly offerings of the securities April 8 to
help drain cash from the financial system.  
 The monetary authority offered 22 billion yuan ($3.2
billion) of the securities at the auction today.
