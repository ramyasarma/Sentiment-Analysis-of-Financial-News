             Defending champion Serena Williams
beat Petra Kvitova in straight sets today to reach the Wimbledon
tennis final for a third straight year.  
 The 28-year-old American, ranked No. 1 by the WTA Tour, won
7-6 (7-5), 6-2 on Centre Court at the All England Club and will
next face Russia’s Vera Zvonareva, the No. 21 seed.  
 Williams took this year’s Australian Open to secure her
12th Grand Slam title, a haul that includes three Wimbledon
championships.  
 Kvitova of the Czech Republic had previously never been
beyond the first round at Wimbledon and was playing her first
Grand Slam semifinal.
