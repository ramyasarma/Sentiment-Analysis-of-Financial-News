             Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. ,
Japan’s third-largest listed bank by assets, said it agreed with
Barclays Plc to co-operate on private banking in Japan.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui set up a department in its brokerage unit
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. in April to cooperate with
Barclays in providing investment products, the statement said.
The department’s staff will include salespeople and product
development experts, Lee Meng Gan, a spokesman for Barclays in
Singapore said by phone.  
 The new venture will compete for a share of the more than
$16 trillion in financial assets held by Japanese households, 55
percent of which were in deposits and cash as of March 31,
according to the Bank of Japan. Barclays and Sumitomo Mitsui
will target affluent individuals in and around Tokyo and Osaka
with 500 million yen ($5.7 million) or more of investible assets,
Gan said.  
 Barclays will send nine people to work in the department,
which will have 28 members, Gan said.  Sumitomo Mitsui  and
London-based Barclays also set up a joint service company to
support the private banking venture, by providing translations
of Barclays research and other products in Japan.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui took a 50.1 percent stake in the servicing
company, established in March, while Barclays holds the
remainder, the Japanese bank said in today’s statement.
