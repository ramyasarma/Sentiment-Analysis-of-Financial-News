             Dendreon Corp.  fell as much as 13
percent in stock trading after the U.S. agency supervising
Medicare and Medicaid said it would review coverage of the
company’s Provenge prostate-cancer treatment.  
 Dendreon declined $2.95, or 9.1 percent, to $29.38 at 10:08
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier, the
shares plunged to $28.01, for the biggest drop in two months.  
 The analysis by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services will look at the medicine’s effectiveness in
determining whether to reimburse patients, and won’t factor in
the drug’s cost. The review also won’t affect existing insurance
coverage for the product, priced at about $93,000 for an average
course of treatment, Dendreon said yesterday in a statement.  
 “While we recognize keeping the faith here is difficult,”
a decision not to cover Provenge is “highly unlikely,” said
 Christopher Raymond , an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co., in a
note to clients.  
 Dendreon, based in Seattle, said it will work with the U.S.
agency during the review to “ensure patients with advanced
prostate cancer have broad access to Provenge.” Medicare covers
the elderly and disabled with federal money, while Medicaid is a
federal and state program providing health insurance for the
poor.  
 Provenge takes a new approach to treating cancer, drawing
blood from the patient’s body and training the immune system to
attack malignant cells. On average, the medicine helped patients
live an extra four months in testing, or twice the benefit of
chemotherapy, and with fewer side effects.  
 The  shares  have declined 42 percent since Provenge received
U.S. regulatory approval on April 29 on concerns that Dendreon
won’t have enough supply of the drug to meet demand. Dendreon
can make enough Provenge to treat only about 2 percent of
eligible patients until manufacturing increases in mid-2011, the
company has said. Hospitals are rationing the drug and setting
up waiting list for patients.  
 Each year, more than 27,000 men die of prostate cancer in
the U.S. and about 200,000 new patients are identified,
according to the American Cancer Society, based in Atlanta.
