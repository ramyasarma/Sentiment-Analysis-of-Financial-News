             Chinese health-care stocks dropped
the most among industry groups on the CSI 300 Index today on
concern that valuations are too high relative to earnings
prospects.  
 Yunnan Baiyao Group Co., a manufacturer of traditional
Chinese medicines, fell 2 percent to 63.20 yuan as of 2:33 p.m.
in Shenzhen. The health-care index slid 3.3 percent today,
sending its price-earnings ratio to 22 times. The broader CSI
300 trades at 16.9 times reported earnings after a 29 percent
loss this year.  
 “Investors gave a high premium to pharmaceutical stocks to
reflect their defensive nature,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based
fund manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “As most sectors become cheaper after the decline on
the broader market, investors are now considering rerating
valuations of pharmaceutical stocks.”  
 Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. retreated 4 percent to 37.50
yuan. Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment Co. slid 4.8 percent to
33.60 yuan.
