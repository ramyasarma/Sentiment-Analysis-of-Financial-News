             Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. , which lobbied Congress to exclude its derivatives
contracts from new collateral requirements, may get its way as
the financial regulatory overhaul nears approval.  
 The new rules won’t alter previously written derivative
contracts, Democratic Senators  Chris Dodd  of Connecticut and
Arkansas’s Blanche Lincoln told Democratic Representatives
 Barney Frank  of Massachusetts and Minnesota’s  Collin Peterson  in
a letter. Dodd is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.  
 “We provided legal certainty to those contracts currently
in existence, providing that no contract could be terminated,
renegotiated, modified, amended or supplemented (unless
otherwise specified in the contract) based on the
implementation” of the new rules, Dodd and Lincoln said in the
letter, dated June 30. “It is imperative that we provide
certainty to these existing contracts for the sake of our
economy and financial system.”  
 The Senate may vote on the financial-overhaul bill after
the week-long July 4 recess, following the approval yesterday by
the House of Representatives. The measure would be
the biggest rewrite of Wall Street rules since the Great
Depression. Among the provisions is a requirement for
corporations to post collateral for certain contracts, according
to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.  
 “It is a positive thing for Berkshire Hathaway,” said
 Michael Yoshikami , chief investment strategist at YCMNet
Advisors. “It’s in writing from a lawmaker. It may not be over,
but it’s virtually a promise.” Dodd’s letter was reported
earlier today by Dow Jones Newswires.  
 Berkshire estimated in April that it may need to post $6
billion to $10 billion in collateral if the new rules were
applied to existing derivatives. Yesterday,  Jay Gelb , an analyst
with Barclays Plc said Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire may need
$6 billion to $8 billion in collateral. Gelb declined to comment
today.
