             U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, who
previously voted against a proposed U.S. regulatory overhaul,
plans to back the legislation, bringing Democrats closer to the
60 votes needed for it to pass, her spokesman said.  
 Cantwell, who opposed an earlier Senate bill because she
said it didn’t provide strong enough derivatives regulation, was
among four senators who remained uncommitted on a bill
negotiated last week. Her spokesman, John Diamond, disclosed her
intention in an e-mail today.  
 Senators Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Olympia Snowe of
Maine, both Republicans, have said they are still reviewing the
bill. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican who voted for
the initial Senate bill, hasn’t commented on how he will vote.
