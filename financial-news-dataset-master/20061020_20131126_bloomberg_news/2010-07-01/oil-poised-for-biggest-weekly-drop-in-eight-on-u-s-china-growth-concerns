             Crude oil was poised for its biggest
weekly drop in eight after declining on concern economic growth
in the U.S. and China will slow, curbing demand in the two
largest energy-consuming countries.  
 Oil dropped for a fourth day yesterday, the longest losing
streak in seven weeks, after U.S. manufacturing increased at a
slower pace last month and the Labor Department reported that
more Americans applied for jobless benefits last week. China’s
manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in June, adding
to signs the fastest-expanding major economy is cooling.  
 “We’ve had a whole lot of macro data from all around the
world suggesting that the prospects for economic growth aren’t
as strong as people were expecting,” said  Toby Hassall , a
commodity analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney. “Global
growth concerns feed through to prospects for fuel demand.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery traded at $72.91 a barrel,
down 4 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 9:54 a.m. Sydney time. Yesterday, the contract fell
$2.68 to $72.95, the lowest settlement price since June 8.
Futures are down 8.4 percent this year.  
 Oil is poised for a decline of 7.6 percent for the week,
the biggest drop since the week ended May 7. The market is in
its longest pullback since a six-day drop through May 18.
Futures lost 9.7 percent in the second quarter, the first
quarterly decline since 2008.  
 Jobless Claims  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s  gauge  of
manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier,
according to the Tempe, Arizona-based group. A reading greater
than 50 indicates expansion. Economists had forecast the measure
would fall to 59, according to the median of 81 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Brent crude for August delivery dropped 23 cents or 0.3
percent to $72.11 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Yesterday, it slipped $2.67, or 3.6
percent, to end the session at $72.34, also was the lowest
settlement since June 8.  
 U.S. initial jobless claims  increased  by 13,000 to 472,000
in the week ended June 26, the Labor Department said. Economists
forecast applications would fall to 455,000 from an initially
reported 457,000 for the prior week, according to the median of
46 projections in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The Labor Department today may report payrolls fell by
130,000 in June, reflecting cuts in temporary census workers as
the decennial survey nears completion, according to the median
estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Private
payrolls, which are more revealing of labor-market conditions,
probably rose by 110,000 after a 41,000 gain the prior month.  
 Rising Inventories  
 China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 52.1 from 53.9
in May, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. This missed a median 53.2
estimate from 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Oil prices also dropped yesterday because of rising fuel
inventories.  Gasoline inventories  rose 537,000 barrels to 218.1
million in the week ended June 25, according to an Energy
Department report yesterday. Supplies were forecast to decrease
by 400,000 barrels, based on a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  
 Tropical Storm Alex is losing power after coming ashore in
Mexico. The storm forced the shutdown of a quarter of the U.S.’s
Gulf of Mexico oil production. At its height, Alex reached
Category 2 status with winds of 100 miles (161 kilometers) an
hour marking the first June Atlantic hurricane since 1995.
