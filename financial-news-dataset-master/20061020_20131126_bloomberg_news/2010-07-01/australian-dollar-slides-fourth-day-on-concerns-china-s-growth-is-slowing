             The Aussie dollar slid for a fourth
day after a report showed China’s manufacturing expanded at a
slower pace for a second month in June, adding to signs that
growth is weakening in Australia’s biggest trading partner.  
 Australia’s currency fell to 83.79 U.S. cents as of 11:17
a.m. in Sydney from 84.08 cents yesterday in New York.
