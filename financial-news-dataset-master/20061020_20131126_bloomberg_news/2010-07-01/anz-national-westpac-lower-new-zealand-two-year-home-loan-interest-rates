             ANZ National Bank Ltd. and Westpac
Banking Corp. lowered their New Zealand two-year home loan
interest rates, responding to an earlier move by government-
owned rival Kiwibank.  
 ANZ lowered its rate to 7 percent from 7.3 percent while
the two other lenders set their rate at 6.99 percent, according
to their websites. ANZ also dropped its three-year rate to 7.3
percent from 7.75 percent.
