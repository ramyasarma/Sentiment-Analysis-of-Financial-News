             Mexico’s peso fell to the lowest
level in five weeks after a report showed contracts to purchase
previously owned homes in the U.S, the nation’s largest trading
partner, dropped my more than twice as forecast.  
 The currency plunged 0.9 percent to 13.0569 per dollar at
12:06 p.m. New York time, from 12.9409 yesterday. Earlier, the
peso reached 13.0760, the weakest since May 27.  
 “This kind of news reinforces the bears out there that
think global growth is going to be much slower, or it’s going to
be a double dip,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a currency
strategist with RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut.  
 The index of pending home sales dropped 30 percent from the
prior month, data from the National Association of Realtors
showed today. Initial jobless claims in the U.S. rose
unexpectedly to 472,000 in the week ending June 26, the Labor
Department said today.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.24 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.22 centavo to 124.65 centavos per peso.
