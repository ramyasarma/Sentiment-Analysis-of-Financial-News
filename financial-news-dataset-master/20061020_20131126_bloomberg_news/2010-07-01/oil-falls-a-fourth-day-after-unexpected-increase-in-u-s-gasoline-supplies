             Crude oil fell for a fourth day in
New York, the longest losing streak in seven weeks, amid concern
the economic recovery in the U.S. and China will slow and curb
demand in the world’s two largest energy consumers.  
 Oil slumped to its lowest in two weeks as Hurricane Alex
weakened to a Category 1 storm on its path over northeastern
Mexico and forecasters said it could be further downgraded to a
tropical storm by tomorrow. China’s manufacturing expanded at a
reduced pace for a second month in June, adding to signs the
fastest-growing major economy is cooling.  
 “The Chinese manufacturing index was disappointing and
adds to the whole array of bearish macro data and sour market
sentiment,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst with VTB
Capital in London. “With trading based purely on macro
developments, it looks like we could be heading for $72.”  
 Oil for August delivery fell as much as $1.42, or 1.9
percent, to $74.21 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest since June 14. It was at
$74.66 at 1:41 p.m. in London. Brent crude for August delivery
declined to $1 to $74.01 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London.  
 Futures in New York are down 5.9 percent this year and lost
11 percent in the second quarter. The market is in its longest
retreat since a six-day drop through May 18.  
 China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 52.1 from 53.9
in May, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in
an e-mailed statement. This missed a median 53.2 estimate from
12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Jobs Reports  
 U.S. companies in June added the smallest number of workers
since February, data from ADP Employer Services showed
yesterday. Private payrolls increased by 13,000, less than a
median estimate of 60,000 in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. A Labor Department report tomorrow will probably
show June payrolls fell.  
 “There are a lot of concerns about the pace of the U.S.
economic recovery,” said  David Moore , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “Sentiment is
still relatively cautious. Some of the U.S. data flow was on the
soft side of expectations.”  
 Gasoline inventories  rose 537,000 barrels to 218.1 million
in the week ended June 25, halting a seven-week gain, according
to an Energy Department report yesterday. Supplies, 3.5 percent
above the five-year average, were forecast to decrease by
400,000 barrels, based on a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  
 Fuel Demand Falls  
 Crude stockpiles fell 2 million barrels last week to 363.1
million, partly on reduced imports, the Energy Department said.
Distillate fuel inventories, including heating oil and diesel,
climbed 2.5 million barrels to 159.4 million. That’s the highest
in eight weeks.  
 U.S. fuel consumption  declined  2.7 percent to 19 million
barrels a day, the lowest since April, the report showed.  
 Alex, the earliest Atlantic hurricane since 1995, was
packing maximum sustained winds of 80 miles (130 kilometers) per
hour about 160 miles south-southwest of Brownsville, Texas, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said in  advisory  posted on its
website at 10 a.m. London time.  
 Eight rigs and 74 production platforms were evacuated
because of the hurricane, according to the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Almost 421,000
barrels a day of oil output were shut in, or 26 percent of Gulf
production, along with 919 million cubic feet of natural-gas
output, or 14 percent.  
 The center of the storm was about 600 miles from BP Plc’s
leaking Macondo oil well, the source of the worst oil spill in
U.S. history, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
