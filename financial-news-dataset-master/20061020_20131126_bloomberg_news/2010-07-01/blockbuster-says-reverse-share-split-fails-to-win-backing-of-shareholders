             Blockbuster Inc. , the money-losing
video-rental chain, said shareholders rejected a proposal for a
reverse split of the shares and that it expects to be delisted
from the New York Stock Exchange.  
 Fewer than half of the 289.9 million Class A and Class B
votes were in favor of a split, the company said today in a
 statement . Blockbuster, based in Dallas, said on June 24 that
shareholders had backed the plan.  
 Blockbuster, which has a debt payment due today, was
planning a reverse  split  of as much as 1-for-25 to boost its
stock price and meet NYSE listing requirements. The company had
also submitted a plan to the exchange to increase its market
capitalization to at least $75 million. Investors also rejected
a plan to consolidate the two classes of stock into one.  
 Regular trading of Blockbuster shares was halted. The stock
was last quoted at 23.1 cents, down about 1 cent. At current
prices, the company has a  market value  of $47.2 million.
