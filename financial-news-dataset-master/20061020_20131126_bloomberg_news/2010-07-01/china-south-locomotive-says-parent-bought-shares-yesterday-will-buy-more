             China South Locomotive and Rolling
Stock Corp. said its parent company bought 2 million of its
shares yesterday, according to a filing to Shanghai’s stock
exchange.  
 The company’s parent plans to spend up to 1 billion yuan
($147 million) during the next 12 months to increase its stake
in China South Locomotive by as much as 2 percent, according to
the statement. Yesterday’s purchase was part of that plan, the
company said.
