             President Barack Obama said his
administration will push for an overhaul of the nation’s
immigration laws, saying the system is “fundamentally broken.”  
 “This administration will not just kick the can down the
road. Immigration reform is no exception,” said Obama, speaking
at the American University School of International Service in
Washington.  
 Obama said diversity is a “powerful advantage” for the
U.S. in a global market and that immigrants have made the U.S.
the “engine” of world growth.  
 Obama has pledged to tighten border security and revamp the
nation’s immigration laws to deal with the millions of
immigrants in the country illegally. He repeated that pledge in
May during a state visit by Mexican President Felipe Calderon
and earlier this week in a meeting with immigration groups.  
 He met at the White House on June 29 with members of the
Hispanic Caucus to discuss immigration legislation and to thank
the lawmakers for their help in passing health-care and
economic-stimulus legislation, the White House said.
