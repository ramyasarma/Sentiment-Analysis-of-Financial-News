             Toyota Motor Corp.  and  Honda Motor
Co. , Japan’s two biggest carmakers, led the eleventh straight
increase in the nation’s monthly auto sales as government
incentives boosted demand.  
 Sales  of cars, trucks and buses, excluding minicars, rose
by 21 percent to 293,537 vehicles in June from a year earlier,
the  Japan Automobile Dealers Association  said in a statement in
Tokyo today. Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, sold 140,207
units, excluding Lexus-brand cars, an increase of 27 percent.  
 Japan’s auto sales began recovering from a yearlong slide
in August as government rebates and tax cuts for fuel-efficient
vehicles rekindled demand. The incentives helped raise sales by
about 600,000 vehicles last year and may increase them by about
900,000 this year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association said in December.  
 June sales rose 19 percent at Honda to 44,377 units, while
 Nissan Motor Co. , the nation’s third-largest automaker, sold
43,313 vehicles, a rise of 12 percent.  
 Toyota  shares fell 1.8 percent to 3,025 yen as of 2:19 p.m.
in Tokyo, while shares of  Honda  dropped 2.8 percent.  Nissan  fell
2.9 percent.  
 Under a government program started last June, consumers in
Japan can apply for a rebate of as much 250,000 yen ($2,747)
subsidy if they scrap a car more than 13 years old to buy a new
one, and 100,000 yen for a new car purchased without scrapping
an old one. The program expires at the end of September.  
 Electric, hybrid, natural-gas, and some diesel vehicles
also qualify for an exemption from the country’s weight and
purchase taxes.  
 Japan’s vehicle sales may fall 4.9 percent to 4.65 million
units for the fiscal year that began April 1 as the government
subsidy program’s expiration discourages buyers, according to
the automakers association.
