             The extra yield investors demand to
hold Treasury 10-year notes over 2-year debt fell to the lowest
level since October as employment, manufacturing and housing
reports heightened the risk of deflation.  
 The 10-year note  yield  stayed below 3 percent for a third
day after breaching that level this week for the first time in
more than a year. China’s manufacturing growth slowed in June,
while the Labor Department’s payrolls report tomorrow is
forecast by economists to show the U.S. lost jobs.  
 “Investors are moving out the curve in search of yield
with front-end rates so low,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-
rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of the 18
primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve. “Sentiment
is turning against the growth story. The market is awaiting
tomorrow’s number to see where to go from here.”  
 The difference between 10- and 2-year note debt, known as
the  yield curve , dropped for a fourth day to 2.32 percentage
points at 4:02 p.m. in New York, after earlier touching 2.28
percentage points, the lowest level since Oct. 2.  
 The narrowing spread indicates investor preference for
longer-term bonds, which tend to rise on slowing inflation. Two-
year yields tend to track the outlook for the Fed’s target rate
for overnight lending.  
 Yields on benchmark 10-year notes increased one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.95 percent, according to
BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.5 percent security
maturing in May 2020 dropped 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 104 22/32.  
 Two-Year Yield  
 The two-year  yield  advanced three basis points to 0.63
percent after touching a record low 0.5856 percent yesterday.
The 30-year yield was little changed at 3.89 percent.  
 U.S. employers cut 130,000 jobs last month, according to
the median forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
A lower-than-expected 431,000 new jobs in May included a 411,000
jump in government hiring of temporary workers for the 2010
census, the Labor Department said June 4. Tomorrow’s payrolls
report is due at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  
 Initial  jobless claims  climbed to 472,000 in the week ended
June 26 from a revised 459,000 in the previous week, the Labor
Department reported today. The median forecast of 46 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a decrease to 455,000 from a
previously reported 457,000.  
 “The weak jobless claims number is in line with what we
have been seeing: worsening economic condition and a global
slowing of the economy, which have been supportive of
Treasuries,” said  Larry Milstein , managing director of
government and agency debt trading in New York at R.W.
Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income broker and dealer for
institutional investors.  
 China’s Manufacturing  
 The Chinese government’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index 
declined for a second month in June, falling to 52.1 from 53.9
in the previous month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
 survey  of 12 economists was 53.2.  
 Two-year notes fell today as some investors bet that yields
may have dropped to levels not justified by the outlook for the
world’s largest economy.  
 Treasury investors should buy when prices dip, said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government bond strategist in Stamford,
Connecticut, at the primary dealer Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, in a research note.  
 “The market has a little of that ‘What the heck do we do
here?’ feel to it,” he wrote. “Trader bullishness is
historically excessive in bonds and a potentially significant
headwind for further price gains.”  
 Investors should enter trades that will profit from a rise
in Treasury yields because current levels are “well below”
fair value, according to Citigroup Inc.  
 ‘Double Dip’ View  
 “Concerns over a double dip are now overstated,”  Brett Rose , a New York-based fixed-income strategist at Citigroup,
wrote in a research report today.  
 The difference between  yields  on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of the inflation outlook
known as the break-even rate, has narrowed 0.18 percentage point
this week to 1.77 percentage points. It was 2.49 percentage
points on Jan. 11.  
 The U.S. Treasury will sell $12 billion in 10-year TIPS on
July 8. Inflation-indexed securities are intended to provide
investors with a hedge against inflation. The securities rise or
fall in value with movements in the government’s consumer price
index, with a three-month lag.  
 The CPI dropped 0.2 percent in May in the biggest decrease
since December 2008, the Labor Department reported June 17.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of
manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier,
the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. A reading greater
than 50 indicates  expansion .  
 Pending home resales decreased 30 percent in May from the
prior month, figures from the National Association of Realtors
showed. The drop was the biggest since at least 2001.
