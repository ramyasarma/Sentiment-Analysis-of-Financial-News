             France sold its 10-year government
bond at a record low yield today, according to data from Agence
France Tresor.  
 The 3.5 percent security maturing in April 2020 was sold at
a yield of 3.04 percent, the lowest since its records began, a
spokesman for the French debt agency said in an e-mail. The bond
drew bids 3.5 times the amount on offer.  
 The yield on the benchmark French 10-year bond fell three
basis points to 3.03 percent as of 10:34 a.m. in London. The 10-
year French yield fell to 2.831 percent on May 25, the lowest
since at least 1990, according to Bloomberg generic data.
