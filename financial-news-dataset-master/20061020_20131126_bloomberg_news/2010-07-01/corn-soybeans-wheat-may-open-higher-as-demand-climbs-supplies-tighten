             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report
yesterday showed U.S. farmers planted less than expected and
that inventories left from last year’s record harvest were below
estimates, said  Dax Wedemeyer , an analyst at U.S. Commodities
Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported
yesterday that domestic inventories on June 1 fell more than
analysts expected, Wedemeyer said. Soybean-meal futures may open
$1.50 to $2.50 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to fall 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound, he said.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on concern that adverse weather will reduce crops
in parts of Europe, Russia and Canada, Wedemeyer said.
