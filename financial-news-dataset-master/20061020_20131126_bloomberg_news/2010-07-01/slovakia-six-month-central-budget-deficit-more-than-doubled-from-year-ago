             Slovakia’s first-half central budget
 deficit  more than doubled from the same period last year to 2.44
billion euros ($2.98 billion) as job losses boosted social
spending and curbed tax income, the Finance Ministry said.  
 Revenue totaled 4.88 billion euros, trailing spending of
7.32 billion euros, the ministry in Bratislava said on its
 website  today. The six-month result compares with a gap 1.1
billion euros a year earlier.  
 The cumulative deficit represents 65 percent of the
projected full-year shortfall of 3.75 billion euros, according
to Bloomberg calculations. The export-driven  recovery , combined
with unemployment near a five-year high, has caused tax revenue
to stay short of the plan.  
 The Finance Ministry last month said the public-sector
deficit, which includes the welfare system and other state
entities, is set to reach 7 percent of gross domestic product
this year, compared with a plan of 5.5 percent.  
 The four political parties that are set to form a
government after winning majority in June 12 elections have said
fiscal consolidation is their top priority.
