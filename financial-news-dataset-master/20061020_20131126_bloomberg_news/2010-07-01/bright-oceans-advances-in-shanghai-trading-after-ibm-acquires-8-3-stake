             Bright Oceans Inter-Telecom Corp. , a
Chinese software maker, gained the most in four months in
Shanghai trading after  International Business Machines Corp. 
bought a stake in the company.  
 Bright Oceans increased  8.3 percent  to 9.43 yuan as of the
11:30 a.m. local time trading break, headed for the biggest one-
day gain since Feb. 22. China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite
Index  fell 0.1 percent.  
 IBM bought 5.92 million Bright Oceans shares from the
Beijing-based software company’s parent for 50 million yuan
($7.37 million) and said it wouldn’t sell the stake in the next
year, according to a filing to Shanghai’s stock exchange. Bright
Oceans wants to add strategic investors that can help bolster
its product development and increase its international exposure,
the company said in the statement.  
 The Chinese company’s  profit  last year gained 11.7 percent
to 82.4 million yuan from 2008 as sales grew 8.7 percent to 928
million yuan, according to Bright Oceans’ 2009 annual report.
Bright Oceans stock has fallen 8.6 percent this year, compared
with a 27 percent drop in the Shanghai Composite Index.  
 IBM in January of last year also bought a 1.56 percent
stake in Chinese television maker  Sichuan Changhong Electric Co. 
for 108 million yuan. In September 2006,  Intel Corp.  acquired a
$40 million stake in Chinese software maker  Neusoft Group Ltd.
