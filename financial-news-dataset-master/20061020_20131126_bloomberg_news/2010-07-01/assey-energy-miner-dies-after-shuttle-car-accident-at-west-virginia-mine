             Massey Energy Co. , owner of the mine
where 29 people were killed in an explosion in April, said a
miner died today after an accident at its Pocahontas operation
in West Virginia.  
 The accident at the mine in Greenbrier County involved a
shuttle car, and no other information was available,  Jeff Gillenwater , a spokesman for Richmond, Virginia-based Massey,
said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “Massey is saddened to confirm a fatal accident occurred
earlier today at its Pocahontas mine,” Gillenwater said.  
 The company produced 56,338 tons of coal at the operation
during the first quarter of this year, and extracted 84,239 tons
in 2009, according to data from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health
Administration.  
 Massey fell 71 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $26.64 as of 1:17
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 The company is under investigation because of the April 5
explosion at its Upper Big Branch mine in Montcoal, West
Virginia, the worst U.S. coal mining accident in 40 years. The
shares have fallen 51 percent since the fatal accident in April.
