             Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn 
purchased additional stock in Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.
after the close of his $7-a-share buyout bid, lifting his stake
in the independent film and TV studio to almost 38 percent.  
 Icahn, whose tender offer for the stock ended last night,
purchased 4.64 million shares today, according to a  filing . He
bought 6.22 million shares for $7 each over the past three days,
raising his total to 44.8 million.  
 The studio’s largest shareholder, Icahn, 74, is also trying
to gain control of Lions Gate’s board through a proxy fight. The
added stake may give him power to veto some decisions, including
proposed mergers and acquisitions requiring two-thirds approval
by shareholders, the company said in a March 12 filing.  
 “He effectively has blocking power,” said  Matthew Harrigan , a Denver-based analyst with Wunderlich Securities.  
 Lions Gate, distributor of the “Saw” horror films and
 Tyler Perry  comedies, rose 17 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $7.15 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .  
 Icahn said in an interview today he can’t buy any more
shares in the open market because of limits set by Canadian law.
Lions Gate, run from offices in Santa Monica, California, is
registered as a Canadian company with headquarters in Vancouver.
He declined to comment further.  
 Following Icahn’s purchases today, Lions Gate adopted a
shareholder rights plan triggered at 38 percent ownership. A so-
called permitted bid under the plan encourages acquisitions
supported by a majority of shareholders other than the acquirer,
according to a statement today.  
 Earlier, the company said a majority of shareholders
rejected Icahn’s takeover bid.  
 Potential Merger  
 One target of Icahn’s veto may be a possible union with
 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.  Lions Gate, which also produces the
Emmy-winning “Mad Men” TV series, has held talks with Los
Angeles-based MGM about a possible merger, a person familiar
with the situation said last week. No offer had been made, the
person said.  
 Icahn said in a June 28 interview that Lions Gate shouldn’t
consider such deals before lowering its own debt and overhead.  
 He said on June 11 that he planned to wage a proxy fight
for control of the board after the tender offer expired.
Management, and some shareholders, argued during the tender
period that his offer was too low.  
 “He’s trying to steal the company at a low price,”  John Kornitzer , whose Kornitzer Capital Management owns about 2
million shares, said in a June 29 interview. “He’s out there
acting like he’s our best friend. He’s not.”  
 Icahn said he purchased 2.43 million shares through the
extended tender offer that expired last night, after buying 15.6
million in the original offer ended June 16.  
 The studio established a $16 million trust in May to fund
severance payments for officers including Chief Executive  Jon Feltheimer   and Vice Chairman  Michael Burns  if they lose their
jobs without cause in a takeover, according to the filing.
