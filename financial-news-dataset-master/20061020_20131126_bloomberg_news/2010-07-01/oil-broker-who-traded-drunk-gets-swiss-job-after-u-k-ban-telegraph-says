             Former PVM Oil Futures Ltd. broker
 Steve Perkins  will resume his trading career in Switzerland
after being banned from working in the U.K., the Daily Telegraph
said, without citing where it got the information.  
 Perkins met yesterday with commodity brokers Starsupply
Renewables SA, the Telegraph said. On June 29, he was fined
72,000 pounds ($108,000) and prohibited from trading for five
years by the U.K. Financial Services Authority for trading $520
million in oil futures while drunk, the newspaper said.  
 The FSA knew that Perkins was seeking a job in Switzerland
and told Swiss regulators about his move, the Telegraph said.
The regulator said it couldn’t prevent him from trading in
Europe, the newspaper said.
