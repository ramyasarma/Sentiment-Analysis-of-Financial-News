             Spain’s  IBEX 35 Index  slumped to its
lowest level since June 10, falling 229.1, or 2.5 percent, to
9034.3 at 9:51 a.m. in Madrid, as all 35 members declined.  
 The following are among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market today.  
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA  (BBVA SM) fell 35 cents,
or 4 percent, to 8.26 euros and  Banco Santander SA  (SAN SM)
dropped 34 cents, or 3.9 percent, to 8.40 euros. Spain’s top
credit ranking was placed on review for a possible downgrade by
Moody’s Investors Service.  
 Telefonica SA  (TEF SM) dropped 1.6 percent to 15.02 euros,
erasing yesterday’s 1 percent rise. The company extended its
billion-euro offer for Portugal Telecom SGPS SA’s stake in
Brazil’s largest wireless operator until July 16 on optimism the
European Union will void Portugal’s power of veto.
