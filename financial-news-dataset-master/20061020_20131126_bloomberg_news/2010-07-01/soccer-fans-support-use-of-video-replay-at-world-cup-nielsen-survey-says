             A global survey of soccer fans
supports recent calls for the use of video replays to help World
Cup officials after two controversial decisions during the
current competition, according to a Nielsen Co. survey.  
 Sixty-five percent of respondents to a Nielsen online
survey said they were in favor of replays at the World Cup,
while only about one in 10 people supported keeping the ban on
them. The rest had no opinion on the matter, Nielsen said in a
statement.  
 The call for replays has increased after two incidents in
World Cup elimination games on June 27.  
 England’s  Frank Lampard  had a goal disallowed in a 4-1 loss
to Germany, even though television replays showed the ball went
over the goal line. Replays also showed Argentina’s  Carlos Tevez 
was offside when he scored in a 3-1 win over Mexico.  
 While sports including tennis, rugby and cricket use
replays and other devices to aid decision-making, soccer has
resisted adopting the technology.  Sepp Blatter , president of
world governing body FIFA, said two days ago the group would
reconsider the matter at a meeting later this month.  
 The survey of more than 27,000 people in 55 countries,
conducted from March 8 to 26, had a margin of error of plus or
minus 0.6 percentage point.
