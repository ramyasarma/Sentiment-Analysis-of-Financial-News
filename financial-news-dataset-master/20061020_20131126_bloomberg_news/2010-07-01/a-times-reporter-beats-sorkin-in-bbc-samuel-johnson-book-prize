             Barbara Demick ’s “Nothing to Envy:
Real Lives in North Korea” won the  BBC Samuel Johnson Prize ,
defeating  Andrew Ross Sorkin’s  “Too Big to Fail” and four
other finalists for the annual U.K. nonfiction award, worth
20,000 pounds ($30,000).  
 Demick, a foreign correspondent for the Los Angeles Times,
was honored in a ceremony at the  Royal Institute of British
Architects  for her account of six ordinary North Koreans who
struggle to survive inside the hermetic land of  Kim Jong Il .  
 The contest organizers praised “Nothing to Envy”
(Granta/Spiegel & Grau) for creating what they called an
unforgettable look at a country where even “Gone With the
Wind” is considered dangerous literature.  
 “It is the personal detail in ‘Nothing to Envy’ that
makes it both gripping and moving,” said the chairman of the
judging panel, economist and Radio 4 presenter  Evan Davis , in
an e-mailed statement.  
 “Nowhere will you find a better account of real life in
North Korea, a society that is all too easily comically
typecast by massive parades of co-ordinated flag-wavers.”  
 Each runner-up, including Sorkin for “Too Big to Fail”
( Allen Lane /Viking), receives 1,000 pounds. The other finalists
were “Alex’s Adventures in Numberland” by Alex Bellos
( Bloomsbury ); “Blood Knots” by Luke Jennings ( Atlantic ); “A
Gambling Man” by Jenny Uglow ( Faber ); and “Catching Fire: How
Cooking Made Us Human” by Richard Wrangham (Profile/Basic).  
 First granted in 1999, the Samuel Johnson Prize is billed
as the U.K.’s richest award for the genre and is sponsored by
the British Broadcasting Corp.
