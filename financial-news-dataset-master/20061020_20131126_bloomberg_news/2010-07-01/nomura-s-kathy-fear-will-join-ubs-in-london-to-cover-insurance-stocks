             Kathy Fear , an insurance analyst who
left Morgan Stanley last year to join  Nomura Holdings Inc. , will
start working  for UBS AG  in August.  
 Fear will continue to cover insurance stocks after her move
to the London unit of Switzerland’s largest bank, according to
UBS spokesman  Dominik von Arx . The analyst joins UBS after less
than a year with Japan’s biggest securities firm, and left the
company “some weeks ago,” Nomura spokeswoman  Felicity Albert 
said by phone yesterday.  
 Fear was one of five equity analysts in Europe Nomura hired
in October 2009 to cover European and emerging-market companies.
