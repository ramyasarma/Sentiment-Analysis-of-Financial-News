             At least 35 people were killed and
175 were injured in twin suicide bombings at a Sufi shrine in
Pakistan’s eastern city of Lahore.  
 “The bombings took place when the shrine was crowded with
worshippers who usually visit on Thursday night,” Khusro
Pervez, the commissioner of Lahore, told reporters. The heads of
both the bombers were found, he said.
