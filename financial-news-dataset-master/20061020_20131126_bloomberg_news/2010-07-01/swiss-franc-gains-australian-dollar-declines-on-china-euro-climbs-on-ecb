             The dollar tumbled to a seven-month
low against the yen on speculation the world’s largest economy
may be slow to recover, while the euro climbed amid signs that
funding pressures are easing on Europe’s financial institutions.  
 The greenback fell as data showed U.S. manufacturing
weakened and economists forecast a report tomorrow will say
payrolls shrank. The euro rose the most since May 10 after the
European Central Bank said it was lending 111.2 billion euros
($136.5 billion) for six days to help banks cope with a landmark
loan’s expiration and Spain sold bonds a day after Moody’s
Investors Service said it may cut the nation’s credit rating.  
 “People are still pretty risk averse,” said  Amelia Bourdeau , a currency strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at UBS
AG. “The market is nervous about tomorrow’s private-payroll
number because recent U.S. releases have been disappointing.”  
 The dollar dropped 0.9 percent against the yen to 87.60 at
5 p.m. in New York. It touched 86.97 yen, its weakest level
since Dec. 2. The Swiss franc strengthened as much as 0.8
percent to a record 1.3074 per euro before trading at 1.3267.  
 The euro surged as much as 2.5 percent to $1.2540, from
$1.2238 yesterday, before trading at $1.2527. It was the biggest
gain on an intraday basis since May 10, when European leaders
announced an almost $1 trillion package to support debt-laden
governments and shore up the shared currency. The euro gained
1.4 percent to 109.74 yen, from 108.22.  
 U.S. Payrolls  
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls tumbled by 130,000 in June, the first
drop this year, according to the median estimated in a Bloomberg
News survey of 82 economists before the Labor Department reports
the data tomorrow. Non-government payrolls increased by 110,000
jobs, according to a separate survey, from 41,000 in May, when
they were forecast to swell by 180,000.  
 The euro strengthened for a second day against the dollar
as the ECB said 78 banks asked for six-day funds at the
benchmark interest rate of 1 percent. European banks needed to
repay 442 billion euros in 12-month loans today, the biggest
amount the central bank ever awarded and a major part of its
effort to contain the financial crisis last year.  
 Banks asked for 131.9 billion euros in three-month loans
yesterday, less than economists expected.  
 Today’s allotment “is a reasonably big number,” said
 Laurent Bilke , an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London.
“Together with yesterday’s operation, the funding needs come in
on the high side of estimates. However, the banks that are
overly reliant on the ECB are on the periphery of Europe, it’s
not stress across the board.”  
 German two-year notes slid on speculation a decline in the
amount financial institutions are borrowing from the ECB heralds
higher interest rates. The yield touched 0.71 percent, the
highest level since May 10.  
 Spanish Auction  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros of five-year bonds at an
auction today. The notes drew an average yield of 3.657 percent,
compared with 3.532 percent at the previous sale on May 6.
Demand was 1.7 times the amount sold, compared with a bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.35 at the May sale.  
 Moody’s yesterday cited “deteriorating” growth prospects
and challenges in meeting fiscal targets as it said Spain’s Aaa
classification may be lowered by as much as two grades.  
 “The euro has had a brighter day,” said  Vassili Serebriakov , a currency strategist at Wells Fargo & Co. in New
York. “It has been able to detach itself to an extent from
those market jitters on the back of the Spanish debt auction.”  
 U.S. Manufacturing  
 A gauge of U.S.  manufacturing  fell to 56.2 in June from
59.7 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for
Supply Management said today. A reading greater than 50 signals
expansion. Economists forecast it would decline to 59, according
to the median in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Initial  claims  for U.S. unemployment benefits increased by
13,000 to 472,000 in the week ended June 26, U.S. Labor
Department data showed. Economists in another Bloomberg survey
forecast a fall to 455,000.  
 The number of  contracts  to purchase previously owned houses
in the U.S. plunged in May by 30 percent, more than twice as
much as forecast, after a homebuyer tax credit expired, data
from the National Association of Realtors showed today.  
 China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index showed manufacturing
expanded less than forecast in June and Australian building
approvals unexpectedly slid.  
 Mexico’s peso fell to the lowest level since May 27 on
global economic reports. The peso declined 0.5 percent to
13.0090 per dollar after touching 13.0824.  
 “People are concerned that not many economies in the world
are going to be sustainable after stimulus measures expire,”
said  Susumu Kato , chief economist in Tokyo at Credit Agricole
CIB and CLSA, a unit of France’s largest bank by branches. “The
bias is for the yen to be bought.”  
 The yen typically strengthens in times of financial turmoil
as Japan’s trade surplus means the nation does not have to rely
on overseas lenders.
