             Mortgage rates  on 30-year U.S. loans
slid to a record low for the second straight week, lowering
borrowing costs for homebuyers as demand slumps.  
 Rates for 30-year fixed loans sank to 4.58 percent in the
week ended today from 4.69 percent last week, Freddie Mac said
in a statement. The average 15-year  rate  fell to 4.04 percent,
also a new low, the McLean, Virginia-based company said.  
 The decline in mortgage rates, fueled by investor demand
for government-supported bonds tied to housing loans, has failed
to lift U.S. home sales after the April 30 end of a federal tax
credit for buyers. Purchases are more dependent on consumer
confidence and employment than rates, said  Cameron Findlay ,
chief economist at Lendingtree.com in Irvine, California.  
 The housing market “is not a rate discussion these days,”
he said. “If you have an improvement in jobs, people have more
disposable income and that will improve home sales.”  
 Confidence among U.S. consumers fell in June more than
forecast as Americans became distressed over the outlook for
jobs. The Conference Board’s confidence index declined to 52.9
last month from a revised 62.7 in May, according to a June 29
report. The  unemployment rate  was at 9.7 percent in May,
compared with a 26-year high of 10.1 percent in October.  
 Home Sales Drop  
 The number of contracts to buy previously owned homes
plunged 30 percent in May from the prior month, the biggest
decline in records dating to 2001, the National Association of
Realtors said today. The report followed Commerce Department
data last week showing a 33 percent slide in new home purchases.  
 The tax credit, worth as much as $8,000, helped fuel a
rebound in demand last year and was extended and expanded in
November. The credit required buyers to sign contracts by the
end of April and close by June 30. The House of Representatives
voted this week to push the deadline for closing to Sept. 30.  
 Mortgage rates have been declining since May as concern
that a European debt crisis may spread pushed investors to the
safety of Treasuries and government-supported bonds tied to home
loans.  Yields  on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage securities
have fallen to the lowest level in more than a year.  
 The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of U.S. mortgage
applications jumped 8.8 percent for the week ended June 25. The
Washington group’s refinancing gauge climbed 13 percent to the
highest level since May 2009, and purchases declined 3.3 percent
to the second-lowest level since 1997.
