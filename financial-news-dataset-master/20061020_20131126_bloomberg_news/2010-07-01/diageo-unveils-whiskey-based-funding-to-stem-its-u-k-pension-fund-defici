             Diageo Plc , the maker of Smirnoff
vodka and Guinness stout, said it formulated a funding plan to
address an 862 million-pound ($1.3 billion) deficit in its U.K.
pension fund that will use maturing whiskey as collateral.  
 The spirit will be held by a funding partnership with the
pension trustee, generating 25 million pounds of income annually
for the 15-year term of the agreement, the distiller said today
in a statement. Once the 15 years is up, the trustee will be
able to sell its interest in the partnership to Diageo for an
amount not exceeding 430 million pounds.  
 Diageo also said it released 197 million pounds to the U.K.
fund and agreed to pay as much as 338 million pounds toward the
deficit if it doesn’t shrink by an equivalent amount in 10
years. The distiller will increase contributions toward its
Irish pension scheme by about 21 million euros a year.  
 The company said it sees the payments as “broadly cash-
flow neutral” against the 50 million pounds per annum it has
paid in respect of the U.K. pension fund since 2007.  
 Diageo  shares  slid as much as 1.1 percent in London trading
and were down 7 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 1,053 pence at 9 a.m.
