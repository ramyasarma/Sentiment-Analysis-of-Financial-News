             Retail sales  in Germany rose in May
as the economic recovery gathered pace and  unemployment  fell.  
 Sales , adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings,
increased 0.4 percent from April, when they dropped 0.5 percent,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. May’s
gain was in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
 survey  of 17 economists. In the year, sales declined 2.4
percent.  
 German companies are stepping up  output  and increasing
their workforce as an Asian-led global recovery boosts export
orders, in turn encouraging consumer demand. The Bundesbank last
month raised its growth forecasts for Europe’s largest economy,
predicting it will expand 1.9 percent this year and 1.4 percent
in 2011.  
 Food, drink and tobacco sales fell 5.3 percent in May from
the same month in 2009, which had one more working day, today’s
report showed. Sales of non-foodstuffs rose 0.1 percent.  
 Consumer confidence  in Germany will hold steady this month
as a drop in unemployment and the soccer World Cup encourage
spending, Nuremberg-based market research company GfK AG said
last week.
