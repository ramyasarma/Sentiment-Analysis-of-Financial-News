             Blackstone Group LP  will invest 2.75
billion rupees ($59 million) to buy a 12.5 percent stake in
India’s Monnet Power Co., the world’s biggest private-equity
firm said in a statement today.  
 Monnet Power, a unit of sponge-iron maker  Monnet Ispat and
Energy Ltd ., is building a 1,050 megawatt coal-based power plant
backed by pit-head mines in the eastern Indian state of Orissa.
Monnet Power is building an additional 2,000 megawatts of power
generation capacity, the statement said.  
 “Monnet Power with its mine mouth coal plant has one of
the lowest costs of producing power,” said  Akhil Gupta ,
Blackstone’s India chairman, in the statement.  
 Demand for power is expected to rise as Asia’s third-
largest economy is poised to grow 8.5 percent in the financial
year ending March 2011. India faced a 9.8 percent shortfall in
power generation between April and December last year, according
to a finance ministry document.  
 Blackstone  shares  fell 2.4 percent to $9.33 as of 10:52 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Monnet Ispat rose
0.1 percent to 402.80 rupees at close of trading in Mumbai.
