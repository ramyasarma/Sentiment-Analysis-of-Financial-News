             BP Plc is “slightly ahead of
schedule” in drilling relief wells to permanently stop the flow
of oil from a leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. National
Incident Commander Thad Allen said.  
 Allen said the target is still mid-August for completing
the “bottom kill” effort. “I’d rather under-promise and over-
deliver,” he said at a White House briefing today.
