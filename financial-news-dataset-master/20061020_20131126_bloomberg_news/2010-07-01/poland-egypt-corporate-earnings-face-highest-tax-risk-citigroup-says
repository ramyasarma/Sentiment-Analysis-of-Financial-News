             Poland and Egypt are more at risk
from higher taxes in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Africa as governments tackle deficits, according to
Citigroup Inc.  
 “We see tax risk as higher in countries where the deficit
needs to come down and corporate taxes are below average,”
Citigroup strategist  Andrew Howell  wrote in a report distributed
today. South Africa and Russia are also “at risk,” while
Turkey “looks in relatively better shape,” he wrote.  
 Bank levies “could be implemented in a Europe-wide
manner,” and the CEEMEA mining industry “looks under-taxed
relative to global peers,” according to Citigroup.
