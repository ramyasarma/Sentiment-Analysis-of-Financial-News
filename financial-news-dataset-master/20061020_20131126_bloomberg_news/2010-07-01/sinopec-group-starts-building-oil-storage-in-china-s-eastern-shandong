             China Petrochemical Corp. , Asia’s
largest oil refiner, started building a stockpile base at
Shandong with capacity to hold 3.2 million cubic meters of oil.  
 The facility at Rizhao city in the eastern Shandong
province will be among eight storage plants the company, known
as Sinopec Group, plans to build nationwide to cope with
volatile global crude oil prices, it said in an online  video
clip . Construction will finish by end-November, it said, without
saying when operations will start.  
 China, the world’s second-biggest energy consumer, is
adding commercial and strategic oil reserve bases to manage the
nation’s growing reliance on imports for its energy needs. More
than half China’s crude-oil requirements last year came from
abroad, government officials have said.  
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. , Sinopec Group’s Hong
Kong-listed unit, started building in May a 3.2 million cubic-
meter oil storage facility at the eastern port city of Tianjin,
according to Xinhua News Agency. The Tianjin base is among the
eight in Sinopec Group’s plans, according to the report today.
