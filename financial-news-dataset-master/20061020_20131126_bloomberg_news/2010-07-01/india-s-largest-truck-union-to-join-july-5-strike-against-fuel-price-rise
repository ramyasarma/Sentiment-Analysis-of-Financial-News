             The All India Motor Transport
Congress, a grouping of 7,000 transport companies, will join a
nationwide strike called by opposition parties on July 5 to
protest a rise in fuel prices.  
 “Our customers will find it difficult to pay increased
freight rentals if we pass on the cost to them,” G.R.
Shanmugappa, president of the largest truckers’ union, said in a
phone interview. “We want the government to roll back the
diesel price hike.”  
 Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government on June 25
allowed state refiners to raise prices of gasoline by about 3.5
rupees (8 cents) a liter and that of diesel by 2 rupees, as it
sought to cut subsidies and trim the budget deficit from a 16-
year high. Gasoline has been freed fully from government
controls, while diesel prices will eventually be market-
determined.  
 The truckers have yet to pass on the increased cost to
their customers, said Shanmugappa. The union will decide on
future action after a meeting on July 12, he said.  
 As many as 10 opposition parties, including the Bharatiya
Janata Party, the  Communist Party of India (Marxist)  and the
regional Telugu Desam Party, have called for stoppages on July 5.
