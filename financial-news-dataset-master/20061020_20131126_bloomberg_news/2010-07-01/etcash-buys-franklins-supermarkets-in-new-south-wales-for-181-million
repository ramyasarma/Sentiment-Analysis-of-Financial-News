             Metcash Ltd. , Australia’s biggest
grocery wholesaler, agreed to buy the Franklins supermarket
chain for A$215 million ($181 million), adding 85 stores in the
state of New South Wales.  
 The acquisition will add more than A$500 million in
wholesale revenue a year, Metcash said in a statement to the
exchange today. Wholesale sales in the year ended April 30 rose
4.9 percent to A$11.5 billion, Metcash said in June.  
 The  takeover  is Metcash’s first since agreeing in December
to buy control of home-improvement retailer Mitre 10 Group,
according to Bloomberg data. Metcash will sell the Franklins
outlets to independent retailers, increasing the proportion of
stores supplied by the wholesaler in New South Wales to 17
percent from 11 percent, it said.  
 “These stores will be able to take advantage of our
favorable arrangements with suppliers to achieve more
competitive pricing deals,” Metcash Chief Executive Officer
 Andrew Reitzer  said in the statement. The company will pay for
the Franklins supermarkets with existing bank loans, it said.  
 Metcash gained 3.3 percent to A$4.33 at 11:03 a.m. in
Sydney trading. The stock has dropped 3.1 percent this year.
