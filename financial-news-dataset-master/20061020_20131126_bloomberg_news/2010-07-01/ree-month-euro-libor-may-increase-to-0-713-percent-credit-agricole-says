             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros may rise today, according to Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may climb to 0.713 percent, said Peter Chatwell, a fixed-income
strategist in London. The rate was 0.706 percent yesterday, data
from the British Bankers’ Association
showed.  
 Libor for three-month dollars may stay at 0.534 percent,
Chatwell said.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans may slip to 0.764 percent, he said. The rate was
0.767 percent yesterday, according to the European Banking
Federation.
