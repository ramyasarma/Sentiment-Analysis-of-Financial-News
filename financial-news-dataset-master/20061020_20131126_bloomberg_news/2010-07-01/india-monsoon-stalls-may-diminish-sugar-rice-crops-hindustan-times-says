             India’s progress of the monsoons has
stalled, which may affect sugar and rice crops in the northern
states, the Hindustan Times reported, citing an unidentified
official in the weather office.  
 The monsoon, 21 percent deficient in the week to June 23,
is unlikely to progress to India rice-growing areas before July
4, according to the report.
