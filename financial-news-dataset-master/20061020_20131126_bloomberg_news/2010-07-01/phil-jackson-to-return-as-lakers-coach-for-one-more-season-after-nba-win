             Phil Jackson  says he’ll return for
one more season as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.  
 Jackson, who won his record 11th National Basketball
Association championship with the Lakers this past season, said
in a statement released today by the team that the 2010-11
campaign will be his “last stand.”  
 The 64-year-old coach’s return was a question all season,
with team owner  Jerry Buss  wanting him to take a pay cut and
Jackson considering retirement. Jackson made $12 million during
the 2009-10 season, when the Lakers won a second straight title.
The team didn’t say how much he’ll make next season.  
 “Count me in,” said Jackson, whose girlfriend, Jeanie
Buss, is a Lakers executive and Jerry Buss’s daughter. “After a
couple weeks of deliberation, it is time to get back to the
challenge of putting together a team that can defend its title.
It’ll be the last stand for me, and I hope a grand one.”  
 Jackson will be seeking to win a title in three straight
seasons for the fourth time in his 19-year coaching career.  
 As coach of the Chicago Bulls from 1989 through 1998, the
team led by  Michael Jordan  and  Scottie Pippen  twice managed
three-year title streaks. Jackson joined the Lakers in 1999 and
won three straight titles from 2000 through 2002 behind
 Shaquille O’Neal  and  Kobe Bryant .  
 The Lakers beat the Orlando Magic and Boston Celtics in the
NBA Finals the past two years.  
 ‘The Best Coach’  
 “We’ve now won five titles in the 10 years he’s been our
head coach and have been to the Finals in seven of those 10
years, which is amazing,” said Lakers General Manager  Mitch Kupchak . “He’s not only the best coach for this team, but quite
simply the best coach in the history of the NBA.”  
 Jackson, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame
in 2007, has 1,098 wins and 460 losses in his coaching career.
His .705 winning percentage is the best in NBA history, and his
win total ranks fifth. His 225 playoff victories are the most of
any coach.
