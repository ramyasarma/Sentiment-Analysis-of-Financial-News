             The euro strengthened as the European
Central Bank said a six-day refinancing operation would help
smooth the effects of an expiring 12-month tender, easing
pressure on the region’s banks to finance their activities.  
 The single currency erased earlier declines to advance
versus all but two of its 16 major counterparts before the ECB
offers unlimited loans at a fixed rate of 1 percent today. Banks
need to repay 442 billion euros ($543 billion) in 12-month
funds, a key component in the central bank’s efforts to fight
the financial crisis last year. The ECB said yesterday it would
lend banks 131.9 billion euros for three months, a smaller
amount than some analysts estimated.  
 “Sentiment has improved after the relatively small
takedown at yesterday’s long-term refinancing operation,” said
 Paul Robinson , a currency strategist at Barclays Plc in London.
“The funding operations are key to the euro at the moment.”  
 The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.22986 as of 9:50 a.m. in
London. It gained 0.3 percent to 108.53 yen.
