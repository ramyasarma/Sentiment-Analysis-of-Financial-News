             Brazil’s longest fixed-rate bonds had
their biggest rally in three months in June as inflation eased,
bolstering a government bid to make the notes a benchmark
security after it canceled three of the past nine auctions.  
 Yields on the real-denominated bonds due in 2021 fell 24
basis points last month to 12.34 percent as central bank
President  Henrique Meirelles  raised the main overnight rate for
the second time since April to cool the fastest expansion in 15
years. The decline cut the yield difference between the 2021
bonds and notes maturing in 2011 to 98 basis points on June 28,
the smallest since the government first issued the long bonds in
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The rally will aid the Treasury’s effort to turn the
maturity into a bond that establishes the cost of borrowing and
reduces the country’s dependence on short-term debt, said  Paolo Valle , who helps oversee more than $1 billion of emerging-market
assets with Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. Government  sales 
of the notes rose 22 percent last month to 990 million reais
($549.5 million) after plunging 70 percent in May as Europe’s
debt crisis eroded demand for less-traded securities.  
 “We should not conclude that their long-term plans have
been hindered; not at all,” Valle said in a telephone
interview. “They will achieve those plans” to make the bond a
benchmark, he said.  
 The government extended the average maturity on its debt to
3.6 years in April from 2.9 years in 2004, according to the
Treasury. The amount of debt maturing in the next 12 months
dropped to 25 percent from 39 percent in 2004.  
 Further Declines  
 There was 8.7 billion reais of the 2021 bonds outstanding
in April, less than 25 percent of the 37 billion-real average
for the government’s six other fixed-rate notes, according to
the Treasury. Brazil sold 150 million reais of the bonds
yesterday, or 50 percent of the amount offered, to yield 12.35
percent.  
 The Treasury needs to issue about 40 billion reais of the
maturity -- in line with the size of its 2017 bonds -- to make
it a benchmark, said  Virgilio Castro Cunha , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Corp. in Sao Paulo. Such a bond
helps create yield spread comparisons that determine borrowing
expenses.  
 Fernando Garrido , the debt operations coordinator at the
Treasury, said the 2021 bonds are liquid enough to be considered
a standard bond. He said the government doesn’t have plans to
speed up issuance of the securities after the rally. Yields will
keep dropping, he predicted.  
 “We believe in the narrowing of yield premiums in the
future,” Garrido said in a telephone interview from Brasilia.  
 ‘Positive Momentum’  
 Meirelles has lifted the overnight lending rate 1.5
percentage points since April from a record low of 8.75 percent
to contain inflation after the economy expanded nine percent in
the first quarter, the most since 1995.  
 Inflation eased to 5.2 percent in May from 5.3 percent in
April. The government targets an annual rate of 4.5 percent.
Economists cut their year-end inflation forecast to 5.6 percent
from 5.7 percent in May, according to the median estimate in a
central bank survey published June 28. The central bank
yesterday forecast consumer prices will rise 5.4 percent this
year as the economy expands 7.3 percent.  
 “The central bank has credibility with the markets,”
Valle said in a telephone interview. “The indication is that
they will continue tightening into next year. That’s what’s
creating this positive momentum in the long end.”  
 The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
July 2011 declined nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point,
to 11.78 percent at 6:27 p.m. New York time, indicating traders
expect policy makers to raise the overnight rate to about 12.5
percent by then.  
 Foreign Buyers  
 Yields on the 2021 bonds, known as NTN-Fs, have dropped 92
basis points from the May 7 peak of 13.2 percent to 12.3 percent
today as foreign investors returned to the market after pulling
back following credit-rating downgrades in Greece, Spain and
Portugal. Foreigners owned 49 percent of the 2021 bonds and 61
percent of fixed-rate bonds due in 2017 as of April, according
to the Treasury.  
 “The back end of the local curve in Brazil is mostly
determined by international players,” Bank of America’s Cunha
said in a telephone interview. “It really shows you that
international investors today see Brazil at least on a relative
basis as being in a much sounder position.”  
 The average  monthly yield  on the auctions of 2021 debt fell
to 12.47 percent in June from 12.72 percent in May and 12.84
percent in March, according to the Treasury.  
 The  extra yield  investors demand to own Brazilian
government dollar bonds instead of Treasuries widened two basis
points to 250. The spread widened 16 basis points in June.  
 Canceled Sales  
 The cost of protecting Brazilian debt against non-payment
for five years with credit-default swaps rose four basis points
today to 142 basis points, according to data compiled by CMA
DataVision. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a government or company fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  
 The real rose 0.8 percent to 1.7911 per dollar, paring its
loss this year to 2.6 percent.  
 Sales of the 2021 bonds are picking up after the government
canceled  auctions  three times in May and June. The  Treasury 
received no bids it found acceptable for the bonds on May 6, May
27 and June 1.  
 “If the world changes, they change their strategy,” Cunha
said. “They don’t want to be too aggressive in selling these
bonds cheaper than they think they could.”
