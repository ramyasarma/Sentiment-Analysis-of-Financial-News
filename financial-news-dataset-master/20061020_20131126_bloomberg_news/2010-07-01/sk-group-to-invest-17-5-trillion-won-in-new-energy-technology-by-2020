             SK Group , which accounts for almost
10 percent of South Korea’s total output, plans to invest 17.5
trillion won ($14.3 billion) by 2020 in alternative energy and
new technology to find future sources of income.  
 SK will spend 4.5 trillion won on new energy including
solar cell and biofuels, 4.2 trillion won on environmental
infrastructure such as smart grids and water treatment plants
and 8.8 trillion won on new technology, the Seoul-based group
said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 The group, which has 77 units including  SK Energy Co.  and
 SK Telecom Co. , is hoping to benefit from growing demand for
alternative energy as companies seek to pollute less and reduce
their dependence on oil. The investment will create 42,000 jobs
by 2020, the company said.  
 The parent company of South Korea’s largest crude refiner
will also increase investment in natural resources, boosting oil
and gas reserves from its own fields to 1 billion barrels by
2015 from the current 520 million barrels.  
 South Korea’s third-largest conglomerate launched SK China
in Beijing today, consolidating all SK units in China to
strengthen marketing and sales, according to the statement.
