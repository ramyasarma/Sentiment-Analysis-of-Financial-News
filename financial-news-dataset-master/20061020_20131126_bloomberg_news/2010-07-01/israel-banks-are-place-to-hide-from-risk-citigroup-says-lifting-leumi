             Israeli banks are “a place to hide”
from risk, Citigroup Inc. said as it raised its recommendation
for  Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd.  to “buy,” citing economic growth
and share price declines.  
 “For the risk-averse looking for a place to hide,”
investors should take advantage of Israeli banks, analysts
 Michael Klahr  and  Simon Nellis  wrote in a note to investors.
“Israel avoided recession in 2009 due to its robust financial
sector, monetary easing/negative real rates, a strong fiscal
response and strong high-tech exports.”  
 Israel’s rebound from the global financial crisis has been
powered by exports, which make up almost 50 percent of gross
domestic product. Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said
on June 18 the bank expects economic growth of 3.7 percent this
year. Israel’s economy expanded an annualized 3.6 percent in the
first quarter.  
 The shares of Leumi, the country’s largest bank, plunged 20
percent in the second quarter, while  Bank Hapoalim Ltd. , the
second-largest,  fell 14 percent  and  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. ,
the number three, slumped 22 percent in the period. Israel’s
benchmark index lost 14 percent and the MSCI World Index, which
tracks more than 1,600 stocks, was down 13 percent.  
 Citigroup  increased Leumi  from “hold” and lifted the share
price estimate 11 percent to 17.5 shekels. The shares were
unchanged at 13.91 shekels at 12:41 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  
 Hapoalim and Discount had their price estimates cut 1.7
percent and 12 percent to 17.2 shekels and 8.5 shekels,
respectively. The analysts cited a lower sustainable  return on
equity .  
 Hapoalim fell 1.4 percent to 13.87 shekels and Discount
lost 2 percent to 6.455 shekels.
