             South Africa’s rand extended a drop
against the dollar after a report which showed the country’s
manufacturing industry may have contracted for the first time in
eight months in June.  
 The rand lost as much as 1.1 percent to 7.7432 per dollar,
the weakest intraday level since June 11, where it was trading
as of 11:18 a.m. in Johannesburg. It was trading at 7.7041
before the report was released.  
 South Africa’s purchasing managers’ index fell to 48.4 in
June from 51.1 in May, its first drop below 50 in eight months,
Kagiso Securities Ltd. said.
