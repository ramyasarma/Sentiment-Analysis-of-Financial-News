             Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  is
expected to fully recover from surgery to remove a blood clot on
the outside of his brain, the  Standard  reported, citing the
surgeon who operated on him, David Livingstone Oluoch-Olunya.  
 Doctors advised Odinga, who was diagnosed with a medical
condition known as chronic subdural haematoma, to remain in
hospital for five days and then continue to get plenty of rest,
the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today.  
 Odinga has been travelling throughout the East African
nation in recent weeks leading a campaign to convince voters to
approve a new constitution in an Aug. 4 referendum, it added.
