             Anglo American Plc , the third-largest
producer of copper in Chile, signed three-year wage agreements
at its Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde mines in the South American
country to avert strikes.  
 The 630 workers at both units agreed to a new accord that
will expire November 2013, the London-based company said today
in an e-mailed statement. Anglo spokesman Marcelo Esquivel
declined to disclose terms of the contract in an e-mailed
response to questions.  
 Mantoverde produced 61,500 metric tons of copper in 2009
and Mantos Blancos 90,200 tons, according to the company’s
website. Workers at mines owned by state-owned Codelco and  BHP
Billiton Ltd. , the two largest Chilean copper producers, went on
strike last year to seek bigger wage increases and bonuses.  
 Labor contracts at Anglo’s larger Los Bronces mine expire
in December 2012.
