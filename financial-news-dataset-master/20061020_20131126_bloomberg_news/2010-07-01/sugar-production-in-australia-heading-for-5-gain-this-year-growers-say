             Australian raw sugar production is
still expected to rise 5 percent this year, Canegrowers Chief
Executive Officer Ian Ballantyne said today after the first
month of the harvest.  
 “At the moment things are travelling relatively well and
according to our expectations,” he said by phone from Brisbane.
The group in May forecast production this year at 4.4 million to
4.5 million metric tons.
