             Toyota Motor Corp.  said 270,000 of
its Lexus-brand vehicles may have a problem causing engines to
stall, less than a week after the Japanese carmaker stopped
selling another Lexus vehicle because of a risk of fuel leaks.  
 As many as seven Lexus models and Toyota’s Crown may be
affected, and the carmaker is considering its next step to
address the problem, spokeswoman  Ririko Takeuchi  said by phone
in Tokyo today. The company may recall the Lexus LS460 sedan
because of engine stalling, Nikkei English News reported earlier,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The world’s biggest carmaker is working to restore its
reputation for quality after  recalling  about 8 million vehicles
globally for defects linked to sudden, unintended acceleration.
The company, based in Toyota City, Japan, recalled about 13,000
Lexus GX 460 sport-utility vehicles in April after Consumer
Reports magazine labeled the model a “safety risk” because it
could roll over under certain driving conditions. The
designation was removed in May.  
 “If Toyota decides to recall the models, concern that
customers may avoid the Toyota brand is bigger than the
potential cost of the recall,” said  Satoru Takada , an analyst
in Tokyo at TIW Inc.  
 Toyota said on June 25 it would stop selling its new hybrid
HS250h sedan because of too much fuel spilled in government
crash tests, posing a fire risk. The company, which paid a
record $16.4 million U.S. fine this year for not complying with
auto-safety regulations, said in a letter to the U.S. National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration that about 17,000 of the
HS250h sedans for the 2010 model year were being recalled.  
 The models with engines that may stall are the Lexus GS 350,
GS 450h, GS 460, IS 350, LS 460, LS 600h and LS 600hL, and the
Toyota Crown, the company said today. About 90,000 vehicles may
be affected in Japan, Takeuchi said.  
 Some models with 4.6-liter and 3.5-liter engines have a
problem with valve springs that may, in the worst case, cause
the engine to stall, Takeuchi said.
