             Hurricane Alex was downgraded to a
tropical storm after its maximum sustained wind speed slowed to
70 miles per hour from 80 mph and it came ashore from the Gulf
of Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said today in an
advisory on its website.  
 Alex is expected to dissipate during the next 24 to 36
hours, the data agency said. The earliest Atlantic hurricane 
since 1995 was about 55 miles west of Ciudad Victoria, Mexico,
the center said just before 7 a.m. Central Time. The storm,
earlier a Category 2 system with winds reaching 100 mph, was
heading west at 12 mph and will continue to move inland
today, according to the forecast.
