             Sharp Corp. may more than double its
production capacity of solar cells, by March 2013, Tetsuo
Onishi, head of the company’s solar system unit, said at a
conference in Yokohama, near Tokyo today.  
 “We’ll probably strengthen our capacity in line with the
market growth,” Onishi said. Sharp estimates the global
solar-cell market to expand to 16.9 gigawatts in fiscal 2012,
from 7.7 gigawatts in 2009, he said.  
 The Osaka-based company’s production capacity of solar
cells was 792 megawatts as of March this year, Onishi said.
