             U.S. bank takeovers may accelerate
after a “dearth of deals” since the financial crisis,
according to analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  
 Banks are better capitalized, have limited opportunities to
expand internally, and at 8,000 lenders and thrifts in the U.S.,
the industry “still suffers from overcapacity,” the analysts
led by  Christopher McGratty  wrote in a research note dated
yesterday.  
 BB&T Corp. ,  PNC Financial Services Group Inc. , and  US
Bancorp  are among 38 banks most likely to be buyers, KBW said.
The three lenders have strong capital bases, growth prospects,
profitability and valuations, the note said.  
 Mergers and acquisitions among U.S. banks peaked at $218
billion in 2007 and fell to $139 billion in 2008 and $146
billion in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The four largest banks by assets,  Bank of America Corp. ,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ,  Citigroup Inc.  and  Wells Fargo & Co. , may
be limited in acquiring other lenders due to “too-big-to-fail”
concerns, KBW said.  
 Another 26 banks were singled out by the KBW analysts as
potential sellers, including Abington Bancorp Inc., Boston
Private Financial Holdings Inc., Encore Bancshares Inc. and
Wilmington Trust Corp.
