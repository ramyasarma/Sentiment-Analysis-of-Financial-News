             China’s manufacturing expanded at a
slower pace in June.    
 The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.1 from 53.9 in
May, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in an e-
mailed statement today. That was less than the median 53.2
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists.
