             Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu called on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud
Abbas to enter direct negotiations on a Middle East peace
agreement, in remarks before a trip to Washington.  
 “I’m ready anytime,” Netanyahu said at U.S. Ambassador
James Cunningham’s residence near Tel Aviv late today. “Let’s
not waste another 15 months before we sit down together.”  
 Netanyahu has been in office for 15 months and hasn’t met
with Abbas. The U.S. envoy George Mitchell is acting as a
mediator between the sides in indirect talks.  
 Turning to Iran, the Israeli leader praised sanctions
passed by the U.S. Congress and said other countries should
follow with similar steps over the Iranian nuclear program.
