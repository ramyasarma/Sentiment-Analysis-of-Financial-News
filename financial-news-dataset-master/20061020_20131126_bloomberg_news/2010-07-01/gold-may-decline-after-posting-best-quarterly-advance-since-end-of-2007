             Gold, little changed in London today,
may extend its best quarterly advance since the end of 2007 as
concern over the economic recovery spurs demand for bullion as a
means of protecting wealth.  
 European equities dropped for a third day after China’s
manufacturing growth slowed and Moody’s Investors Service said
it may cut Spain’s top credit rating. Gold climbed 12 percent
the previous three months, the seventh straight quarterly gain
and the longest winning streak since 1979.  
 “Given the current concerns over inflation, slowing
economic recovery and European debt the metal may look to extend
higher as investors continue to diversify from fiat
currencies,” said  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com
in London.  
 Gold for immediate delivery added 53 cents to $1,242.78 an
ounce at 11:25 a.m. in London. Prices rose 2.1 percent last
month. The metal for August delivery was 0.2 percent lower at
$1,243.40 on the Comex in New York.  
 The metal fell to $1,240 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,244 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 Bullion has climbed 13 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,265.30 an ounce on June 21, as investors sought to protect
their wealth from prolonged financial turbulence in Europe and
on concern the global recovery may slow. The MSCI World Index of
equities slipped 11 percent this year and the euro declined 14
percent against the dollar.  
 Spanish Downgrade?  
 “Deteriorating” growth prospects and challenges in
meeting fiscal targets mean Spain’s top classification may be
lowered by as much as two grades, Moody’s analysts said
yesterday. The review will be concluded within three months, the
ratings company said.  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of five-year
debt today, reaching the target for the auction. The European
Central Bank said today it will lend financial institutions
111.2 billion euros for six days to help them cope with the
expiry of its landmark 12-month loan.  
 “For the time being, gold looks likely to remain in demand
as a safe haven,”  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodity research at
Commerzbank AG, wrote in a report yesterday. Still, that trend
may be countered by weak seasonal demand for gold from India,
the largest importer, Weinberg said.  
 Purchases by India may tumble by as much as 36 percent this
year as higher prices and volatility slow demand, the Indian
Bullion Market Association said. Imports may be about 350 metric
tons to 400 tons in the year ending March 31, 2011, compared
with about 550 tons a year earlier, the association’s President
 Anjani Sinha  said yesterday in an interview in Mumbai. Imports
are down by about half in the last three to four months, he
said.  
 Platinum, Palladium Fall  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at a record 1,320.44
metric tons yesterday, according to the company’s website.
Global holdings of the metal by ETFs were little changed at an
all-time high 2,067.8 tons yesterday, according to  Bloomberg
data  from 10 providers.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London was little changed
at $18.62 an ounce. The metal gained 6.5 percent the previous
three months for a sixth straight quarterly advance, the best
streak since the beginning of 1980. Platinum was 0.9 percent
lower at $1,520.07 an ounce, and palladium was down 0.3 percent
at $440.90 an ounce.
