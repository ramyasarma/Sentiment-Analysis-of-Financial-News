             Toshiba Corp. will supply lithium-ion
batteries for an electric vehicle that Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
will introduce soon, Nikkei English News said, without saying
where it got the information.  
 Mitsubishi Motors and partner PSA Peugeot Citroen plan to
introduce the new electric vehicle, designed for short
distances, by fiscal 2012 at a price of less than 2 million yen
($22,800), Nikkei said.
