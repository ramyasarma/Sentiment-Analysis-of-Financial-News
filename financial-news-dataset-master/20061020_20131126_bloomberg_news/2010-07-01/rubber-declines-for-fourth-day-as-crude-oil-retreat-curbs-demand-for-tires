             Rubber slumped for a fourth day as
crude oil extended losses, reducing the appeal of the commodity
used to make tires.  
 Futures in Tokyo declined as much as 2.4 percent to the
lowest level in almost three weeks. Oil, base metals and Asian
 stocks  dropped after China’s manufacturing growth slowed and
Moody’s Investors Service placed Spain’s credit rating on
review for a possible downgrade.  
 “Concern over the slowing global economy kept putting
downward pressure on industrial commodities and equities,”
 Takaki Shigemoto , an analyst at JSC Corp., said today.  
 December-delivery rubber lost as much as 6.4 yen to 262.8
yen per kilogram ($2,982 a metric ton), the lowest level since
June 11, on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, before closing at
264.7 yen. The price dropped 12.7 percent in the second quarter,
the first loss since 2008.  
 Crude oil fell for a fourth day, with the August-delivery
contract declining as much as 1.9 percent o $74.21 a barrel
after reports from the U.S. showed companies added fewer
workers in June than forecast and an unexpected increase in
gasoline stockpiles in the largest energy consumer.  
 Copper in London fell as much as 2.4 percent to $6,360 a
ton and the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  dropped as much as 1.7
percent to 110.91.  
 China’s manufacturing expanded at a slower pace for a
second month in June, adding to signs that growth in the
world’s third-largest  economy  is moderating. The  Purchasing
Managers’ Index  fell to 52.1 from 53.9 in May, the Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said today. That was less than the
median 53.2 estimate in a Bloomberg News  survey  of 12
economists.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 1.9 percent to close at 21,175 yuan ($3,121) a ton. China
is the world’s largest auto market and the biggest consumer of
natural rubber.
