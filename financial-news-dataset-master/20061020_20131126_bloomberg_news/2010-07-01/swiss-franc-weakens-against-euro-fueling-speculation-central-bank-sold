             The Swiss franc declined by the most
in six weeks against the euro, fueling speculation the Swiss
National Bank resumed selling the currency to prevent its gains
from hindering the country’s economic recovery.  
 The currency slumped against the common currency after
earlier reaching a record on a report that showed Swiss
manufacturing expanded for a 10th month. The franc gained most
against the South African rand among its 16 most-actively traded
peers as a decline in stocks boosted demand for the currency as
haven from Europe’s sovereign debt crisis. SNB spokesman  Werner Abegg  declined to comment.  
 “The SNB is obviously in the market selling and that’s
pushed the franc lower,” said  Toshi Honda , a strategist at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “Given the weakness in
equity markets, you can tell the market has been avoiding risk”
and the franc benefited, Honda said.  
 The franc lost as much as 1.7 percent, the most since May
19, to 134.01 per euro and was trading at 1.3292 as of 5:11 p.m.
in London. It earlier strengthened to 1.3074, the strongest
level since the euro’s 1999 debut. The franc gained 1 percent to
1.0672 per dollar. It rose 2 percent to 7.2622 rand.  
 The Swiss National Bank, which has been buying foreign
currencies since March 2009 to counter the threat of deflation,
said on June 17 the risk has “largely disappeared.” It also
said in its  quarterly bulletin  that it would take necessary
measures to ensure price stability.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  dropped 2.5 percent. The  SVME
purchasing managers’ index  slipped to 65.7 in June from 66.4 the
previous month, Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG said. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  
 The franc has risen 3.6 percent against the common European
currency since June 17.
