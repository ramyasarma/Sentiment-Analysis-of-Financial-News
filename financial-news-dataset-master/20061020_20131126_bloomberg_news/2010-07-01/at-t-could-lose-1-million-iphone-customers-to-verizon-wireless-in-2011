             AT&T Inc.  may lose as many as 1
million iPhone customers next year as rival Verizon Wireless
begins selling the Apple Inc. device, according to analysts’
estimates.  
 Between 500,000 and 1 million of AT&T’s estimated 18
million iPhone users may end their contracts early or decline to
renew them in 2011 in favor of a Verizon Wireless contract, said
Barclays Capital analyst  James Ratcliffe . Pacific Crest
Securities analyst  Steve Clement  forecast the losses at about
800,000 users.  
 “It’s also going to reduce AT&T’s ability to attract new
subscribers once there’s an alternative out there,” said
Clement, who is based in Portland, Oregon.  
 The estimates don’t include normal customer additions and
losses, known as churn. AT&T is still likely to increase its
overall number of wireless customers next year, the analysts
said.  
 Verizon Wireless, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, will
begin offering the  iPhone  on its network in January, ending the
exclusivity AT&T has held since the device’s introduction in
2007, two people familiar with the plans said this week.  
 The number of AT&T customers Verizon Wireless attracts is
limited because many have existing two-year contracts and would
have to pay a fee to end them early,  Chris Larsen , a Piper
Jaffray & Co. analyst in New York, said in an interview. Apple
said it sold 1.7 million iPhone 4s in five countries in the
first three days, boosting AT&T’s base of users under contract.  
 Apple, based in Cupertino, California, has sold more than
50 million iPhones since it was first introduced in 2007.  
 AT&T’s Hold  
 “We are very confident about our position with exclusivity
or without,”  Mark Siegel , an AT&T spokesman, said in an
interview. “We’re not dependent on a single smartphone to be
competitive, we offer a lot of great devices.”  
 About 70 percent of AT&T’s customer base is in a Family
Talk plan, which has a high rate of retention,  Ralph de la Vega ,
the carrier’s head of wireless, said in May.  
 “For Verizon, it will largely be selling the iPhone to
existing customers,’” said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst  Timothy Horan  in a research note today. Horan, who is based in New York,
said AT&T is making network upgrades that should help it retain
users.  
 Jeffrey Nelson , a Verizon Wireless spokesman, declined to
comment.  
 AT&T’s Contracts  
 “What AT&T is trying to do is get customers to upgrade to
the new iPhone and sign a new two-year contract and in the
meantime they’ll work to improve their network,” said Piper
Jaffray’s Larsen. “So you won’t want to opt out because of the
termination fee and in two years hopefully you’re happy with
your service and you don’t want to switch.”  
 Cancelling an AT&T contract costs $325, less $10 for each
month of service, according to the Dallas-based carrier’s Web
site.  
 Verizon Wireless may sell as many as 12 million iPhones in
the first year it offers the device, said UBS AG analyst John Hodulik  in New York. It may draw between 3 and 4 million new
customers from rival wireless carriers, he said.  
 The company had 92.8 million subscribers at the end of the
first quarter, after adding 1.6 million during the period. AT&T
had 87 million subscribers, after adding 1.9 million during the
first quarter.  
 AT&T rose 15 cents to $24.34 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  Verizon Communications Inc. , which
co-owns the wireless company with Vodafone Group Plc, gained 11
cents to $28.13. Apple lost $3.05 to $248.48 on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
