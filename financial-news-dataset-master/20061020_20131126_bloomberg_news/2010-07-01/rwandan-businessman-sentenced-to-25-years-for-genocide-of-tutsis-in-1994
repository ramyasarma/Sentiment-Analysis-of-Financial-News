             The tribunal prosecuting suspects in
Rwanda’s 1994 genocide sentenced a former Rwandan businessman to
25 years in jail after ruling he was directly responsible for
the deaths of more than 5,000 ethnic Tutsis.  
 Yussuf Munyakazi , who was born in 1935, was found guilty of
 genocide  and extermination as a crime against humanity by a
three-judge panel, the Tanzania-based  International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda  said in a  statement  late yesterday.  
 Munyakazi led the Interahamwe militia in attacking Tutsi
refugees in two incidents at churches, on April 29 and 30, 1994,
according to the statement from the United Nations-backed court.  
 “He was liable for the death of over 5,000 Tutsi
civilians,” the tribunal said.  
 Munyakazi was arrested in the Democratic Republic of Congo
on May 5, 1994, and sent to the detention center at the court,
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. He will remain there
until he is transferred to another country to serve out his
prison term, according to the statement.  
 As many as 800,000 people, more than a 10th of Rwanda’s
population, died in a 100-day slaughter of minority Tutsis and
moderate Hutus by ethnic Hutu militias.  
 The massacre began after the assassination of Rwanda’s
President  Juvenal Habyarimana , whose plane was shot down as it
prepared to land in the capital, Kigali, on April 6, 1994.
