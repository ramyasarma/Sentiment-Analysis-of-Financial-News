             Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s largest
brokerage, said it hired  Alexis Lasser  from Standard Chartered
Bank as head of private capital markets in the Americas.  
 Lasser will report to  Glenn Schiffman , head of investment
banking for the Americas, and global finance head  Philippe Dufournier , the Tokyo-based company said in the statement.  
 Lasser was head of the illiquid and private placements
group at Standard Chartered. Prior to that, she worked at Lehman
Brothers on the private capital markets team, Nomura said.  
 Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage, is hiring as many as 35
bankers in the U.S. this year, Schiffman said in an interview
last month. The firm plans to have about 100 bankers in the U.S.
by the end of 2010, from about 65 last month, in a push to
become a global securities firm that rivals Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG.
