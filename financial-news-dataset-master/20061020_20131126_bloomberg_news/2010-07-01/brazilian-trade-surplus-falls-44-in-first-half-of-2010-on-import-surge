             Brazil’s trade  surplus  fell 44
percent in the first half of 2010 from the same period a year
ago as domestic growth boosted imports of consumer goods and
exports missed estimates, the  Trade Ministry  said.  
 The trade surplus narrowed to $7.9 billion in the first
half, down from $13.9 billion in the same period a year ago, the
ministry said.  Imports  rose 43.9 percent to $81.3 billion, while
 exports  grew 26.5 percent to $89.2 billion.  
 Brazil posted a $2.28 billion trade surplus in June, 50.5
percent less than in June last year, as imports rose more than
exports, the ministry said. Economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg
expected a $2.9 billion surplus, according to the median
estimate from 19 analysts.  
 “Imports are booming on domestic demand, in good part
because of capital goods for industry,”  Luis Otavio Leal , chief
economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA said in a telephone interview
from Sao Paulo today. “With this pace of economic activity, the
trend for the trade balance is worsening. It’ll depend on how
commodity prices behave.”  
 The trade balance outlook is still positive for 2010, with
Leal expecting a surplus of about $10 billion. Another increase
in iron ore prices may boost the surplus to as much as $15
billion, he said.  
 Imports of consumer goods rose 49 percent in the first half
of the year to $13.8 billion, from $9.17 billion a year ago,
Fabio Faria, deputy trade secretary, told reporters in Brasilia
today. The jump was sustained by an “accelerated” growth of
Brazil’s gross domestic product.  
 Commodity Prices  
 Higher commodity prices led the government last month to
raise its estimate for exports to $180 billion this year, up
from $168 billion.  
 Latin America’s biggest economy may  expand  7.3 percent this
year, the fastest growth in more than two decades, after growing
9 percent in the first quarter, the central bank said in its
quarterly inflation report yesterday. Faster growth may stoke
 inflation  above the government’s 4.5 percent target until the
second quarter of 2012, the bank said.  
 Domestic demand in Brazil may boost imports by 27.8 percent
this year, up from a previous forecast of 20.4 percent, the
central bank said yesterday. Exports may rise 12.6 percent, up
from a previous 12 percent forecast, and the trade surplus may
fall to $13 billion this year, down from $25.3 billion in 2009.  
 Brazil had foreign sales of $17.1 billion last month and
bought $14.8 billion from abroad, the Trade Ministry said.
Economists predicted exports of $17.8 billion and imports of
$14.9 billion, according to the median forecast of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Sales to China, Brazil’s top trade partner, declined 2.9
percent in June to $2.82 billion, led by a drop in shipments of
soybeans last month, Faria said. Brazil’s surplus with China
shrank 40.6 percent this year to $2.71 billion in the first
half, after imports from China jumped 57.7 percent.  
 Brazil’s exports to the U.S. expanded 22.3 percent in the
first half to $9.01 billion, while imports rose 23.2 percent, to
$12.2 billion, the ministry said.  
 Lower Yield  
 Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contracts fell
as a report showed industrial production in Brazil rose less
than forecast in May.  
 The yield on the contract due in September, the most traded
in Sao Paulo today, rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 10.60 percent at 4:44 p.m. New York time.  
 Policy makers will raise the  benchmark rate  to 11 percent
in this month’s meeting, according to a central bank weekly
survey of about 100 economists published this week.  
 The real strengthened 0.8 percent to 1.7895 per dollar, from
1.8047 yesterday. The currency rose 0.9 percent in June.
