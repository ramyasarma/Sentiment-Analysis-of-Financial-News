             Soybeans rose for the first time in
three days as a weaker dollar spurred investor demand for crops
and reduced the cost of exports from the U.S, the biggest
shipper of the oilseed.  
 The dollar tumbled to a seven-month low against the yen and
fell as much as 2 percent against the euro after European
leaders announced an almost $1 trillion package to support debt-
laden governments. U.S. exporters sold 264,000 metric tons of
soybeans in the week ended June 24, up 45 percent from the prior
four-week average, the Department of Agriculture said today.  
 “The weaker dollar is providing a lift to soybeans,” said
 Mario Balletto , a market analyst for CitiGroup Global Markets in
Chicago. “There may be some new investment money coming back
into the market.”  
 Soybeans for November delivery rose 3 cents, or 0.3 percent
to $9.055 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the
most-active contract fell to $8.94, the lowest level since June.
11. The commodity has dropped 14 percent this year.  
 Prices also rose after the government said yesterday that
U.S. reserves on June 1, following a record 2009 harvest, were
4.2 percent lower than a year earlier, Balletto said.  
 Supplies totaled 571 million bushels, down from 596
million, the USDA said. That’s the smallest June 1 inventory
since 2004. Eight analysts in a Bloomberg News survey expected
592 million bushels, on average.  
 U.S. soybean reserves before this year’s harvest may fall
to 160 million bushels compared with 185 million estimated last
month by the USDA, Balletto said.  
 “We are looking for tighter supplies,” Balletto said.
“Demand is still good.”  
 The soybean crop in the U.S., the world’s largest grower,
was valued at $31.8 billion last year, second only to corn at
$48.6 billion, government figures show.
