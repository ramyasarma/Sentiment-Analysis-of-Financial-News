             Crude oil tumbled to a three-week low
on concern economic growth in the U.S. and China will slow,
curbing demand in the two largest energy-consuming countries.  
 Oil slipped 3.5 percent after U.S. manufacturing increased
at a slower pace last month and the Labor Department reported
that more Americans applied for jobless benefits last week.
China’s manufacturing growth slowed for a second month in June,
adding to signs the fastest-expanding major economy is cooling,
according to a survey.  
 “The market is very sensitive right now,” said  David Greely , head of energy research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
New York. “There’s a much more negative view of the outlook
over the last two months. There definitely are concerns about
growth.”  
 Crude oil for August delivery declined $2.68 to $72.95 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest
settlement price since June 8. Futures are down 8.1 percent this
year. The market is in its longest pullback since a six-day drop
that ended on May 18.  
 Brent crude for August delivery slipped $2.67, or 3.6
percent, to end the session at $72.34 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It also was the lowest
settlement since June 8.  
 The Institute for Supply Management’s  gauge  of
manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier,
according to the Tempe, Arizona-based group. A reading greater
than 50 points to expansion. Economists had forecast the measure
would fall to 59, according to the median of 81 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Double-Dip Recession  
 “We could have a double-dip recession,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
Florida. “Until we get some decent economic numbers, oil is
going to have a hard time getting its head much above water.
We’re going to get rallies in oil but every dollar up is going
to be a battle because of headwinds in the U.S. economy.”  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  declined 0.8 percent to
1,022.96 at 3:23 p.m. in New York, and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped 77.39 points, or 0.8 percent, to 9,696.63.  
 U.S. initial jobless claims  increased  by 13,000 to 472,000
in the week ended June 26, the Labor Department said. Economists
forecast applications would fall to 455,000 from an initially
reported 457,000 for the prior week, according to the median of
46 projections in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The Labor Department tomorrow may report payrolls fell by
130,000 in June, reflecting cuts in temporary census workers as
the decennial survey nears completion, according to the median
estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Private
payrolls, which are more revealing of labor-market conditions,
probably rose by 110,000 after a 41,000 gain the prior month.  
 Tomorrow’s Report  
 “Everyone is waiting for tomorrow’s unemployment number,”
said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in Chicago. “If it’s bad,
crude will head for $65. It all hinges on the report.”  
 China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 52.1 from 53.9
in May, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in
an e-mailed statement. This missed a median 53.2 estimate from
12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 “We continue to expect the economy to slow down in the
second half of the year, but still expect that global economic
growth in 2010 and 2011 will be above average,” Greely said.  
 Prices also dropped because of rising fuel inventories.
 Gasoline inventories  rose 537,000 barrels to 218.1 million in
the week ended June 25, according to an Energy Department report
yesterday. Supplies were forecast to decrease by 400,000
barrels, based on a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  
 Fuel Demand  
 U.S. fuel consumption  declined  2.7 percent to 19 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since April, according to the
department.  
 “The disappointing economic news has allowed the market to
concentrate on the fundamental picture,” said  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut. “Yesterday’s unexpected fuel supply increase and
weak demand numbers were very negative.”  
 Crude stockpiles fell 2.01 million barrels last week to
363.1 million, partly on reduced imports, the Energy Department
report showed.  
 Tropical Storm Alex is losing power after coming ashore
overnight in Mexico. The storm forced the shutdown of a quarter
of the U.S.’s Gulf of Mexico oil production. At its height, Alex
reached Category 2 status with winds of 100 mph (161 kph), the
earliest Atlantic hurricane since 1995 and the first of the 2010
season.  
 Consistent Picture  
 “There’s not much bullish news to offset the negative
economic sentiment,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York. “It’s a consistent picture
here. The only things I can point to are the shut-ins that
occurred because of Alex and the drop in OPEC production.”  
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude-
oil output decreased 157,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to an
average 29.23 million barrels a day in June, according to a
Bloomberg News survey yesterday.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 633,434 contracts at 3:10 p.m.
in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 596,039
contracts yesterday, 23 percent less than the average of the
past three months. Open interest was 1.26 million contracts.
