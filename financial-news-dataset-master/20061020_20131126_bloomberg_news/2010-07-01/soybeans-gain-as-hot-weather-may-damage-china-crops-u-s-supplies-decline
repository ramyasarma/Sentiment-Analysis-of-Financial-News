             Soybean futures advanced in Chicago
on signs supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest exporter,
may tighten before the next harvest as dry weather threatens the
crop in China. Wheat in Paris climbed 3.8 percent, the most in
four months.  
 Soybean stockpiles from last year’s crop totaled 571
million bushels as of June 1, the smallest since 2004, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Soybean and corn
crops in northeast China “appear to be somewhat at risk due to
periodic hot weather,” Telvent DTN Inc. said yesterday.  
 “That’s something the market has been focusing some
attention on: the Chinese weather outlook,”  Toby Hassall , a
research analyst at CWA Global Markets Pty, said by phone from
Sydney.  
 November-delivery soybeans rose as much as 0.7 percent to
$9.09 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at $9.0525
a bushel at 11:54 a.m. in London.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery jumped 3.8 percent to
136.5 euros ($168.35) a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
Paris. A close at that price would be the biggest one-day gain
since Feb. 25.  
 Dry weather in the U.K. has the “potential to impact
yield” of the wheat crop harvest that will start late this
month, said  Susan Twining , an analyst at ADAS U.K. Ltd., in
Cambridgeshire, England. The U.K. winter wheat crop will be an
estimated 15.5 million to 16 million tons this year, up from
14.4 million tons last year, she said.  
 Bread, Biscuits  
 About a quarter of the U.K. wheat crop is used for the
milling variety in bread and biscuit making, she said.  
 “This is a critical time when dry weather can make a big
difference to yield and given the dryness of the soil at the
moment we will need some rain to meet the yield potential
between now and harvest,” she said.  
 U.S. export sales of soybeans likely advanced in the week
through June 24 from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
News survey. Exports may be between 200,000 tons and 500,000
tons, up from 193,541 tons a year ago, according to the survey.
The USDA is scheduled to release its report on overseas sales at
8:30 a.m. in Washington today.  
 Corn for December delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $3.75
a bushel. Futures yesterday jumped 8.6 percent, the biggest
surge since Sept. 15, after the USDA said farmers in the U.S.,
the largest grower and exporter, planted less than they intended
in March.
