             The Tsai family, which controls
 Taiwan Mobile Co.  and its parent, may buy $1 billion of assets
in cable TV operator  Kbro Co.  from Carlyle Group, pending easing
of restrictions on state ownership of media companies.  
 “It’s possible,” Taiwan Mobile Chairman  Richard Tsai  said
in an e-mailed reply to a question if the family would buy the
stake in its personal capacity. “We haven’t finalized any
alternative plan.”  
 Combining Kbro with Taiwan Mobile would have created the
largest operator in a market where more than 80 percent of homes
tune in to cable television. Taiwan Mobile, the nation’s second-
largest phone operator, failed to complete the deal by
yesterday’s deadline because  Fubon Financial Holding Co. , one of
its shareholders, is partly state-owned.  
 State rules bar any government-related entity from owning
shares in media companies such as Kbro. The Taipei-based
 National Communications Commission  in January proposed the
Cabinet allow the government to indirectly own as much as 10
percent of media companies. The plan also needs legislative
approval.  
 Taiwan Mobile said on Sept. 16 it agreed to buy unlisted
Kbro from Carlyle for $1 billion in cash and stock. Carlyle
would sell its holding in Kbro for a 15.5 percent stake in
Taiwan Mobile and NT$440 million ($14 million) in cash.  
 Alternatives are being considered as both companies have
strong intent to complete the transaction, Taiwan Mobile said
yesterday in a stock exchange filing.  
 Daniel Tsai , chairman of Fubon Financial, didn’t reply to
e-mails seeking comment.  Dorothy Lee , a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman at Carlyle, and  Josephine Juan , a spokeswoman of
Taiwan Mobile based in Taipei, declined to comment.  
 Taiwan Mobile has risen 25 percent in Taipei trading since
the company announced its plans to buy Kbro. The benchmark  Taiex
index  has fallen 1.5 percent in the period.  
 Washington-based Carlyle, the world’s second-largest buyout
firm, bought control of Eastern Multimedia, which includes the
cable TV unit that was renamed Kbro, for $1.5 billion in 2006.
