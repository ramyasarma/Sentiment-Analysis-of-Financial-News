             Telecom Italia SpA, Italy’s biggest
phone company, is being investigated in Milan for alleged market
manipulation as a result of a separate probe into false mobile-
phone pre-paid card sales.  
 Milan magistrates  Francesco Greco  and Laura Pedio are
investigating whether Telecom Italia’s allegedly inflated
 mobile-phone market share data  until 2007 constituted market
manipulation, according to a statement today from Italy’s
finance police.  
 The Milan investigation comes as police in the northern
Italian city of Vicenza said they are  probing  30 Telecom Italia
dealers for faking sales of phone cards, according to a police
statement. The dealers allegedly registered thousands of new
phone card sales to existing customers.  
 Milan-based Telecom Italia has already been fined 3.4
million euros ($4.2 million) for failing to run checks on
customers’ personal data. The company paid a reduced fine of 1.1
million euros on May 27, according to the police statement.
Telecom Italia disclosed the probe in its 2008 and 2009 annual
reports and its commercial practices were reviewed after 2007,
the company said in an e-mailed statement.  
 Telecom Italia added that it’s cooperating with authorities
in the investigation.  
 Police said that between January 2006 and October 2007 more
than 2.4 million mobile phone cards could be traced to single
users who supposedly possessed more than 15 cards each.
Investigators found 37,000 pre-paid cards registered to 200
unaware customers. Police noted a “strong discontinuity” in
the practice after  Franco Bernabe  became chief executive officer
of Telecom Italia in 2007.  
 Telecom Italia’s share of the Italian mobile market fell to
40.3 percent in December 2007 from 40.5 percent in January 2006,
according to a  presentation  on its website.
