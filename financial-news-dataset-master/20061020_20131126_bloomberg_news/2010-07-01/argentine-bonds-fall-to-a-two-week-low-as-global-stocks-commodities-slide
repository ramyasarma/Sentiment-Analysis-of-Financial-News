             Argentine bonds fell to a two-week
low as a global stock slide and decline in commodity prices
prompted investors to sell higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 rose 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage point, to 13.64
percent at 11:11 a.m. New York time, according to Deutsche Bank
pricing. The price fell 1 cent to 77.5 cents on the dollar, the
lowest since June 15.  
 U.S. stocks and commodities fell after U.S. data on
manufacturing, jobless claims and home sales fueled concern the
economic recovery is faltering.  
 “There’s definitely an element of risk aversion upon us at
this moment,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an emerging markets economist
with Wells Fargo in New York. “Some of the commodities
currencies are getting hit, and that will feed into a credit
like Argentina.”  
 Argentina’s peso was little changed at 3.9316 per dollar,
from 3.9305 yesterday.
