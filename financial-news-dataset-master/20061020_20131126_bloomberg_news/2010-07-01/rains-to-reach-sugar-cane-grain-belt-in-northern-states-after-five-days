             India’s monsoon rainfall, the main
source of irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers, may
not reach the rice and sugar cane growing regions in the north
for the next four-five days, delaying sowing, an official said.  
 Rains have not moved beyond some parts of Madhya Pradesh,
the largest soybean-growing state, since June 16, and over the
northeast regions since June 18, D. Sivananda Pai, a director at
the  India Meteorological Department , said in a phone interview.  
 The monsoon weather system is reviving over the southern
peninsula and the western coast, he said.  
 The bureau expects the seasonal falls to be 102 percent of
the 50-year average, Pai said, repeating last week’s forecast.
