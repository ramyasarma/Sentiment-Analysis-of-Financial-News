             The yen will probably extend gains
against peers amid the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and
concern that the global economic recovery is stalling, according
to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  
 “The strong performance of the yen is expected to continue
while sovereign-debt concerns remain elevated and investors re-
adjust their expectations for global growth lower,”  Lee Hardman , a London-based foreign-exchange economist at the
lender, wrote in a note today. “The adjustment lower for risk
assets has only just begun, leaving further scope for yen
outperformance alongside other safe-haven currencies.”  
 The Japanese currency rose against all 16 of its most-
actively traded peers this year. It was 0.4 percent weaker at
108.63 per euro as of 1:50 p.m. in London, leaving its gain
since Dec. 31 at 18.5 percent.
