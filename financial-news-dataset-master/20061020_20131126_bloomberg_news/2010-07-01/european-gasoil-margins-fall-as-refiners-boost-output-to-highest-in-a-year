             European gasoil margins narrowed 17
percent in the last week as refiners in the region boosted
output to the highest level in a year and Russian exports of the
fuel climbed to the most in at least four months.  
 The front month August gasoil crack, or premium to Brent
crude, shrunk to as little as $11.31 a barrel on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange, from $11.61 yesterday. That’s down 17
percent from this year’s high of $13.57 on June 22.  
 “European runs have surpassed the 80 percent level for the
first time in about a year in recent weeks,”  David Wech , head
of research at JBC Energy GMBH said in a report today.  
 That’s up from 75.5 percent in April, the lowest rate since
November, according the International Energy Agency’s Monthly
Oil Report on June 10, when European refiners such as  Total SA 
and  Neste OYJ  processed 11.92 million barrels a day of crude. It
was last above 80 percent in April 2009, IEA data show.  
 The drop in distillate cracks, a category of fuels that
include heating oil and diesel, indicate that either the
economic recovery is not that healthy or that refiners have
raised runs too much, or both, Wech said.  
 “Further upside for gasoil crack is limited,” analysts at
Societe Generale led by  Michael Wittner  said in a report on June
28. “Gasoil inventories in the U.S. and Europe remain near
five-year highs and refinery runs in the U.S. and Europe have
been increasing seasonally.”  
 July ICE gasoil futures traded close to a three-week low at
$630.25 a metric ton, down 2.25 percent from yesterday and down
9 percent in the last nine days.  
 Discount Widens  
 The July-August gasoil contango, or discount of July
delivery cargoes to August, widened for a second day to $2.50 a
ton from $2.25 yesterday, implying increased supplies. The July-
December contango advanced to as much as $19 a ton, the biggest
gap in two weeks.  
 European imports of distillates are also likely to increase
as Russian refiners boost exports and U.S. Gulf Coast stockpiles
of the fuel reach a record high.  
 Russian exports of low-sulfur diesel from the port of
Primorsk on the Baltic Sea will rise 24 percent in July, the
highest in at least four months.  
 Exports will increase 121,000 tons to 635,000 tons in July
from 514,000 tons this month and 520,000 tons in May, according
to two people with knowledge of the loading schedules.  
 July diesel cargo swaps in Northwest Europe narrowed to a
premium $15.37 to ICE gasoil futures yesterday, the lowest level
in seven months.  
 “European margins are falling because there’s more
supply,”  Christophe Barret , Credit Agricole CIB oil analyst
said by phone from London today. “There is also the
anticipation that demand will remain relatively weak.”  
 Distillate stockpiles in the  U.S. Gulf Coast  rose for a
fifth week to 51.81 million barrels, the U.S. Department of
Energy said yesterday. Total U.S. distillate  inventories  rose
1.57 percent or 2.46 million barrels, higher than the forecast
million-barrel increase.
