             Hungary raised less than its target
at a debt auction today for a third time in less than a month as
its borrowing costs rose, reflecting investor concern that
Europe’s debt crisis hasn’t been contained.  
 The state debt management agency sold 45 billion forint
($193 million) in bonds, less than the 50 billion forint
planned, according to auction results on the debt management
agency’s Bloomberg page. Bids totaled 88.2 billion forint, it
said. The shortfall occurred in the offering of 10 billion
forint of floating rate bonds due in 2015, only half of which
were sold, it said.  
 Yields on Spanish five-year bonds and the cost to protect
against a default by the country rose today after Moody’s
Investors Service said it may downgrade Spain, which has the
euro region’s third-largest deficit. Public debt may reach 79
percent of gross domestic product in Hungary this year, making
the most indebted of the European Union’s eastern members,
according to European Commission estimates.  
 “Today’s auction took place in a negative market
environment, hence the rising yields,” said  Sandor Jobbagy , a
bond trader at Intesa Sanpaolo SpA’s local unit. “In an
environment characterized by high global risk aversion, I think
these results are bearable.”  
 Previous Auctions  
 Hungary, which had to resort to an  International Monetary
Fund -led bailout in 2008 to avert a default, is seeking a new,
“precautionary” IMF deal for 2011, Economy Minister Gyorgy
Matolcsy said yesterday. The new credit line would serve to
shore up investor confidence as the government will only use it
in case of market turbulence, Gyorgy Szapary, adviser to Prime
Minister Viktor Orban, said in an interview with FN.hu.  
 The debt management agency on June 24 sold 40 billion
forint of 12-month Treasury bills, 10 billion forint less than
planned, at a yield of 5.41 percent compared with 5.35 percent
on June 10, when it missed a 50 billion-forint goal by 15
billion forint.  
 Hungary today sold 25 billion forint of bonds maturing in
2013 at an average yield of 7.15 percent versus 7.01 percent at
the previous auction on June 17. It raised 15 billion forint in
the 2016 maturity at 7.5 percent versus 7.32 percent.  
 The forint weakened 0.9 percent to 287.18 per euro as of
2:05 p.m. in Budapest. The currency has lost 7.6 percent of its
value versus the euro in the past three months, the worst
performance among more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
