             U.S. stocks rose, giving the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index its first gain in four days, as  United Parcel
Service Inc . and  FedEx Corp . led an advance by transportation
companies and Citigroup Inc. rallied after the Treasury cut its
stake in the bank.  
 The S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent to 1,032.48 at 9:41 a.m. in
New York. September futures on the index had fallen earlier
following a report showing more Americans filed for unemployment
benefits than economists estimated.
