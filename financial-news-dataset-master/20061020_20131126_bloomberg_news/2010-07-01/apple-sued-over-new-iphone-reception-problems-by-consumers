             Apple Inc.  was sued over reception
problems with its new iPhone 4 by consumers who accused the
company of unfair business practices and false and misleading
advertising.  
 A New Jersey resident and a Massachusetts resident who had
bought the new mobile phone filed separate complaints yesterday
in federal court in San Francisco, each seeking to represent
other iPhone buyers in a class-action, or group, lawsuit. A
separate complaint was filed this morning in Maryland, alleging
Apple and wireless carrier AT&T Inc. were negligent in marketing
the phone.  
 The June 24 introduction of the iPhone 4 was marred by
criticism that signal strength diminishes when users cover the
bottom left corner of the phone with their palm. The iPhone,
which debuted in 2007, has become Apple’s top-selling product
even after users reported glitches and dropped calls with
previous versions of the device.  
 “Apple’s sale of the iPhone with this unannounced defect,
assuming Apple’s prior knowledge of the defect, constitutes
misrepresentation and fraud,” Christopher Dydyk of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, said in his complaint. “In omitting to disclose
the defect in the iPhone 4, Apple perpetrated a massive fraud
upon hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting customers.”  
 Bumper Solution  
 Apple, which sold more than 1.7 million of the new phones
in its first three days, has recommended users hold the phone
differently or use a case to solve the problem. Apple is selling
its own iPhone 4 cases in six colors for $29 each. They’re made
of a piece of rubber known as a “bumper,” which surrounds the
outer rim of the phone.  
 Dydyk, in his complaint, asked that Apple ship a bumper for
free to customers who pre-ordered an iPhone 4 before its release
or that the company be ordered to pay for customers’ bumpers.  
 Natalie Harrison , a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California,
based Apple, didn’t immediately return a call to her office or
respond to an e-mailed request for comment after regular
business hours.  
 Maryland residents Kevin McCaffrey and Linda Wrinn claim in
their complaint that Apple and AT&T “actively suppressed and
concealed the fact that the iPhone 4 could not be held in a
manner consistent with the normal usage of wireless
communication devices.” They seek unspecified damages and a
jury trial.  
 The California cases are Alan Benvenisty v. Apple, 10-2885,
and Christopher Dydyk v. Apple, 10-2897, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). The Maryland
case is Kevin McCaffrey and Linda Wrinn v. Apple Inc. and AT&T
INC., U.S. District Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore).
