             European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said that a greater range of
punishments is needed for countries that break the rules on
budget deficits.  
 It must be possible to apply the punishments faster to
prevent excess deficits from arising, and the sanctions must be
automatic and not leave room for interpretation, Rehn told
French daily Les Echos in an interview.  
 The idea of a member country leaving the euro currency area
is “surreal,” Rehn told the newspaper.
