             U.S. stocks pared declines amid
speculation that the recent slide in equities that dragged the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a nine-month low may have
overshot the potential slowdown in the economic recovery.  
 The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent to 1,026.72 at 12:48 p.m.
in New York after plunging 1.9 percent earlier. A 16 percent
slide since April 23 left the index trading at less than 15
times its companies’ profits, the cheapest valuation in more
than a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 38.99 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 9,735.03, trimming a decline of 152 points.  
 “The level of pessimism we’ve seen over the last several
days can be viewed as somewhat extreme given valuations,” said
Timothy Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset
Management in Bedford Hills, New York, which manages $2 billion.
“There’s certainly concern about the domestic economy. Overall
we’re still in an economic recovery and all signs point to a
continuation of that, perhaps at a slightly slower pace.”
