             Swiss stocks  dropped to a 10-month
low on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is expanding
and speculation the Chinese authorities are cooling growth in
the world’s largest emerging economy.  
 Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, Swatch Group AG and Holcim
Ltd. led losses among companies reliant on exports. UBS AG fell
3 percent.  
 The  Swiss Market Index  of the biggest and most actively
traded companies dropped 2.4 percent to 5,981.66, its lowest
closing level since Aug. 19. The broader  Swiss Performance Index 
lost 2.2 percent.  
 The SMI has declined 14 percent from this year’s high on
 April 15  as investors dump riskier assets on concern the global
economy will cool. Spain’s top Aaa credit ranking was placed on
review for a possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service
yesterday after markets closed. China’s manufacturing growth
slowed more than economists forecast in June, a report showed
today.  
 “It does not feel like the right moment to get in,” said
 Benno Galliker , a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in Lucerne,
Switzerland. “Europe is stuck in its own problems, while the
prospect of China slowing down is making investors nervous. I
don’t see real movement up during the summer.”  
 U.S. Economy  
 In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of
manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier.
Initial jobless claims increased by 13,000 in the week ended
June 26, Labor Department figures showed, while the National
Association of Realtors’ index of pending home resales dropped
30 percent in May from the prior month, more than twice as much
as forecast.  
 Richemont, the world’s biggest jewelry maker, tumbled 6.1
percent to 35.65 Swiss francs. Swatch, Switzerland’s biggest
watchmaker, dropped 4 percent to 294.2 francs. Holcim, the
world’s second-largest cement maker, dropped 3.8 percent to 70.1
francs.  
 UBS  fell 3 percent to 14.02 francs. The bank was urged by
two activist groups of shareholders to pursue former top
executives for their part in writedowns of more than $50 billion
of illiquid securities, the Wall Street Journal reported.
