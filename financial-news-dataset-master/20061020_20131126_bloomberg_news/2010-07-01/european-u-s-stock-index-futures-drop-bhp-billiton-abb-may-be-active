             European stocks  dropped to a five-
week low after reports that showed manufacturing growth slowed
in China and the U.S. and more Americans unexpectedly applied
for jobless benefits.  
 Daimler AG, the world’s second-biggest maker of luxury
cars, and HeidelbergCement AG led declines in shares tied to
economic growth.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the largest mining company,
and  Xstrata Plc  slid more than 3 percent as metal prices fell.
Chloride Group Plc retreated 4.1 percent after ABB Ltd.
abandoned its pursuit of the U.K. company.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  sank 2.5 percent to 237.3, the
lowest close since May 25. The benchmark gauge for European
equities has retreated 13 percent from this year’s high on April
15 and posted its first quarterly decline in more than a year in
the three months through June amid concern that Europe’s debt
crisis may derail the economic recovery.  
 “Fear, concern and uncertainty are in every corner of the
market,” said  Daniel Weston , Munich-based portfolio manager at
Schroeder Equities GmbH, which oversees about $105 million.
“There are limited reasons to be bullish, and negative
surprises in the data and in the news continue to support the
trade on the sell side.”  
 China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  dropped for a seventh
consecutive day as the nation’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell
to a lower-than-forecast 52.1 in June from 53.9 in May. A
reading of above 50 signals expansion.  
 U.S. Economy  
 In the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s  gauge of
manufacturing  fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a month earlier.
Initial jobless claims increased by 13,000 in the week ended
June 26, Labor Department figures showed, while the National
Association of Realtors’ index of pending home resales dropped
30 percent in May from the prior month, more than twice as much
as forecast.  
 “Everyone is running away every time we have bad news
coming from China,” said  Markus Wallner , senior equity
strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “The market will
still be very volatile in the next couple of months.
Macroeconomic numbers are a bit bumpy and a lot of leading
indicators have reached a peak.”  
 National benchmarks fell in all 18 western European markets
today, except for Greece. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 2.3 percent
and Germany’s DAX dropped 1.8 percent. France’s CAC 40 retreated
3 percent.  
 Spanish Bond Sale  
 Spain’s  IBEX 35  slid 0.9 percent as Moody’s Investors
Service said it may cut the nation’s top credit rating. The
gauge pared an earlier decline of as much as 3.1 percent after
the country sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of five-year
debt, reaching its a maximum target set in the auction.  
 Daimler and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG lost 3.6 percent to
40.42 euros and 4.7 percent to 38.20 euros, respectively.
 HeidelbergCement , the world’s third-largest cement manufacturer,
slid 5 percent to 37.23 euros.  
 BHP Billiton fell 3.4 percent to 1,694.5 pence and  Xstrata ,
the world’s largest thermal coal exporter, sank 4.6 percent to
845.8 pence. A measure of basic-resource companies sank 3.7
percent, the second-biggest drop among 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600, as copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all fell on the
London Metal Exchange.  
 Chloride Climbs  
 Chloride, the U.K.’s biggest maker of gear to protect
against power outages, slid 4.1 percent to 370.1 pence. ABB, the
world’s biggest supplier of power grids, relinquished the right
to match Emerson Electric Co.’s 997 million-pound ($1.5 billion)
offer for Chloride. ABB shares dropped 2 percent to 18.59 francs
in Zurich.  
 Societe Television Francaise 1 , France’s largest
broadcaster, and M6-Metropole Television SA retreated 5.2
percent to 10.22 euros and 3.2 percent to 16.18 euros,
respectively. The companies lost a bid to strike down European
Union approval of 150 million euros in French aid to state-run
broadcaster France Televisions SA.  
 Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA dropped 2.8 percent to
4.84 euros, the lowest close in almost a month. Portugal’s
biggest toll-road operator was downgraded to “underperform”
from “neutral” at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.  
 Ubisoft Entertainment SA  jumped 3.6 percent to 6.41 euros,
the biggest gain in seven weeks. Europe’s largest video-game
maker was raised to “buy” from “sell” at Deutsche Bank AG,
which said investors should focus on the fiscal year 2011 and
“should better appreciate the wide range of products
Ubisoft is likely to put on the market.”  
 BP Gains  
 BP Plc climbed 2.8 percent to 327.95 pence. Sky News
reported the European oil producer, battling to stop a leaking
oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, is in talks with China National
Offshore Oil Corp. regarding the sale of its 6 billion-pound
interests in Argentina.  
 Separately, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts said
BP’s first relief well for the leak may be completed in the
first half of July, ahead of the company’s indicated schedule.
The stock has fallen 50 percent since April 20 when an oil rig
explosion triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 Tate & Lyle Plc gained 1.1 percent to 454.4 pence as the
maker of low-calorie sweetener Splenda said it plans to sell its
sugars division to American Sugar Refining Inc. for 211 million
pounds.  
 Debenhams Plc soared 4 percent to 55.1 pence as the U.K.’s
second-largest department-store company said gross profit
margins for the year will exceed a previous forecast for a 0.8
percentage-point gain.
