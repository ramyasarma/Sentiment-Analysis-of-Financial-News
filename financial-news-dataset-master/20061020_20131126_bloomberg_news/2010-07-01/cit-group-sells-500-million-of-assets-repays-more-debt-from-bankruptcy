             CIT Group Inc. , the formerly bankrupt
small business lender run by  John A. Thain , said it sold $500
million of corporate assets, raised $800 million for customer
financing and completed a planned payment on first-lien debt.  
 The actions show “significant progress” in funding the
company and streamlining its portfolio, Thain said in a company
statement today.  
 CIT was reorganized in bankruptcy in December after being
unable to continue funding itself profitably with borrowings in
the capital markets. The company aims to develop a cheaper
source of funding, such as insured bank deposits. It is
currently limited by regulators from taking certain deposits.  
 CIT announced plans to make the $1.25 billion debt payment
in a June 24 filing. The New York-based company began the year
with $7.5 billion of first-lien debt out of $51.6 billion of
liabilities.  
 The $500 million of assets sold were “principally cash-
flow loans,” according to today’s statement. The company said
prices it got for the loans were greater than their value on its
books, without specifying the difference. It also completed a
previously announced sale of a vendor-financing business in
Australia.
