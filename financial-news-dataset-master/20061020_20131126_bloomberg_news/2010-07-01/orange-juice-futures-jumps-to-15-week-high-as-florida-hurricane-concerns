             Orange-juice futures jumped to a 15-
week high on mounting concern that citrus groves face an
increased risk of damage from hurricanes this season in Florida,
the world’s second-biggest grower.  
 The U.S. National Hurricane Center has projected 14 to 23
named storms forming before Nov. 30, more than average,
increasing the chance of lost fruit in Florida. Alex, the
earliest Atlantic hurricane since 1995, has been downgraded to a
tropical storm.  
 “People are a little nervous about the hurricanes,” said
 Sterling Smith , an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in St. Paul,
Minnesota. “The premium for the season is being priced in.”  
 Orange juice for September delivery rose 0.3 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $1.4865 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $1.516, the highest level for a most-
active contract since March 15. Yesterday, the commodity jumped
3.8 percent.  
 “This is speculative buying,” said  Jodi Timmons , a
trading adviser at Global Commodity Futures LLC in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.  
 As of June 22, hedge-fund managers and other large
speculators increased their net-long positions in orange-juice
futures by 26 percent from a week earlier, according to
government data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, outnumbered short positions by 10,050 contracts, the data
showed.  
 Florida’s Crop  
 Florida’s orange crop will fall 18 percent to 133.6 million
boxes in the harvest ending in July from 162.5 million boxes
last season, the U.S. government said last month. A box weighs
90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  
 The latest forecast would yield the  smallest crop  since
2007, when output tumbled to a 17-year low of 129 million boxes
because of hurricane damage.  
 Futures jumped 86 percent in the past year on concern that
supplies will trail demand. Prices often fluctuate on storm
forecasts during the Atlantic hurricane season that lasts
through November.  
 In the six months ended June 30, orange juice climbed 15
percent, the third-biggest gain behind coffee and hogs among 19
raw materials in the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  
 U.S. orange-juice sales fell 6.6 percent in the four weeks
ended June 12 from a year earlier, the Florida Department of
Citrus said this week. Retail prices rose 1.6 percent on average
to $5.62 a gallon, the agency said, citing Nielsen Co. data.  
 Brazil is the biggest orange grower.
