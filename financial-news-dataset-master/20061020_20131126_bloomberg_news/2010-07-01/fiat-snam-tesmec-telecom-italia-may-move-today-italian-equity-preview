             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index  fell
for a second day this week, declining 367.99, or 1.9 percent, to
18,943.76.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM), Italy’s largest independent
fund manager, dropped to its lowest price since July last year,
losing 43 cents, or 6.3 percent, to 6.40 euros as the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index fell to its lowest level in more than five
weeks.  
 Banca Generali SpA  (BGN IM), the asset-management arm of
Assicurazioni Generali SpA, declined 21.5 cents, or 2.7 percent,
to 7.67 euros.  
 Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM), Italy’s second-biggest cement
maker, dropped 24.5 cents, or 3 percent, to 8.04 euros, a third
consecutive loss. Gruppo Banca Leonardo cut its price estimate
to 9 euros from 10.20 euros on the shares and kept an
“underweight” recommendation. The brokerage said in a note
that it remains “cautious on the quite dull cement sector given
the uncertain macroeconomic development, especially in Europe.”  
 Italcementi SpA  (IT IM) sank 30 cents, or 4.8 percent, to
5.98 euros, its lowest price since October 1998. BofA Merrill
Lynch Global Research trimmed its price estimate on the ordinary
shares of Italy’s biggest cement maker to 6 euros from 7.80
euros and kept an “underperform” rating. The brokerage also
cut its recommendation on the savings shares to “underperform”
from “neutral.” The savings shares dropped 18 cents, or 5
percent, to 3.42 euros.  
 Fiat SpA  (F IM) dropped 33.5 cents, or 3.9 percent, to 8.18
euros as automobile stocks were the worst performers in Europe
today.  
 Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) plummeted 18.25 cents, or 3.9 percent,
to 4.51 euros, its lowest price since Nov. 5, as the broadcaster
owned by Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said it will cut pay-
television prices after rival Sky Italia SpA lowered its own
prices. The company also said that first-half advertising sales
in Italy rose 5 percent.  
 Snam Rete Gas SpA  (SRG IM) rose 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
3.35 euros, snapping a two-day loss. Morgan Stanley upgraded the
owner of Italy’s natural-gas grid to “overweight” from “equal
weight” and named the company as its “top European pick among
regulated names, which offer refuge amid rising uncertainty.”  
 Tesmec SpA  (TES IM) lost 14 euro cents, or 20 percent, to
56 cents. The maker of machines used to build and maintain power
lines and pipes started trading today at an initial public
offering price of 70 cents.  
 Tiscali SpA  (TIS IM) fell 0.5 euro cents, or 4.3 percent,
to 11 cents, a ninth straight loss. The phone and Internet
company had its price estimate cut to 15 cents from 22 cents at
Equita Sim SpA.  
 Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI IM) sank 2.55 euro
cents, or 4.6 percent, to 52.8 cents. Deutsche Bank AG cut its
price estimate on the insurer to 58 cents, saying that while the
company will “be able to deliver its 2012 business plan
targets, the market has already priced this in.”
