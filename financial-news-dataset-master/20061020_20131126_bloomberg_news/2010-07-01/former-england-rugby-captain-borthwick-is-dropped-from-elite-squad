             Ex-captain Steve Borthwick has been
dropped from England’s 32-man elite player squad for
the next rugby season, and is replaced by Dave Attwood.  
 Ugo Monye, Mathew Tait, Lee Mears and Louis Deacon are also
stepping down to the Saxons squad. Those added to the elite
group include Hendre Fourie and Paul Doran-Jones.  
 Borthwick, 30, has 57 caps for England, which came third in
this year’s Six Nations championship.  
 “Leaving Steve Borthwick out was a very hard
decision,” England manager Martin Johnson told the Rugby
Football Union  website . “He’s done a fantastic job for England
over the last couple of years and it’s the most difficult call
we’ve had to make. It is very tough on Steve but it goes to show
the depth of talent we’ve got in that area.”
