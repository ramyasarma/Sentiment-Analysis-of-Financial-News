             U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses after jobless claims unexpectedly increased last week,
fueling concern the employment market is struggling to recover.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September retreated 0.6 percent to 1,020.3 at 8:33 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 46 points, or
0.5 percent, to 9,670.    
 Initial jobless claims increased by 13,000 to 472,000 in
the week ended June 26, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The number of people receiving unemployment
insurance rose, while those getting emergency benefits dropped
after Congress failed to act on extending the legislation.  
 The S&P 500 has tumbled 15 percent from this year’s high on
April 23 on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
China’s moves to tame inflation will dent global growth. The
gauge is 7.6 percent lower this year and has fallen for seven of
the past eight days, trimming its valuation to about 15 times
the reported earnings of its companies, near the cheapest level
in a year, according to Bloomberg data.  
 China’s manufacturing growth slowed more than economists
forecast in June, adding to signs that the world’s fastest-
growing major economy is cooling. The government’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index fell to 52.1 in June from 53.9 in May. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists was
53.2. An HSBC Holdings Plc manufacturing index slid to a 14-
month low.  
 In the U.S., economic reports today and tomorrow may add to
evidence that growth is slowing. The Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index fell to 59 last month from 59.7 in
May, according to the median estimate of 79 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News before a report due at 10 a.m. New York time.
Figures from the Commerce Department at the same time will show
construction spending fell 0.8 percent in May after a gain of
2.7 percent the prior month, according to the median estimate.
Another report may show the number of contracts to buy
previously owned homes dropped in May.
