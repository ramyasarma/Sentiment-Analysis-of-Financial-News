             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , the
largest bank owned by the U.K. government, sold London’s
Cumberland Hotel to  London & Regional Properties Ltd.  and
Starwood Capital Group LLC to reduce its investment in hotels.  
 The transaction closed yesterday, RBS spokeswoman Aoife
Reynolds said in a telephone interview today. Reynolds declined
to confirm a report in Property Week magazine that the closely
held purchasers paid almost 215 million pounds ($324 million)
for the 1,019-bedroom hotel at Marble Arch in central London.  
 RBS, which is 84 percent-owned by the government, also
plans to sell the 494-bedroom Grosvenor House Hotel about a mile
away on London’s Park Lane. That may fetch as much as 500
million pounds, the Wall Street Journal said March 3.  
 The bank bought both hotels in 2001 as part of a sale-and-
leaseback transaction with Le Meridien, a hotel group owned by
Nomura International’s Principal Finance Group.  
 London & Regional, which is owned by brothers Ian and
 Richard Livingstone , owns three Hilton-operated hotels in
central London, including one on Park Lane. The others are in
Trafalgar Square and in Mayfair.  
 Starwood Capital , a private investment firm based in
Greenwich, Connecticut, was founded by  Barry S. Sternlicht , the
founder of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc.  
 Malaysian billionaire  Quek Leng Chan , one of whose
companies operates the Cumberland, withdrew his bid for the
hotel on the day the transaction was due to close, the London
 Evening Standard  reported May 28.
