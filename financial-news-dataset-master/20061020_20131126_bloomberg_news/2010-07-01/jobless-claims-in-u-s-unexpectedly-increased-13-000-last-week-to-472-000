             More Americans unexpectedly applied
for  jobless benefits  last week, a sign the labor market recovery
may be slowing.  
 Initial jobless claims increased by 13,000 to 472,000 in
the week ended June 26, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The number of people  receiving  unemployment
insurance rose, while those getting emergency benefits dropped
after Congress failed to act on extending the legislation.  
 The jump in applications raises the risk that the turmoil
in financial markets brought on by the European debt crisis is
leading to additional cutbacks in staff. The Labor Department
tomorrow may report the U.S. lost jobs in June for the first
month this year, reflecting a drop in temporary federal workers
who helped to conduct the decennial census.  
 “The labor market is not generating employment for anyone,
even for people who have been out a long time,” said  Steven Ricchiuto , chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New
York, who forecast claims at 470,000. “What we’re seeing in the
backup of claims is not a particularly healthy story, showing we
can’t generate upside momentum in the labor market.”  
 Economists forecast jobless applications would fall to
455,000 from an initially reported 457,000 for the prior week,
according to the median of 46 projections in a Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 440,000 to 475,000.  
 Stock-Index Futures  
 Stock-index futures extended losses and Treasury securities
were little changed after the report. Futures on the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index  expiring in September dropped 0.4 percent to
1,022.8 at 8:45 a.m. in New York. The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note rose was 2.93 percent, the same as late yesterday.  
 This is the time of year when states cut back on payrolls
in schools, a Labor Department spokesman said. The jump in
claims may reflect even larger-than-typical reductions.  
 Another report today showed job cuts announced by U.S.
employers fell in June.  Planned firings  dropped 47 percent to
39,358 from 74,393 in June 2009, according to figures released
by Chicago-based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. It was the
third straight month that announced reductions totaled less than
40,000. For the first half of the year, announced job cuts
totaled 297,677, the lowest six-month tally since 2000.  
 Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  
 Four-Week Average  
 The  four-week moving  average, a less volatile measure than
the weekly figures, climbed to 466,500, the highest level since
March, from 463,250 the prior week, today’s report showed.  
 The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
increased by 43,000 in the week ended June 19 to 4.62 million.  
 The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended or emergency benefits under federal
programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and
are now collecting emergency and extended payments plunged by
about 376,000 to 4.92 million in the week ended June 12.  
 The Labor Department estimates about 3.3 million people
will fall off extended-benefit rolls by the end of July if
Congress doesn’t pass emergency legislation.  
 The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3.6 percent in
the week ended June 19.  
 Forty states and territories reported a decrease in claims,
while 13 reported an increase. These data are also reported with
a one-week lag.  
 Employment Forecast  
 The Labor Department tomorrow may report payrolls fell by
125,000 in June, reflecting cuts in temporary census workers as
the decennial survey nears completion, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast. Private payrolls, which are more revealing
of labor-market conditions, probably rose by 110,000 after a
41,000 gain the prior month.  
 A report yesterday showed companies added 13,000 workers to
payrolls in June, the smallest gain since February, according to
figures from ADP Employer Services. Economists surveyed had
forecast a gain of 60,000, according to a Bloomberg survey
median estimate.  
 The economy lost 8.4 million jobs during the recession that
began in December 2007, the biggest employment slump in the
post-World War II era. From January through May, company
payrolls grew by 495,000 workers.  
 Federal Reserve  
 Federal Reserve  policy makers last week reiterated a pledge
to keep the benchmark interest at a record low for an “extended
period” and signaled the fallout from the European debt crisis
poised a risk for economic growth. They acknowledged the labor
market was “improving gradually,” even as employers are
reluctant to boost hiring.  
 The timing of the traditional summer auto-plant shutdowns
to retool equipment for new models may reduce claims in coming
weeks.  
 General Motors Co. said June 17 most of its U.S. plants
will remain open during the traditional shutdowns, a move that
economists said could lower claims because some temporarily
suspended workers usually apply for benefits.
