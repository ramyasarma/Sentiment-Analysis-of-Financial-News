             New Zealand’s government forecasts
tourist arrivals will increase by an average of 3.5 percent a
year through 2016, buoyed by the Rugby World Cup and a global
economic recovery.  
 International arrivals will exceed 3 million for the first
time in 2015, a year earlier than projected previously, the
Ministry of Tourism said in its annual forecasts published today
on its website.  
 Spending by visitors and the provision of tourism services
contributes about 10 percent to New Zealand’s $130 billion
economy and is a key source of income for  Air New Zealand Ltd. ,
the nation’s largest airline. Globally, international arrivals
increased by 7 percent in the first four months of 2010, the
 World Tourism Organization  said this week.  
 “The sector is highly resilient and has weathered the
recession very well,” Associate Tourism Minister  Jonathan Coleman  said in a statement. “We can look forward to some good
growth.”  
 Arrivals in New Zealand this year will rise 3.7 percent
from 2009, when they were unchanged, today’s report showed.  
 The government agency is forecasting a 6.8 percent surge in
arrivals in 2011 when New Zealand hosts the Rugby World Cup.
Total arrivals in 2011 will be 2,709,000 or 152,000 more than
forecast in last year’s report.  
 Total spending by foreign visitors is forecast to rise an
average of 4 percent a year, the report showed. That includes a
forecast 10 percent surge in 2011 as rugby fans arrive.
