             Investors are buying into U.S.
Treasuries as optimism wanes about the global economic recovery,
creating “the worst kind” of declines in yields for both long-
and short-term bonds, according to Anthony Crescenzi, an
investor at Pacific Investment Management Co., the
world’s largest mutual-fund manager.  
 “Investors have become less optimistic about the outlook
for both the U.S. and global economy, enough so to alter
expectations about the outlook on both inflation and monetary
policy,” Crescenzi said today in an e-mailed note. This has led
to a “bull flattening of the so-called yield curve that is
‘‘the worst kind’’ of flattening, he said.
