             The ruble weakened for the second day
this week versus the dollar as oil slipped below $75 a barrel
and concern deepened Chinese economic growth will slow.  
 Russia’s currency declined 0.5 percent versus the greenback
to 31.3970 as of 10:09 a.m. in Moscow. The government’s
benchmark dollar bonds due April 2020 rose, sending the yield 1
basis point lower to 5.44 percent.  
 Crude oil, Russia’s main export, slipped as much as 1.3
percent to $74.63 a barrel in New York. China’s manufacturing
expanded at a reduced pace for a second month in June, adding to
signs the fastest growing major economy is cooling.  
 Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
31.5980 per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of
31.4545 yesterday. The contracts are a guide to expectations of
currency movements as they allow foreign investors and companies
to fix the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble was little changed against the euro at 38.3440.
Those movements left it 0.3 percent weaker at 34.5207 against
the central bank’s  target  currency basket, which is used to
manage swings that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
