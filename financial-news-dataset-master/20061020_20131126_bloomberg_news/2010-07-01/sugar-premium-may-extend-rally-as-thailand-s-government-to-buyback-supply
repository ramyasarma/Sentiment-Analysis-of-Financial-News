             Thai sugar premiums over benchmark
grades in New York and London may extend a rally as the
government plans to buy back the commodity from traders to meet
rising local consumption, an industry group said.  
 “Thai premiums of both raw and white sugar are likely to
rise further” as one more buyer steps in amid tight supply,
 Vibul Panitvong , executive chairman of Thai Sugar Millers Corp.,
a group of 46 millers, said in an interview yesterday. “There
is nearly no supply available. Most sugar has been committed.”  
 Thailand, the second largest exporter, plans to repurchase
100,000 metric tons from traders to meet rising domestic demand,
 Prasert Tapaneeyangkul , secretary-general of the  Office of the
Cane and Sugar Board , said yesterday. The nation’s output may
decline as much as 13 percent in the next crop year as delayed
rain and subsequent floods will likely damage cane crops, the
board said June 25.  
 “We target to buy back Thai-origin sugar which has been
sold but not yet delivered,” Prasert said. As much as 800,000
tons hasn’t been shipped and “at the moment, there’s no need
to import from other destinations,” he said.  
 The Thai raw sugar cash premium over the New York contract
is at about 4.5 cent to 5 cents a pound, Vibul said. It reached
a record of 6 cents a pound in May. The Thai white sugar
premium is at a record $110 a ton over the London contract, he
added.  
 The raw premium was about 0.3 to 0.5 cents a pound when
the futures climbed to a 29-year high of 30.4 cents on Feb. 1.
The white premium was about $5 to $10 a ton when prices touched
a peak of $759 on Jan. 21, Piromsak Sasunee, chief executive of
the top exporter, Thai Sugar Trading Corp., said June 25.  
 Exports to Drop  
 Thailand will increase the amount of domestic sugar output
set aside for consumption by 4.5 percent to 2.3 million tons to
ease tight supplies, Prasert said June 25. Falling output and
rising demand will further pare exports in 2011 to below the
4.6 million tons expected for this year, he said.  
 Raw-sugar prices have tumbled 50 percent from the Feb. 1
peak as hedge-and index-fund managers cut holdings and on signs
that production from Brazil and India, the top producers, will
improve. The most-active contract more than doubled last year.  
 Futures for October delivery gained 5.1 percent to 16.06
cents a pound in New York yesterday. White sugar climbed 2.5
percent to $469.30 a ton on the Liffe exchange in London.
