             Chrysler Group LLC may report June
U.S. vehicle sales that gained more than 33 percent from a year
earlier, exceeding analysts’ estimates, a person familiar with
the results said.  
 Last June, Chrysler sold 68,297 cars and trucks. A 33
percent increase would indicate at least sales of 90,835
vehicles. Chrysler’s June sales didn’t exceed the 104,819
deliveries in May, the person said. The 33 percent forecast is
the average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Industrywide  deliveries  in June were expected to reach an
annualized rate of 11.2 million vehicles, the average estimate
of eight analysts. That would be an increase from last year’s
9.7 million-unit pace and a drop from 11.6 million in May. Other
automakers are scheduled to report U.S. sales later today.  
 Annual auto deliveries averaged 16.8 million from 2000
through 2007 and fell to 10.4 million last year, the lowest in
27 years.  
 Deliveries of all four of Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
Chrysler’s brands gained, the person said.
