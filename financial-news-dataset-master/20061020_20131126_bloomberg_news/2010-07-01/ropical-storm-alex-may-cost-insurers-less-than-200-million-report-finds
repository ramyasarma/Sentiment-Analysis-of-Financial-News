             Tropical storm Alex, which at its
peak was the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2010 season, may
cost insurers less than $200 million, according to catastrophe-
modeling firm AIR Worldwide.  
 The estimate covers possible wind and flood damage to
properties in Mexico, the Boston-based firm said today in a
 statement . The storm hit a thinly populated area with few
insured properties, Tim Doggett, principal scientist at AIR,
said in the statement.  
 “Alex’s overall impact in terms of wind damage will be
less than anticipated,” Doggett said. “The full extent and
possible effects of expected flooding, however, remain
uncertain.”  
 Alex is losing power after coming ashore overnight in
Mexico and forcing the shutdown of a quarter of the U.S.’s Gulf
oil production. Alex had reached Category 2 storm status with
winds of 100 mph (161 kph).
