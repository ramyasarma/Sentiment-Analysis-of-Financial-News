             At least 35 people were killed and
175 were injured when two suicide bombers blew themselves up at
the shrine of a Sufi saint in Pakistan’s eastern city of Lahore.  
 The attacks took place inside the tomb of the Persian Sufi
saint Syed Abul Hassan Bin Usman Bin Ali Al-Hajweri when it was
crowded with worshippers who gather every Thursday for special
rituals, Khusro Pervez, Lahore’s commissioner, told reporters.
The heads of both suicide bombers were found by police, he said.  
 Yesterday’s bombings in Lahore, Pakistan’s cultural capital,
come a month after over 100 people were killed in twin attacks
on mosques of the minority Ahmadi community in the city on May
28. At least 550 people have been killed in retaliatory attacks
by militants in cities nationwide after Pakistan’s military
started operations in the northwest last year.  
 The attacks on the shrine took place at 11:20 p.m.,
according to the Edhi Rescue Service. Hardline religious
militants oppose followers of the Sufi interpretation of Islam,
a moderate belief system based on mysticism.  
 Riots broke out in parts of Lahore as people protested the
bombings, GEO television reported.
