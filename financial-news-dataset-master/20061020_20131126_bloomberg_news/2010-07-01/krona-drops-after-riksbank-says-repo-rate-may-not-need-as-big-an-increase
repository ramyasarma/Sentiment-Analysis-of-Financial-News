             The Swedish krona weakened against
the euro after the Riksbank said its repo rate won’t need to be
increased as much as previously assumed.  
 The krona fell 0.4 percent to 9.5687 per euro as of 9:34
a.m. in Stockholm.  
 The Swedish central bank also raised its main rate by a
quarter point to 0.50 percent, matching a median prediction by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
