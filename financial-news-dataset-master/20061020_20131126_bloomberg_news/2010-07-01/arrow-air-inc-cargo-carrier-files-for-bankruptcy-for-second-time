             Arrow Air Inc., a cargo carrier,
filed for bankruptcy after shutting down all scheduled service
operations and ceased flying.  
 The company listed debt of as much as $500 million and
assets of as much as $50 million in Chapter 11 documents filed
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami where it is based. Arrow Air
Holdings Corp. also sought protection.  
 “After exhausting all viable potential purchasers and
investors, the debtors made the difficult decision to cease
scheduled service operations in order to preserve the existing
value of their estates,”  Doug Yakola , chief restructuring
officer of Arrow Air, said in court papers.  
 Arrow and Arrow Air Holdings Corp. emerged from bankruptcy
in June 2004 through a confirmed plan of reorganization.  
 Arrow is “maintaining the airline operating authorities
and the potential for undertaking charter flying in the event a
potential purchaser can be consummated in Chapter 11,” Yakola
said.  
 The case is In re Arrow Air Inc., 10-28831, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of Florida (Miami).
