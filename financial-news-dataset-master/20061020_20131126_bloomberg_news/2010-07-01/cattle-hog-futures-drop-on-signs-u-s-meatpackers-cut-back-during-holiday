             Hog futures fell for the third time
this week on speculation that U.S. meatpackers will slow
livestock purchases as they cut back on slaughtering for the
Independence Day holiday on July 4. Cattle were steady.  
 Some grocers may wait until next week to restock shelves
with pork and beef, said  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at
Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois.  Spot-market hog 
prices are down 1.6 percent this week and  cattle  are little
changed, as meatpacker demand slumps, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  
 “With the long weekend, packer activity is diminishing
rapidly,” Kane said. Food retailers “bought already for the
Fourth of July, so everybody is waiting and seeing what
disappears, before they look next week to see what they need to
buy.”  
 Hog futures for August settlement dropped 0.2 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 81.45 cents a pound at 11:32 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Futures declined 1.5 percent in the three
months ended yesterday, the first drop in three quarters.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.075 cent to 89.95
cents a pound on the CME. The most-active contract dropped 3.8
percent in the second quarter, the first decline in five
quarters. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.375
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $1.12675 a pound.  
 Livestock futures pared losses as the dollar dropped,
raising speculation that U.S. meat exports will increase.  
 The  dollar  sank to a seven-week low today against a basket
of six major currencies. The U.S. sold 21 percent more beef to
overseas buyers in the four weeks ended June 24 than a year
earlier, the USDA said today.  
 “For the countries that do have some money, the cheaper
dollar makes our meat look a little more viable,” Kane said.  
 Wholesale  choice beef  fell 0.1 percent at midday to $1.5536
a pound, the first drop this week. Wholesale  pork  prices have
dropped 2.9 percent in the past four sessions to 81.8 cents a
pound yesterday, the lowest level since June 16.
