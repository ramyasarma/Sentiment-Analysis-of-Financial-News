             Doosan Heavy Industries &
Construction Co. , South Korea’s biggest power-equipment maker,
signed a record $3.9 billion contract to provide nuclear
reactors in the United Arab Emirates, the company said in a
statement. Shares rose to their highest in two months.  
 The Changwon, South Korea-based company will supply
nuclear reactors, turbines and other equipment to  Korea
Electric Power Corp. , which is leading a group that won a
$18.6 billion order to build nuclear power plants for the
U.A.E.  
 Korea Electric agreed in December to build four nuclear
plants by 2020 for the Persian Gulf nation, which is turning
to atomic power to meet growing energy demand as
industrialization depletes natural-gas supplies. The contract
was South Korea’s first overseas nuclear order.  
 Doosan Heavy  rose as much as 4.4 percent to 78,900 won,
the highest since April 30, in Seoul trading. The stock
traded at 76,400 won at 9:52 a.m. local time. The benchmark
Kospi index fell 0.6 percent.
