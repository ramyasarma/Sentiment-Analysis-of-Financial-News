             The rand slumped to a three-week low
after manufacturing slowed in South Africa and its export
markets and the country braced itself for a possible power-
utility strike threatening to hobble industrial output.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy lost as much as
1.7 percent to 7.7839 per dollar, the weakest intraday level
since June 10. The rand was 1.1 percent down at 7.7428 per
dollar at 4:40 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a close of 7.6566
yesterday. Against the euro, the rand retreated 3.1 percent.  
 South Africa’s  purchasing managers’ index  slid to 48.4,
less than 50 for the first time in eight months in June,
indicating a contraction in industrial output, Kagiso Securities
Ltd. said.  PMI  for China, the world’s fastest-growing major
 economy , and a gauge of factory output in the 16-member euro
region weakened for a second month, separate surveys showed. In
the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing
gauge fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 in May.  
 The South African PMI figure “is quite significant as it
was expected to be about 53 and the actual number did bode
negatively toward the rand,”  Brigid Taylor , a senior currency
dealer at Rand Merchant Bank, said by telephone from
Johannesburg. “The concern is that the growth trajectory in
China may be posing a threat to the global recovery and
sentiment is relatively negative.”  
 The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa rejected
a revised pay offer from Eskom Holdings Ltd., which produces
about 95 percent of the country’s power, while the National
Union of Mineworkers said it will serve a strike notice on the
company.  
 Disappointing Data  
 “Disappointing manufacturing data out of China and
indications that Eskom workers could go on strike next week,
explains why the rand is weaker,”  Michael Keenan , a currency
strategist at  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in
a research note. “Risky assets, to which the rand remains
highly correlated, have come under renewed selling pressure.”  
 Commodities account for about half of South Africa’s total
export earnings, according to data from the country’s Department
of Mineral Resources.  
 The rand weakened 3.1 percent versus the euro to 9.6750,
the biggest drop since May 19.  
 Government bonds rose for a second day, with the 13.5
percent security due September 2015 rising 34 cents to 123.09
rand. The yield on the bond fell 7 basis points to 7.97 percent.  
 Investors increased bets the central bank will lower its
6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next meets on July
22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month
contracts  for cash in three months fell 2 basis points to 6.41
percent. The rate reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on
April 21.
