             Gartner Inc. lowered its growth
forecast for worldwide spending on information technology this
year to 3.9 percent, from a prediction of 5.3 percent, citing
problems in euro area economies.  
 The falling euro and austerity measures to counter the
sovereign debt crisis will reduce dollar spending, the research
firm said in an e-mailed press release. Hardware will lead
spending growth with a 9.1 percent increase, while software,
services and telecommunications will advance at lower rates,
Gartner said.  
 “Chief information officers see only marginal increases in
budgets and are constrained to essential spending, with
discretionary spending still on hold,” Gartner analyst  Richard Gordon  said in the release.
