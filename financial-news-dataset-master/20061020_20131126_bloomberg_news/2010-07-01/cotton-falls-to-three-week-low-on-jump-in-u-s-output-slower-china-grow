             Cotton fell to a three-week low on
concern that U.S. production will surge as economic growth slows
in China, the world’s largest user of the fiber.  
 Farmers in the U.S., the top exporter, boosted planting by
19 percent this year, the biggest jump in four years, the
government said yesterday. China’s manufacturing slowed more
than forecast in June, a National Bureau of Statistics survey
showed today. The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index of 19 commodities
fell to a three-week low.  
 “Cotton is falling because of the increasing size of the
crop, and because we believe we are also going to have a big
crop overseas,” said  Sharon Johnson , a senior analyst at First
Capitol Group LLC in Atlanta.  
 Cotton for December delivery declined 0.63 cent, or 0.8
percent, to 75.75 cents a pound at 1:33 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, after touching 75.17 cents, the lowest level for
the most-active contract since June 7.  
 Farmers sowed 10.909 million acres (4.41 million hectares)
this season, up from 9.15 million acres a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. On June 10, the USDA’s
Foreign Agricultural Service estimated global production will
increase 11 percent in the marketing year beginning Aug. 1.  
 In the week ended June 24, U.S. exporters sold 116,700
bales for delivery before Sept. 1, down 61 percent from the
previous four-week average, the USDA said today in a  report .  
 China’s Economy  
 The Chinese government’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index 
declined for a second month in June, falling to 52.1 from 53.9
in May. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 12
economists was 53.2. An HSBC Holdings Plc manufacturing index
slid to a 14-month low.  
 “There are concerns that this slowdown will infringe on
cotton consumption,” Johnson said.  
 Equities fell in Asia, the U.S. and Europe on concern that
an economic slowdown will impede the global recovery. The
Shanghai Composite Average is down for the seventh straight day,
after touching a 14-month low yesterday.
