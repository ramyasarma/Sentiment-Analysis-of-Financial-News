             Mosaic Oil NL  jumped the most in more
than 20 years in Sydney trading after AGL Energy Ltd.,
Australia’s largest electricity retailer, made a takeover offer
for the oil and gas producer.  
 Mosaic  rose  67 percent, the most since the shares started
trading on March 31, 1989, to 13 Australian cents. It settled at
the highest close since Oct. 15, valuing the company at A$107
million ($89 million). That compares with a 1.5 percent decline
in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  
 AGL Energy  is offering 15 cents cash per share, or 1.01 of
its own stock for every 100 Mosaic shares, the Sydney-based
electricity retailer said in a statement. As of June 30, AGL had
acquired 105 million Mosaic shares, giving it a 12.8 percent
stake, it said in a separate statement.  
 AGL wants to buy Mosaic to gain its depleted Silver Springs
gas fields in Queensland, which AGL intends to develop into a
gas storage facility for BG Group Plc, AGL Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Fraser  said in the statement.  
 The project would provide BG’s Queensland Gas Co. unit with
gas storage for seven years, AGL said. AGL expects the project
to be operational by April.  
 Mosaic hasn’t considered the proposal and will meet with
 AGL Energy  to discuss it, the company said. Shareholders should
take no action, Mosaic said.
