             Triumph Power Generating Co. said it
will ask Kenya’s energy regulator for permission to start an 80-
megawatt power project in Athi-River, about 35 kilometers (22
miles) south of the capital, Nairobi.  
 “The purpose for which the license is required is to
enable the applicant to generate and supply electrical energy in
bulk to  Kenya Power and Lighting Co. ,” the Nairobi-based
company said in a statement published today in the Daily Nation
newspaper. The plant would use turbines powered by heavy fuel
oil, according to the statement.
