                  July 1 (Bloomberg) --- Maputo international airport’s
passenger terminal won’t be handed over until September, three
months after the agreed date, the Noticias reported, citing
Transport and Communication Minister Paulo Zucula.  
 The delay was due to “rectification of anomalies” which
were detected on inspection of the project, Zucula told the
Maputo-based newspaper.
