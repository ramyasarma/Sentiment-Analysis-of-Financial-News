             ABB Ltd ., the world’s biggest power
grid supplier, abandoned its pursuit of  Chloride Group Plc  to
avoid escalating a bidding contest with  Emerson Electric Co .  
 ABB relinquished its right to match Emerson’s 997 million-
pound ($1.5 billion) offer for London-based Chloride, the Swiss
engineering company said in a statement today. Emerson’s June 29
offer of 375 pence per share compared with ABB’s 325 pence bid,
which was initially accepted by Chloride management.  
 “One of the criteria was ABB wouldn’t overpay and it seems
that they are sticking strictly to that,” said  Richard Frei , an
analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank. “I positively interpret this
as taking a disciplined approach, and not risk aversion.”  
 Zurich-based ABB, whose cash reserves swelled to $9.4
billion in March, saw the acquisition of Chloride as a way to
enter the market for equipment to protect against power outages.
St. Louis, Missouri-based Emerson is already active in that
market, and has outlined annual operating cost savings of at
least 33 million pounds after a deal, through purchasing savings
and cutting Chloride’s  workforce  and plants.  
 Chloride, in a separate statement, said it’s entering talks
with Emerson. Its shares fell 4 percent to 370.5 pence in London
as of 8:03 a.m. local time. ABB slipped 1.6 percent to 18.67
Swiss francs.  
 Risk Averse  
 “We must take a disciplined approach when assessing
potential acquisitions,” ABB Chief Executive Officer  Joe Hogan 
said in the statement.  
 Emerson was initially spurned by Chloride management, yet
returned with a sweetened proposal, forcing ABB to make its
move. Prior to that, Hogan said he had been discussing
opportunities for cooperation with his counterpart at Chloride
over an 18 month period.  
 Hogan took over ABB in 2008 with a track record of deal
making at General Electric Co., where as an executive he made
the company’s then-biggest purchase, buying Amersham Plc for
about $10 billion in 2004. Before considering acquisitions at
ABB, Hogan accelerated an overhaul of the power-grid maker to
save $3 billion in 2010.  
 ABB will get a “breakup fee” of about $12.8 million from
Chloride, said  Wolfram Eberhardt , a spokesman for the Swiss
company. The result of a merger of BBC Brown Boveri of
Switzerland and ASEA AB of Sweden in 1988, ABB still has an
appetite for more purchases, though it’s committed to an
investment grade credit rating, Chief Financial Officer  Michel Demare  said on a call June 8.  
 An acquisition would have been a “nice-to-have add-on,”
though there are other opportunities for ABB to expand, Zuercher
Kantonalbank’s Frei said.
