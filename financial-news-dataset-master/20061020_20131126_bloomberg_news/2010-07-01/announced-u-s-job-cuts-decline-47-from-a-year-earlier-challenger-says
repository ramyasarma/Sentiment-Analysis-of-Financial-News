             Job cuts announced by U.S. employers
fell in June, a sign companies have enough business to retain
current staff levels.  
 Planned firings  dropped 47 percent to 39,358 from 74,393 in
June 2009, according to figures released today by Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. It was the third straight
month that announced reductions totaled less than 40,000.  
 Announced job cuts for the first half of the year totaled
297,677, the lowest six-month tally since 2000. Labor market
improvement is needed to support  consumer spending  and the
economy as it tries to withstand challenges from the turmoil in
financial markets and resumed weakness in housing.  
 “The dramatic decline in planned layoffs over the past six
months certainly suggests that the nation’s employers are not
anticipating a double-dip recession,”  John Challenger , chief
executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a
statement. “Hiring will accelerate in the coming months, but
not before employers maximize the productivity of their existing
workers.”  
 Employers announced plans to hire 11,732 workers.
Transportation companies and makers of industrial goods led the
gains, with 3,310 and 2,362 positions announced, respectively.  
 While firings may be slowing, recent data indicate hiring
has yet to pick up. A report yesterday from ADP Employer
Services showed private payrolls rose by 13,000 in June, the
smallest gain in four months and lower than economists’
projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Payroll Forecast  
 A Labor Department report tomorrow may show the U.S. lost
125,000 jobs in June, reflecting a drop in federal census
workers as the decennial population count began to wind down,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Payrolls at private companies were forecast to rise 110,000,
according to the survey.  
 Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies, and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  
 The number of planned job cuts increased 1.4 percent in
June from 38,810 in May, today’s report showed. The figures
aren’t adjusted for seasonal effects, so economists prefer to
focus on year-over-year changes rather than monthly numbers.  
 Computer makers led the reductions last month, with 9,085
announced cuts. Government and non-profit agencies followed with
5,306. Hewlett-Packard Co., the world’s largest personal-
computer maker, said June 1 that it plans to cut about 9,000
jobs.  
 California led all states with 14,078 announced job cuts,
followed by New York, with 6,940.
