             Investors should bet that longer-term
interest rates will rise faster than short-dated ones as central
banks maintain low interest rates as the recovery takes hold,
according to Morgan Stanley.  
 Five-year notes will perform best, making the most
profitable trades to buy them against 10-year and 30-year bonds,
fixed-income strategists led by  Jim Caron  in New York wrote in a
research report dated yesterday. Five-year rates will fall
relative to two-year ones, they said.  
 “Economic stability is an underpriced risk that we believe
will be the surprise for the market in the second half of the
year as it ignites an asset reflation trade,” the strategists
said. “Much of the double dip and deflation fears are already
priced. European sovereigns muddle along and the risk premium
assigned to them declines. This will allow the forces associated
with global growth to reassert themselves, producing higher
yields and steeper curves.”  
 The  premium  that investors demand to hold 10-year U.S.
Treasuries over five-year notes narrowed one basis point to 115
basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in London. The so-called yield
spread was at 137 basis points on March 9.
