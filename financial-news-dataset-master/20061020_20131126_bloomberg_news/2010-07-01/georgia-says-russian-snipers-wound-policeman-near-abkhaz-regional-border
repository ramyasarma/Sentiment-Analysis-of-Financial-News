             Georgia’s government said Russian
snipers in the breakaway region of Abkhazia opened fire on
police in the border city of Ganmukhuri, wounding one officer.  
 The snipers started shooting late yesterday, aided by a
drone, the Interior Ministry said on its website. Georgian
forces didn’t return fire, the ministry said. Rustavi 2
television showed video of what it said was a Russian drone
patrolling the border.  
 An official in the press service of the Russian Defense
Ministry’s North Caucasus unit said by phone from Rostov-on-Don
that she had no knowledge of the incident, declining to be
identified in line with military policy.
