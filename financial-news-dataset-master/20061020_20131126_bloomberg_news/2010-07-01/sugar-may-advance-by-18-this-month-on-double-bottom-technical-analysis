             Sugar prices may surge 18 percent by
the end of this month after hitting a “double bottom” in May
and June, said  Spencer Patton , the founder and chief investment
officer of Steel Vine Investments LLC.  
 Raw sugar may climb to 19 cents a pound by the end of July
after falling below 14 cents on May 7 and June 2, Patton said. A
double bottom is a chart pattern showing a drop in price,
followed by a rebound and then another decline to the same
level, usually indicating support.  
 “The market was oversold,” Patton said. “The chart
points to the market rising higher this month.”  
 Sugar plunged 57 percent to 13 cents on May 7 from a 29-
year high of 30.4 cents on Feb. 1. Buyers delayed purchases on
speculation that higher output in Brazil and India, the world’s
biggest producers, will erase a supply deficit and drive costs
down.  
 Yesterday, raw sugar for October delivery jumped 0.78 cent,
or 5.1 percent, to 16.06 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. The most-active contract climbed 13 percent in June.  
 “We are gradually seeing buyers return as end-customers
see value at these prices,” Patton said.  
 In 2009, Patton opened Chicago-based Steel Vine, which
invests mostly in commodities and equities. He previously worked
for KPAC Solutions, a private equity firm.
