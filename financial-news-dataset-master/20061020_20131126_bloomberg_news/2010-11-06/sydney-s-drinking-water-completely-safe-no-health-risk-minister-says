Sydney’s residents have been assured
that the city’s drinking water remains “completely safe for
consumption and poses absolutely no health risk,” New South
Wales Water Minister Phil Costa said in an e-mailed statement.  Human error led to incorrect reporting of levels of E.coli
in Sydney Water’s Quarterly Drinking Water Quality report, the
statement said.  “I can assure Sydney residents that the drinking water
from the desalination plant is completely safe,” Costa said. “I
cannot say it more plainly -- the water from Sydney’s
desalination plant is completely safe to drink, no question
about it.”   Costa said Sydney Water will investigate the mistake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
