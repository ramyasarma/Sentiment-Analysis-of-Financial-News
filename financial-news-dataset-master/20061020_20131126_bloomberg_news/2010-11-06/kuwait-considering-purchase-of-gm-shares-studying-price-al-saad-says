Kuwait is considering whether to buy
shares in General Motors Co. when the company makes an initial
public offering, now that the price range has been announced,
said  Bader al-Saad , managing director of the country’s sovereign
wealth fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority.  “We will look into that, we have to review that, if it’s
feasible to us we are interested,” he told reporters today in
Kuwait City, where he is attending a summit of Gulf Cooperation
Council finance ministers and central bank governors. “If
something is cheap, we are interested, of course.”  The KIA should complete its evaluation of the planned IPO
around Nov. 17, al-Saad said.  GM is seeking to sell 365 million shares at $26 to $29 each
in the IPO, which may reduce the U.S. Treasury Department’s
stake in the company to 43 percent from 61 percent, according to
a regulatory filing on Nov. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
