China will adopt policies to spur
production of grain and oilseed under its 2011-2015 Five-Year
Plan, the farm ministry said.  The government will also enhance the pricing mechanism for
grain and oilseed products, and seek ways to boost market
controls for smaller agricultural commodities including produce,
Song Hongyuan, a ministry researcher, said at a conference in
Guangzhou today.  China will work with industry associations to improve its
management of agricultural imports and exports, Song said
without elaborating.  -- William Bi . Editors: Jim McDonald  To contact the reporter on this story:
