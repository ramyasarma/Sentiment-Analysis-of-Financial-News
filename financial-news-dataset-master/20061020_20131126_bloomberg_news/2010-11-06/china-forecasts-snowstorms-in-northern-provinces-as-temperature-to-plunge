China’s northern provinces will
experience snow in the next three days as a cold front reduces
temperature in the region by as much as 10 degrees Celsius (50
degrees Fahrenheit), said the China Meteorological
Administration.  The eastern parts of northeastern China will have
snowstorms, the weather agency said in a statement on its
 website  today. Some areas in Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong and
Hainan will have rain today, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
