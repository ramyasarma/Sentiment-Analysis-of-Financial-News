There was no evidence of an explosion
in the Sept. 3 crash of a  United Parcel Service Inc.  plane in
Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ General Civil Aviation
Authority said after al-Qaeda claimed it bombed the Boeing Co.
747-400, whose two pilots were killed.  The GCAA will take seriously any claims of responsibility,
the agency said in an e-mailed statement today without naming
al-Qaeda specifically.  Al-Qaeda’s branch in Yemen said it was behind the crash of
the UPS plane and the planting of two bombs discovered Oct. 29
in printer cartridges being shipped on U.S.-bound aircraft at
airports in Britain and Dubai, the  Yemen Post  reported today,
citing a statement on a website used by Islamic militants. The
packages originated in Yemen.  Two days after the bombs were found last month, the U.S.
determined they were probably the work of al-Qaeda in the
Arabian Peninsula, as the Yemeni branch is known, according to
 John Brennan , President  Barack Obama ’s top counterterrorism
adviser. The discovery of the devices prompted the U.S., the
U.K. and Germany to impose restrictions on import of cargo from
Yemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
