Fulham manager Mark Hughes is
determined to keep goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, who’s been linked
with a move to Arsenal, the Sun said.  Fulham rejected two 2 million-pound ($3.2 million) bids for
the 38-year-old Australian prior to this season and Arsenal is
expected to revive its interest when the next transfer period
begins in January, the Sun said.  “We’ve been talking with Mark in recent weeks and,
hopefully, we’ll soon have some good news about his future,”
the Sun quoted Hughes as saying. “We are confident he is going
to be our keeper.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
