A Taiwanese business group has called
on the government to restrain the local currency’s appreciation,

Taiwan dollar will cut profit margins and hurt business, the
agency quoted Lin Ping-pin, chairman of the National Association
of Small and Medium Enterprises, as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
