China’s economic growth may slow to
about 7 percent in the next three years to five years from about
10 percent currently, according to Liu Shijin, deputy director
of the State Council’s Development Research Center.  The “inevitable” weakening of the U.S. dollar will lead
to major changes in the global currency regime and may result in
a “currency war,” Liu said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
