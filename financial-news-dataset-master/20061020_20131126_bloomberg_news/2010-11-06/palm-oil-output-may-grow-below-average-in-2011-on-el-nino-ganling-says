World palm oil output may grow at a
below-normal rate next year because the warmer, drier El Nino
weather pattern affecting Malaysia and Indonesia will likely
reduce yields, a Malaysia-based industry adviser said.  Production will rise at a rate of 4 percent instead of 6
percent to 8 percent, or an increase of 1.6 million metric tons,
 Ah Hong Ling , director of plantation investment company Ganling
Sdn Bhn, said in slides prepared to be delivered at a conference
in Guangzhou today.  Indonesia and Malaysia have been affected by El Nino in the
first half of this year, resulting in lower output, and that
trend should continue in the first six months of 2011, Ling said.  Total output in 2011 will be 41.5 million tons, Ling said,
down from his previous estimate of 44.3 million tons. Output in
2010 is projected to reach 39.9 million tons, down from the
previous estimate of 41.9 million tons, Ling said. That
represents an increase of 2.8 percent, or 1.1 million tons, from
2009, he said.  -- William Bi . Editors:  Allen Wan , Hwee Ann Tan   To contact the reporter on this story:
