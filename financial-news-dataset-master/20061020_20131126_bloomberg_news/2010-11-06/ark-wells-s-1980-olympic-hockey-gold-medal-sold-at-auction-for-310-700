The gold medal won by Mark Wells of
the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team sold at auction yesterday
for $310,700.  The medal was originally estimated to sell for $100,000,
Heritage Auctions of Dallas, who identified the winner only as a
rancher from the western U.S., said in a statement.  Wells originally sold it this year to an anonymous
collector who consigned it to the auction, according to the
statement. It was the first time any of the 1980 hockey gold
medals were offered in a public auction, Heritage Auctions said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
