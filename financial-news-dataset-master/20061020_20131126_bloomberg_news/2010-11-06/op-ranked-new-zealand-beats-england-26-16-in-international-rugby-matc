Dan Carter  kicked 16 points to lead
New Zealand to a 26-16 victory over England in their opening
autumn rugby international match.  Hosea Gear and Kieran Read touched down as the visitors
outscored England two tries to one at Twickenham Stadium in
south-west London. The top-ranked All Blacks rebounded from a
26-24 loss to Australia last week which ended their 15-Test
winning streak.  “It was really important,” New Zealand captain  Richie McCaw  said of the victory in an interview with Sky Sports. “We
knew we were going to be in for a big challenge.”  Dylan Hartley scored a try for England, with  Toby Flood 
kicking 11 points.  “We’re a very disappointed group,” England’s Nick Easter
told Sky. “For 15 minutes in the first half we switched off and
you can’t do that in top-class rugby.”  New Zealand scored both of its tries, with Carter
converting, in the opening 21 minutes to take a 14-0 lead. Flood
kicked a penalty in the 25th minute, which Carter matched to
give the All Blacks a 17-3 halftime lead.  Flood and Carter exchanged penalties after the break before
Hartley’s try in the 54th minute. Flood added the conversion to
make it 20-13, but Carter booted two more penalties to push the
New Zealand lead to 10 points.  England’s Shontayne Hape had a try claim turned down in the
76th minute when video review showed he dropped the ball before
touching down after being tackled by Isala Toeava.  Both teams next play Nov. 13 with England hosting Australia
and New Zealand meeting Scotland in Edinburgh. Australia
defeated Wales 25-16 in a match played in Cardiff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
