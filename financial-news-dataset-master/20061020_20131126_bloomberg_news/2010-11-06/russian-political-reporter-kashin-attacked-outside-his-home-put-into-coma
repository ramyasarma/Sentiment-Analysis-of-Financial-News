Oleg Kashin, a Russian political
reporter for Kommersant, was assaulted outside his central
Moscow house by unknown individuals in an attack the newspaper’s
editor in chief said was connected to his work.  Kashin, 30, received fractures to his jaw, while his skull
and fingers were broken, forcing doctors to put him in an
artificial coma, Moscow-based Kommersant said today in a
 statement . Kashin’s writing covers Russian politics, including
opposition protests and activities of youth political movements.  The attack was linked to Kashin’s professional work,
Kommersant’s editor-in-chief Mikhail Mikhailin  told  Ekho Moskvy
radio today.  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev  ordered  Prosecutor
General Yuri Chaika and Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev to
take the case under their “special control,” according to a
statement posted on the Kremlin’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
