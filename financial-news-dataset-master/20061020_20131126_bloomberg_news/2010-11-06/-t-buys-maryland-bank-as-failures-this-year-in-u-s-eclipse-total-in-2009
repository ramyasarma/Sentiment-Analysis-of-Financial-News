Regulators shut down four banks in
California, Washington and Maryland as the number of U.S.
failures this year reached 143 and eclipsed 2009’s total.  M&T Bank Corp. purchased a failed bank in Maryland as it
expands in the Mid-Atlantic region while two lenders in
California and one in Washington also collapsed, according to
statements on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  website . The
lenders had combined assets of $906 million, and the seizures
cost the agency’s deposit-insurance fund $254.5 million.  “Deposits will continue to be insured by the FDIC, so
there is no need for customers to change their banking
relationship,” the FDIC said.  Regulators closed 140 banks last year. The FDIC’s list of
“problem” banks climbed to 829 lenders with $403 billion in
assets at the end of the second quarter, a 7 percent increase
from the 775 on the list in the first quarter.  Buffalo, New York-based  M&T Bank  purchased K Bank of
Randallstown, Maryland. M&T acquired about $411 million in
assets and about $500 million of deposits, according to the
FDIC. Earlier this week, M&T agreed to purchase Wilmington Trust
Corp., the Delaware bank founded by the du Pont family, for
about $351 million in stock.  The two California banks had almost $150 million in
combined deposits. First California Bank of Westlake Village
paid a premium of 0.5 percent to pick up about $100 million in
deposits at Woodland Hills-based Western Commercial Bank. Los
Angeles’ Grandpoint Bank added $47 million in deposits from
First Vietnamese American Bank of Westminster, the FDIC said.  In Washington, Olympia’s Heritage Bank paid a 1 percent
premium for the $193.5 million in deposits of Tacoma-based
Pierce Commercial Bank, the FDIC said. Pierce Commercial is the
11th bank in the state to be closed this year, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
