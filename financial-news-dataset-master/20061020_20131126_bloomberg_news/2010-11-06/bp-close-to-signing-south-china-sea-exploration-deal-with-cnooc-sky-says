BP Plc is close to signing a
“major” exploration agreement with state-owned China National
Offshore Oil Corp., Sky News’s Mark Kleinman reported, citing
unidentified people.  BP and CNOOC would jointly explore in the South China Sea,
Kleinman wrote on his blog today. The two companies have
previously worked together in that body of water, he said. BP
aims to complete the negotiations before U.K. Prime Minister
David Cameron visits China in the coming week, Kleinman said.  Robert Wine, a spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment on the report to Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
