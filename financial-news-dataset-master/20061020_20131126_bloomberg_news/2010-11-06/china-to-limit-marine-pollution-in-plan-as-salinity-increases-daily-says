China plans to limit marine pollution
under its 12th Five-Year Plan as coastal areas suffer from a
deluge of polluted water from factories, China Daily reported,
citing Wang Bin, an official at the State Oceanic
Administration.   About 5 billion metric tons of polluted water flows into
the Bohai Sea annually, Wang, who is the deputy director of the
department of marine environment protection at the oceanic
administration said, according to the paper. Six of the
country’s 10 largest rivers are heavily polluted, he said.   Excessive use of water has also led to an increase in
offshore salinity and affected the hatching behavior of shrimp,
Wang said. The government plans to list the limitation of
missions of nitrogen and phosphorous, he said, according to the
paper.
