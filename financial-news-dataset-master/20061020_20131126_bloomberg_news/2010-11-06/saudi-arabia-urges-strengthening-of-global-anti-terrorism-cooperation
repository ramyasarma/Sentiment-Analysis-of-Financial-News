Saudi Arabia urged the international
community to strengthen its cooperation in combating terrorism
after a plot to ship bombs to the U.S. was prevented.  The latest success in halting “many terrorist attacks”
confirmed “effective cooperation” in the fight against
terrorism, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the kingdom’s foreign
minister, said today in a press conference. This will “prompt
us to strengthen it, especially in exchange of information among
countries.”  The Obama administration said Oct. 29 that Saudi Arabia
helped uncover a plot last month to ship packages of explosives
to the U.S from Yemen. U.S., European and Yemeni investigators
are working to uncover more details of a terrorist plot that
revolved around two bombs concealed in printer cartridges found
in packages that originated in Yemen.  The world’s largest oil supplier cracked down on al-Qaeda
in 2004 after militants struck an oil installation and stormed a
housing complex in the city of al-Khobar, killing 22 foreign
workers. Saudi al-Qaeda fighters fled across the 1,500-kilometer
(930-mile) border to Yemen to escape the crackdown on militants.  To contact the reporters on this story:
