Argentina doesn’t need to sell bonds
and will wait until at least 2012 to do so, Economy Minister
 Amado Boudou  said in an interview with newspaper Pagina 12.  “We will not sell debt next year,” the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper quoted Boudou as saying. “We are being offered 7
percent interest rates or less. And we say no because Argentina
does not need to sell and we are working to keep lowering
rates.”  Argentina’s government in June restructured $12.2 billion
worth of debt remaining from the country’s record $95 billion
default in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
