A strike by British Broadcasting
Corp. journalists over pensions has entered its second day,
forcing the state-funded broadcaster to again curtail programs
and run pre-recorded shows.  The National Union of Journalists’ 4,100 members at the
BBC, the world’s oldest public-service broadcaster, are striking
for 48 hours in protest over management plans to cut its
estimated 1.5 billion-pound ($2.4 billion) pension-fund deficit
by capping increases in pensionable pay.  A further 48-hour strike is planned for Nov. 15 and Nov.
16, the BBC  said  on its website today. It said that despite the
walkout, the Today program on Radio 4 and the Breakfast
television show on BBC One were broadcast as scheduled today.  The change to the pensions system “fails BBC staff,” NUJ
General Secretary  Jeremy Dear  said in a  statement  on the union’s
website on Nov. 2. “BBC journalists are not asking for higher
pensions.” They are asking for “a deal that means what has
been promised to them -- which they have already paid for -- is
protected,” he said.  The BBC, which employs about 23,000 staff, is funded by an
annual television license fee, paid by anyone using a television
set in the U.K. The broadcaster is under increased financial
pressure after the government’s spending review on Oct. 20, in
which it was announced the license fee would be frozen for six
years and the corporation would take over funding the World
Service channels from the Foreign Office.  A total of 70 percent of NUJ members voted against the
BBC’s latest pensions proposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
