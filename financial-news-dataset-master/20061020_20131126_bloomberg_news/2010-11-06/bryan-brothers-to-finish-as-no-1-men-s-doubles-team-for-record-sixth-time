Bob and Mike Bryan of the U.S. will
finish as the top-ranked doubles team in men’s tennis for a
record sixth time after winning today in Switzerland.  The 32-year-old twins beat John Isner and Sam Querrey in
three sets in the semifinals of the Swiss Indoors Basel. The
victory guarantees they cannot be overtaken in the season-ending
ATP World Tour rankings by the No. 2 team of Daniel Nestor and
Nenad Zimonjic, the tour said in a statement.  The Bryans won the Australian and U.S. opens this season,
giving them nine Grand Slam titles, and four ATP World Tour
Masters tournaments. They’ve won 10 finals overall, one short of
their career-best set in 2007.  The brothers shared the record of five year-end No. 1
finishes with Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde. The Bryans
also were top-ranked in 2003, 2005 to 2007, and 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
