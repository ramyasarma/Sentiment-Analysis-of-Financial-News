Goldikova won the $2 million
Breeders’ Cup Mile on the turf to become the first horse to win
three consecutive titles.  The 5-year-old Irish-born mare, going off as the 6-5
favorite, laid off the lead by three lengths until jockey
Olivier Peslier kicked her into gear coming down the stretch.
She ran the mile in 1 minute, 35.16 seconds, beating 10 male
contenders.  Goldikova, who has 11 top-level victories in Europe --seven
against colts -- may hold the record for consecutive victories
in Breeders’ Cup races alone for only two hours. Zenyatta, the
undefeated 6-year-old mare running in the $5 million Classic,
can tie the record.  “Right now, she is the best filly in the world. First my
filly, and now it’s up to Zenyatta,” Peslier said. “On the
last turn, she was flying and she kept running. I don’t know the
words to describe what it feels like to ride a champion like
that.”  Trainer Freddie Head has won the Breeders’ Cup Mile five
times -- twice as a jockey on Miesque in 1987 and 1988, and
three times with Goldikova since 2008.  “After winning with Miesque, she was the first filly to
win back-to-back Breeders’ Cup Miles, and this time we win it
for the third time, it’s something unreal,” Head said. “I
mean, even in the worst soap opera, you can’t imagine anything
like that. I must be a very, very lucky person, very lucky
person.”  Goldikova paid $4.60 to win on a $2 bet, $3.20 to place and
$2.40 to show. Gio Ponti was second to return $4 and $3.20,
while The Usual Q.T. was third to pay $6.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
