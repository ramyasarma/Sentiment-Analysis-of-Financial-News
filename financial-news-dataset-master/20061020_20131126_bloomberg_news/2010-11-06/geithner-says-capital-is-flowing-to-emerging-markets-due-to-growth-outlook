Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said capital is going to emerging markets because of
their growth outlook, a contrast with officials from developing
nations who blame the U.S. for fueling asset-bubble dangers.  “You can have too much of a good thing, but it is
fundamentally an encouraging thing,” Geithner told reporters
today after a meeting of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group in Kyoto, Japan. “What is driving the
flows of capital you’re seeing into emerging markets is
fundamentally a positive reflection of confidence in the likely
trajectory of growth rates in those countries over time.”  Officials from nations ranging from Brazil to South Korea
have blamed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary stimulus for
inciting the danger of excessive investment flows that cause
asset bubbles. Geithner said the risk of accelerating asset and
consumer prices is “one reason why it’s important to let
exchange rates to move closer” to economic fundamentals.  Major emerging market economies “are in the early stages of
a very long period of very strong growth in productivity and
living standards -- that’s a very encouraging thing for the
world,” the U.S. Treasury chief said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
