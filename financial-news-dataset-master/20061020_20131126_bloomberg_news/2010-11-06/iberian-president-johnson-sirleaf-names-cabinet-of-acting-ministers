Liberian  President  Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf  appointed a 22-member acting Cabinet after placing their
predecessors on “mass administrative leave.”  Deputy Finance Minister for Revenue Elfreda Tamba was
installed as acting finance minister, while veteran diplomat
Sylvester Grisby became acting foreign minister.  John C. Nylander will be acting minister for lands, mines
and energy. The list didn’t include a national security
minister.  The acting ministers attended their first Cabinet meeting
yesterday afternoon, Presidential Press Secretary Cyrus Badio
said today in an e-mailed statement. The president asked them to
ensure the government remained focused on delivering its
priorities during a short transition period, according to the
statement.  The president told ministers that her reason for
“demanding their mass administrative leave is that this
administration is entering a critical stretch and this would
afford her the opportunity to start with a fresh slate going
forward,” according to a Nov. 3  statement  published on the
website of the presidency in the capital, Monrovia. Several
ministers may eventually be reappointed to their posts,
according to the statement.  Johnson-Sirleaf, 72, was elected as Africa’s first female
president when Liberia held its first postwar elections in
October 2005. The West African nation is rebuilding its economy
following civil wars between 1989 and 2003 in which an estimated
250,000 people died and most of country’s infrastructure was
destroyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
