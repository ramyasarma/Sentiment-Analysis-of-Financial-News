Vodafone Group Plc  Chief Executive
Officer  Vittorio Colao  may signal plans to sell more of the
group’s minority stakes in overseas mobile operators when he
unveils results of a strategic review next week, the  Financial
Times  reported.  A sale of Vodafone’s 44 percent stake in Vivendi’s SFR unit
could fetch 7 billion pounds ($11.3 billion), the newspaper
said, citing UBS AG analysts.  Vodafone will also introduce a new charging model for
smartphones based on data consumption, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
