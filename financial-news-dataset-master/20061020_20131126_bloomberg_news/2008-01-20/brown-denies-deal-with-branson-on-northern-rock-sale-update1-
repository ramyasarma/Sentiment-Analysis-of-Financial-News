             U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown
denied he made a deal with billionaire  Richard Branson  over the
sale of  Northern Rock  Plc during their tour of  China  and  India .  
 The Virgin Group Ltd. founder is one of 30 executives
traveling with Brown on his trade mission, which arrived in
Delhi today. Both said yesterday that they discussed Northern
Rock during the trip, though ``not in any detail.''  
 ``I can reassure people entirely that any negotiations
about Northern Rock will be taking place in  London ,'' Brown told
reporters today. ``If a number of commercial companies are
expressing interest in the future of Northern Rock, it's right
the government explore all the options. We'd be failing in our
duty if we didn't look at all the offers that have been made.''  
 As well as Virgin, Luqman Arnold's Olivant Advisers Ltd.
has bid for the lender, which is receiving emergency loans from
the  Bank of England . Northern Rock's management also may bid.  
 Officials from Brown's office attended a party hosted by
Branson in Shanghai yesterday. Brown faced questions in an
interview with  Sky News  about his proximity to Branson at a time
when the billionaire is bidding for Northern Rock.  
 ``I would never involve myself in negotiations such as
these,'' Brown replied. ``They're of a commercial nature, led by
the Treasury.''  
 `Very Strange'  
 Vince Cable, the opposition Liberal Democrat lawmaker in
charge of Treasury issues, told Sky News that Brown's
discussions with Branson were ``certainly very strange.''  
 ``It seems a very odd way to conduct business,'' said
Cable. ``There are after all other bidders.'' He asked: ``Why
are they not being given the same access?''  
 Branson later told reporters in Delhi that his conversation
with Brown about Northern Rock had lasted ``30 seconds and that
was it.'' He said he was on the trip for the ``sole reason'' of
his business interests in China and India.  
 ``I've spent no one-to-one time with  Gordon Brown ,''
Branson said. ``It'll be the Treasury that will make this
decision, alongside shareholders, alongside other people.''  
 Northern Rock had the first run on a British bank in more
than a century in September, after the collapse of the U.S.
subprime mortgage market drove up market credit costs. The
Newcastle-based company has tapped the government for more than
25 billion pounds ($49 billion) in loans since then.  
 Brown has said nationalizing the bank remains an option,
though finding a private buyer is preferable. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Alistair Darling will tell Parliament tomorrow about
the results of a government-commissioned report by Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. into ways of funding a private sale.  
 The British Broadcasting Corp. reported Jan. 18 that
Goldman Sachs recommended converting 25 billion pounds of loans
to the bank into government-backed bonds to facilitate the sale.
Brown has repeatedly refused to comment on the detail of the
proposals.
