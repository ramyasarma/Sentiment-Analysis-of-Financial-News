                  Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Pacific Investment Management Co.  is
slowly shifting investments from developed nations into emerging
markets,  Folha de S.Paulo  reported, citing an interview with the
company’s Chief Executive Officer  Mohamed A. El-Erian .  
 The differences between industrialized nations and emerging
markets are becoming “irrelevant,” El-Erian said, according to
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  
 Brazil is the emerging market in which Pimco has “by far”
its largest investments, Folha said, citing El-Erian. He said
Brazil needs to increase private investments and to reform its
tax system that still hurts economic growth prospects, Folha
reported.  
 Pimco is the world’s biggest bond  fund  and is based in
Newport Beach, California.
