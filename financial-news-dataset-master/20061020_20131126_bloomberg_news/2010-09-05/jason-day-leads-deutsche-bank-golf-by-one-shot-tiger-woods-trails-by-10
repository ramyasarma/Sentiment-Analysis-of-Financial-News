             Charley Hoffman  won the Deutsche
Bank Championship to climb to second place in the U.S. PGA
Tour’s playoff rankings, while  Tiger Woods  did enough to retain
his No. 1 golf ranking and stay in the FedEx Cup.  
 Hoffman had 11 birdies in a final round 62 at the TPC
Boston in Norton, Massachusetts, yesterday to win the second
tournament in the playoffs and $1.35 million. The 33-year-old
American finished at 22-under par to win by five strokes from
 Jason Day , his fellow Australian  Geoff Ogilvy  and England’s  Luke Donald , who tied for second place.  
 “Just got it going this week,” Hoffman, who began the
tournament 59th in the FedEx Cup standings, told reporters after
his second win on the PGA Tour.  
 Woods remained the world’s top-ranked player after a final
round 68 took him to 10-under par for the tournament and a tie
for 11th place.  Phil Mickelson  could have ended Woods’s 273-week
reign as world No. 1 by finishing fourth or higher. Instead, he
finished in a tie for 25th after two double bogeys on the last
nine holes contributed to a final-round score of 5-over-par 76.  
 Woods climbed to 51 in the FedEx standings after entering
the tournament at No. 65. The top 70 after the Deutsche Bank go
on to the third playoff event, the BMW Championship. Woods must
be among the top 30 after that to make the season-ending Tour
Championship in Atlanta from Sept. 23-26.  
 “I’ve just got to keep playing well,” Woods told
reporters. “Winning takes care of everything -- the world
rankings, Player of the Year awards, all the trophies and things
that come with it. That only happens when you win. Most of my
career I’ve been able to do that and I just haven’t done it this
year.”  
 The FedEx Cup goes to the top player after the four playoff
tournaments and carries a $10 million bonus. Woods has won it
twice in the past three years.
