Derek Jeter  and his agent met with
New York Yankees executives for several hours two days ago,
their first face-to-face meeting since Nov. 8, media outlets
including  ESPN reported .  The 11-time All-Star shortstop and agent  Casey Close  met
with Yankees owner  Hal Steinbrenner , General Manager  Brian Cashman  and President  Randy Levine , the reports said.  The Yankees have offered a $45 million, three-year contract
to Jeter, whose 10-year, $189 million contract expired last
season.  Jeter, 36, the team’s captain, batted .270 with a .340 on-
base percentage in 2010, both the lowest in a season since he
became a full-time player in 1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
