Botswana’s annual spending to fight
AIDS is unsustainable, Daily News reported, citing the country’s
President  Ian Khama .  The budget for HIV/AIDS in the 2009-10 fiscal year was 1.3
billion pula ($194 million) and the government is paying for
treatment for more than 151,000 people, the Gaborone-based,
state-owned newspaper said. This was virtually all those who
registered for treatment, it said, citing Khama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
