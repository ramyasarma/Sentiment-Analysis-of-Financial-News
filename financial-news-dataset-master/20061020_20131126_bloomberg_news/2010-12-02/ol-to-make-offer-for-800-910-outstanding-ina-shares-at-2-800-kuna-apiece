Mol Nyrt ., Hungary’s largest refiner,
is offering to buy the outstanding shares in Croatian peer  Ina
Industrija Nafte d.d.  for 2.24 billion Croatian kuna ($401
million), the company said.  Mol is offering to pay 2,800 Croatian kuna per share for
the 800,910 Ina shares traded on the Zagreb bourse, Mol said in
a statement posted on the  website  of the Budapest Stock Exchange
today. The “majority” of the shares are held by Ina employees
and individuals who purchased the stock at the time of Ina’s
initial public offering, according to the statement.  Mol is Ina’s single largest shareholder with a 47.2 percent
stake and has operational control over the company. The
Budapest-based refiner is focusing on improving profitability at
Ina, as part of its drive to boost earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization by $201 million by 2012
from the 2009 level.  Mol, which jointly with the Croatian government owns a
91.99 percent stake in Ina, already made an offer to purchase
the outstanding shares in 2008, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
