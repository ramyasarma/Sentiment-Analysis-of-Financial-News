Clearwire Corp. , the high-speed
wireless network carrier 54-percent owned by Sprint Nextel
Corp., said it plans to sell at least $1.1 billion of debt after
saying last month it may not have enough funding to keep
operating.  “In terms of Sprint, we believe this is the best
resolution one could hope for,”  Jennifer Fritzsche , a Wells
Fargo & Co. analyst in Chicago, wrote in a note to clients. “It
does not have to put up capital at this time - which had been a
huge concern for investors -- but has the right to keep its
ownership stake down the road.”  The funding may also provide Kirkland, Washington-based
 Clearwire  the ability to expand service to an additional 25
million to 30 million customers in 2011, according to Fritzsche,
who rates the shares “outperform.”  Clearwire may offer $175 million of first-priority senior
secured notes due in 2015, $500 million of second-priority
secured notes due 2017 and $500 million of exchangeable notes
due 2040, the company said today in a statement distributed by
Business Wire.  Clearwire is trying to raise the debt after disclosing in a
Nov. 4 filing continued losses and funding uncertainty “raises
substantial doubt about our ability to continue.” A default
could trigger a contract provision pulling Sprint, the third-
largest U.S. mobile phone carrier, into default as well.  Default Protection  Credit-default swaps on Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint
surged last month after the Clearwire disclosure, jumping 114.5
basis points to as high as 420.6 on Nov. 30. The contracts fell
40.3 basis points today to 367 at 8:57 a.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.  Contracts protecting a net $2.01 billion of Sprint’s debt
were outstanding as of Nov. 26, according to the  Depository
Trust Clearing Corp ., which runs a central repository for the
credit swaps market.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  “You lighten the load of funding by raising the debt,”
said  Chris Larsen , an equity analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. in
New York.  4G Provider  Sprint rose 16 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $3.93 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading as of 10:01 a.m., while
Clearwire declined 36 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $6.46 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  Clearwire said last month it’s cutting 15 percent of its
workforce, reducing sales and marketing spending and delaying
its Clear-branded smartphone as part of a plan to save between
$100 million and $200 million this year.  The company was reshaped into a 4G provider in 2008 with a
$3.2 billion infusion from a group of investors, including
Sprint, Google Inc., Time Warner Cable Inc., Intel Corp., Bright
House Networks and Comcast Corp.  Clearwire got another $1.56 billion from investors, most of
which was provided by Sprint, a year ago and sold more than $2
billion in  debt . The last infusion helped Clearwire maintain
plans to cover 120 million people with its service by the end of
this year.  The first-lien notes will be issued as a reopening of the
company’s 12 percent notes initially sold in November 2009, the
statement said. Proceeds may be used for working capital and for
general corporate purposes, Clearwire said. The debt will be
offered through its Clearwire Communications LLC unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
