The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission official in charge of spotting risk to financial
markets said the agency will never be able to match the pace of
industry innovation even as it expands its understanding of
complex financial instruments.  “There’s no question that the people in industry will
always be far ahead of regulators,”  Henry Hu , the outgoing head
of the SEC’s Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial
Innovation, said today at the  Hedge Funds New York  conference
sponsored by Bloomberg Link. “We don’t want to be so far behind
that we can’t see them on the horizon.”  Hu, who joined the SEC in 2009 to lead the newly created
unit, said he focused on bringing in staff with different legal
and investment backgrounds to improve the agency’s understanding
of “how exactly derivatives work, what should be done in terms
of their regulation,” he said at the conference.  The  University of Texas  professor, who is leaving the
agency to return to academia, likened the SEC’s rulemaking
workload imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial-regulation law to
the ceaseless conveyer belt of chocolates faced by characters in
an episode of the 1950s television series “I Love Lucy.”  “Some of us at the SEC sympathize with Lucy and Ethel,”
he said. “The SEC is in Washington, not Hollywood, but I am
firmly convinced that with the help of market participants,
investors, hedge funds, financial institutions and so forth,
that working together, we’ll be in a happy ending.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
