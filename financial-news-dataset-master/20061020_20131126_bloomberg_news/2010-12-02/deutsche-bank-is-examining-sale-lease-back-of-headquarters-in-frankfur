Deutsche Bank AG , Germany’s largest
bank, may sell its Frankfurt base as investor demand for office
space increases in the country’s financial center.  The company “is deliberating over the question if real
estate should be kept in proprietary possession or should be
used via a sale-and-lease-back,” according to an e-mailed
statement today.  Deutsche Bank bought the two 36-story glass towers, known
as Soll und Haben, or Debit and Credit, from one of its real
estate funds for 272 million euros ($359 million) in 2007. The
bank spent three years renovating the buildings to make them
more environmentally friendly and has started the process of
moving 2,800 people back in over the next three months.  Demand for Frankfurt office space is rising as the German
economy rebounds from the global financial crisis, prompting the
most investment in the city since 2007. It may reach 2 billion
euros this year, according to CB Richard Ellis Group Inc., the
world’s largest property adviser.  Deutsche Bank may sell the Frankfurt building for 500
million euros, Financial Times Deutschland reported today,
citing unidentified people familiar with the situation.  Banco Santander SA, Spain’s biggest banks, and HSBC
Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank by market value, both sold
their head offices and leased them back in the past two years.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
