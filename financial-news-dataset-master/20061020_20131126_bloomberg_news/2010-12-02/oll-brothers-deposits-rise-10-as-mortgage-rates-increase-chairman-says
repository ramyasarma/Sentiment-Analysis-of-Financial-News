Toll Brothers Inc. , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, saw deposits increase 10 percent compared
with a year earlier in the past two weeks as mortgage rates
began to rise, Chairman  Robert Toll  said.  “In the last two weeks, interest rates have been going
up,” Toll said today during the company’s earnings call. “So
finally there is no longer a reason to sit and wait.”  U.S. mortgage rates climbed for the third straight week to
a three-month high, Freddie Mac reported today. The average rate
for a 30-year  fixed loan  rose to 4.46 percent in the week ending
today from 4.40 percent, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage
finance company said. The rate had fallen to 4.17 percent in the
week ended Nov. 11, the lowest in records dating to 1971.  Toll’s comments followed a surprise increase in an index of
pending home sales in October. The number of Americans signing
contracts to buy previously owned homes jumped by a record 10
percent, the National Association of Realtors said. The Standard
& Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilding  Index  gained 3.9 percent at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Toll shares increased 41 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $18.87.
The company reported its second straight quarterly profit today
as a tax benefit helped boost results amid slumping sales.  Toll Brothers’ net income for the three months through
October was $50.5 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $111.4 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier, the
Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement today.
The tax benefit totaled $59.9 million.  Toll Brothers expects to sell between 2,100 and 2,900 homes
in fiscal 2011 at an average price of $540,000 to $565,000. The
company sold 2,642 units in the recently ended year, down 11
percent from fiscal 2009.  For the year, Toll Brothers reported a net loss of $3.37
million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a loss of $756
million, or $4.68, in fiscal 2009.  “Our 2010 is not a bad indicator of how we expect 2011 to
turn out,” Chief Financial Officer  Martin Connor  said during
the conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
