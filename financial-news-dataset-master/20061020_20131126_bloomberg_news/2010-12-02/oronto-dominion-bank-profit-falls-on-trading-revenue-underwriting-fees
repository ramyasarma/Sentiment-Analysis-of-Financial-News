Toronto-Dominion Bank , Canada’s
second-largest bank, said profit fell 1.6 percent on a decline
in trading and underwriting fees.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 dropped to C$994
million ($980 million), or C$1.07 a share, from C$1.01 billion,
or C$1.12, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in
a statement.  Profit at the investment-banking unit fell 74 percent to
C$95 million on reduced equity and fixed-income trading, and
lower underwriting fees.  Before one-time items, Toronto-Dominion said it earned
C$1.38 a share. That missed the C$1.46-a-share average  estimate 
of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Toronto-Dominion rose 60 cents to C$75.29 in trading
yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have climbed
14 percent this year, compared with an 8.9 increase for the 10-
member  S&P/TSX Banks Index .  Canadian consumer banking profit climbed 24 percent to
C$773 million on higher volumes in banking, financing and real
estate lending.  “They focus very, very well on retail banking, and that’s
where the margins are,” said  Tony Demarin , chief investment
officer of BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which
manages about C$230 million, including Toronto-Dominion shares.  U.S. Earnings  U.S. consumer banking profit more than doubled to C$265
million. Chief Executive Officer  Edmund Clark  has said he
expects the bank to earn $1.6 billion a year from its U.S.
operations within three years. The bank now has more U.S.
branches than it does in Canada.  “We’ve moved ourselves into a position where we have a
sustainable position,” in the U.S., Clark said in an October
interview. “We now have a management team in place, enough
presence to say ‘okay, we’ve got a base where we can grow
here’.”  For the full year, Toronto-Dominion earned C$4.64 billion,
up from C$3.12 billion a year ago.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. local
