Kroger Co. , the largest U.S. grocery-
store chain, tumbled the most in a year after lowering the top
end of its full-year profit forecast.  Kroger projected per-share earnings of $1.65 to $1.78,
compared with its previous forecast of $1.60 to $1.80, according
to a statement today by the Cincinnati-based retailer. The
average of analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey was $1.78.  The slow economic recovery is hurting grocery sales and
consumers are “cautious in their spending,” Chief Executive
Officer  David Dillon  told analysts on a conference call. The
recovery is slower and weaker than Kroger had expected and
competition remains “intense,” he said.  Kroger sank $2.23, or 9.4 percent, to $21.63 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline
since Dec. 8, 2009. The shares have gained 5.4 percent this
year.  -- Editor: Robin Ajello, Cecile Daurat  To contact the reporter on this story:
