China expects a meeting of officials
from the U.S., Japan and South Korea scheduled for Dec. 6 to
ease tensions and promote dialogue on the Korean peninsula, said
 Jiang Yu , a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.  China will keep “close watch” on the meeting and expects
the three nations to take regional peace and stability into
account, Jiang said in a  statement  posted on the ministry’s
website today. China hopes the countries will give “positive
consideration” of its proposal to solve the issue, Jiang said.  The meeting of U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton ,
South Korean Foreign Minister  Kim Sung Hwan  and Japanese Foreign
Minister  Seiji Maehara  demonstrates the nations’ “commitment to
security on the Korean peninsula and stability in the region,”
the State Department said in a statement yesterday.  China proposed “emergency” six-nation talks be held early
this month in Beijing to address increasing military tensions
after North Korea’s Nov. 23 artillery attack on a South Korean
island, Wu Dawei, China’s top envoy for the negotiations, said
on Nov. 28. The U.S., South Korea and Japan have said they want
to see concrete action by North Korea before talks resume.  North Korea pulled out of the discussions with China, South
Korea, the U.S., Japan and Russia and expelled international
arms inspectors after the United Nations said an April 2009
rocket launch violated a Security Council resolution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
