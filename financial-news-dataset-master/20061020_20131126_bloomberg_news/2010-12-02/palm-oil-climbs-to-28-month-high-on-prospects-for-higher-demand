Palm oil advanced for a fourth day to
the highest price in more than two years on speculation that the
global demand for vegetable oils will surpass demand.  The February-delivery contract rose as much as 1.6 percent
to 3,540 ringgit ($1,123) a metric ton before closing at 3,500
ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the highest price
since July 15, 2008. Prices, up 31.4 percent this year, are set
for a second annual gain.  Global palm oil demand is growing 7 percent to 11 percent a
year,  Bayu Krisnamurthi , deputy farm minister in Indonesia, the
biggest producer, said today. World stockpiles of vegetable oils
will equal 13.2 percent of demand in the 2010-2011 season, a
“critically low level,” the Food and Agriculture Organization,
or FAO, said in a  report  last month.  “Exports from Malaysia point to strong demand for palm oil
among major importers such as China, the European Union and
India,” said  Krishna Reddy , an analyst at Way2Wealth
Commodities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Increased demand is coming in at a
time when concerns about supplies are mounting.”  Malaysia’s exports 19.2 percent to 1.56 million tons in
November from the previous month, independent surveyor Societe
Generale de Surveillance said this week. Shipments to China and
India, the biggest cooking-oil users, jumped 66.3 percent and
72.8 percent respectively, SGS data showed.  Global output of vegetable oils including palm oil, soybean
oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil will increase 1.5 percent to
174.6 million tons, the FAO forecast. Still, it will lag behind
demand, estimated by the United Nations’ agency at 178 million
tons, draining inventories.  Lower Output  Palm oil output in Indonesia may be 21.8 million tons this
year, less than the 22.5 million tons forecast previously, on
lower yields, the China National Grain & Oils Information Center
said on Nov. 29, citing OilWorld, an industry publication.  Output in Malaysia, the second-biggest producer,  dropped  1
percent to 14.3 million tons in the first 10 months of the year,
according to data from the nation’s palm oil board. Production
this year may total 17.6 million tons, Plantation Industries and
Commodities Minister  Bernard Dompok  said Nov. 17.  “As concerns about soybean supplies have not eased yet,
palm oil will continue its rally,” Reddy said. Palm oil may
climb to 3,800 ringgit in the next one month, he said.  January-delivery soybean oil lost as much as 0.7 percent to
52.27 cents a pound in after-hours trading on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices climbed 3.2 percent yesterday, the most in two
weeks. Soybeans for January delivery shed as much as 0.7 percent
to $12.7375 a bushel after advancing 3.2 percent yesterday, the
most since Nov. 9.  China’s National Development and Reform Commission asked
some producers including COFCO Ltd., Yihai Kerry Investment Co.
and 93 Group not to raise cooking oil prices in the next four
months, the China Business News reported, citing an unidentified
person who attended a conference of the top economic planner.  September-delivery palm oil on the Dalian exchange climbed
0.9 percent to 9,066 yuan ($1,361) a ton, the highest closing
price since Nov. 12, and soybean oil for delivery in the same
month advanced 0.9 percent to 9,718 yuan a ton, a two-week high.  CME Group Inc.’s March palm oil contract fell as much
as 1.6 percent to $1,096.25 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
