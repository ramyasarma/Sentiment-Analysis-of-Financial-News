Asian  stocks  rose, with a regional
benchmark index climbing the most in almost a month, after U.S.
economic reports and speculation that Europe’s debt crisis will
be contained boosted confidence in a global recovery.  Canon Inc., a Japanese camera maker that derives about 80
percent of its revenue abroad, rose 2.5 percent in Tokyo after
reports showed U.S. payrolls and manufacturing climbed. James
Hardie Industries SE, the biggest seller of home siding in the
U.S., jumped 6.2 percent in Sydney. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, climbed 2.6 percent as oil and
metal prices increased.  Cnooc Ltd. , China’s biggest offshore oil
producer, increased 3.2 percent in Hong Kong.  “The outlook for equities next year is optimistic as the
macroeconomic picture is improving not just for the U.S. but
also for China,” said  Michiya Tomita , Hong Kong-based fund
manager for Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which holds
about $65 billion in assets. “The recent selling on concerns
about monetary tightening in China and escalating tensions in
the Korean peninsula seems excessive.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  advanced 1.5 percent, the most
since Nov. 4, to 131.73 as of 7:26 p.m. in Tokyo, with about
four stocks rising for each that fell. The gauge is on course
for its first weekly gain after declining for three straight
weeks on concern China will boost anti-inflation measures and
amid rising tensions between North and South Korea.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 2 percent, even after a
government report showed that retail sales unexpectedly declined
in October. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 1.8 percent,
as the Finance Ministry said today in Tokyo today that Japanese
companies increased spending for the first time in more than
three years.  U.S. Data  Chinese power companies helped drive Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index and China’s Shanghai Composite Index higher, while in
Taipei, financial services and technology companies paced gains
on Taiwan’s Taiex Index.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.4
percent today. The index surged yesterday in New York by 2.2
percent, the most since Sept. 1. A report from ADP Employer
Services showed businesses added 93,000 workers to payrolls in
November, more than the 70,000 expected by economists, based on
the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Also in the U.S., the Institute for Supply Management said
its factory index, a gauge of manufacturing, was little changed
at 56.6 last month after a five-month high of 56.9 in October. A
reading higher than 50 signals growth.  Debt Crisis  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 2 percent yesterday, the
most since Sept. 1, amid speculation European Central Bank
policy makers may step up measures to contain the region’s
government-debt crisis, and after a report yesterday showed
China’s manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in seven
months in November.  “China’s market has become more closely linked to the
world economy,” said Shen Nan, a strategist at Changjiang
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The improving U.S. data will help
boost investors confidence and overall market performance.”  Canon added 2.5 percent to 4,050 yen in Tokyo.  Sony Corp. ,
the Japanese maker of Bravia televisions that gets 70 percent of
its sales abroad, rose 0.8 percent to 3,040.  Honda Motor Co. , a
Japanese automaker that gets more than 40 percent of sales from
North America, gained 1.8 percent to 3,135 yen.  The dollar appreciated to 84.40 yen last night in Tokyo,
near the highest level since Sept. 27. A stronger dollar boosts
the value of U.S. income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  ‘Market Sentiment’  James Hardie jumped 6.2 percent to A$5.84 in Sydney, and
 Brambles Ltd. , the world’s biggest supplier of wooden pallets
that gets about 45 percent of its sales from the America’s,
advanced 2.6 percent to A$7.02.  Leighton Holdings Ltd. ,
Australia’s largest construction company, surged 3.4 percent to
A$32.31 after its Theiss unit won a A$5.5 billion ($5.3 billion)
contract to build and operate a coal mine for India’s NTPC Ltd.  “We are seeing promising signs in the economy and market
sentiment is improving globally,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Improving sentiment should boost
money flow into risk assets.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 7.8 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with gains of 8.2 percent by
the S&P 500 and 5.2 percent by the  Stoxx 600 . Shares in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.3 times estimated  earnings  on
average at yesterday’s close, compared with 14.2 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Material Stocks  A measure of material stocks tracked on the Asia Pacific
gauge gained 1.9 percent after the London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum climbed 2.6 percent yesterday, the most since Nov. 4.  BHP, also Australia’s largest oil company, advanced 2.6
percent to A$44.33 in Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
third-biggest mining company, climbed 2.3 percent to A$85.01.
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. , Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas producer,
gained 1.8 percent to A$42.05 after crude oil for January
delivery jumped 3.1 percent to $86.75 a barrel in New York
yesterday, the highest settlement price since Nov. 11. Cnooc
gained 3.2 percent to HK$17.54 in Hong Kong.  Huaneng Power International Inc. , China’s largest
electricity producer, rallied 6.8 percent to HK$4.42 in Hong
Kong after China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency said the
government ordered a freeze in 2011 contract prices for coal
used in power stations.  Datang International Power Generation
Co. , the second biggest producer, gained 6.8 percent to HK$2.99.  Power Producers  Power-station coal prices under term contracts must be
unchanged from 2010 levels, Xinhua reported yesterday, citing
 Cao Changqing , head of pricing at the National Development and
Reform Commission. “Any form of price increase is not
allowed,” Cao was quoted as saying.  In Taipei,  Wintek Corp.  advanced 1.5 percent to NT$55 after
the touch-panel maker said November revenue rose to NT$8.85
billion ($291 million) from NT$8.25 billion in October. Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract
manufacturer of chips, increased 2.5 percent to NT$66.20 after
chairman  Morris Chang  said he expects first-quarter sales to be
stronger than the seasonal average.  First Financial Holding Co.  led gains among the island’s
financial services companies, jumping 4.6 percent to NT$22.80
after Credit Suisse Group AG analysts wrote in a report today
that they expect consumer banks to boost earnings next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
