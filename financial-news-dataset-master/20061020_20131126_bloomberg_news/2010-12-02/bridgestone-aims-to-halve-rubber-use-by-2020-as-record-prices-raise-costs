Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s
largest tiremaker, expects to cut rubber consumption by 50
percent in the next decade after prices more than quadrupled to
a record from their 2008 low.  Technology being developed will halve use of natural and
synthetic  rubber  in each Bridgestone tire without affecting
product quality, Masayuki Ishii, general manager at the
corporate communications division, said in an interview.  Bridgestone, Michelin & Cie. and  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. 
are seeking to control costs after the price of rubber used in
tires soared because of floods in Thailand, the top producer,
and growing demand in China, the biggest user. Tokyo-based
Bridgestone raised U.S. prices last month for the third time
this year. The group may struggle to pass on costs in  deflation -
hit Japan, said Satoru Takada from research company TIW Inc.  “The company is moving in the right direction by reducing
risks from raw materials as world auto demand keeps expanding,
buoying prices,” said analyst Takada in Tokyo. “Other
tiremakers will probably follow suit,” he said.  Michelin’s full-year expenses will rise by 600 million
euros to 650 million euros because of higher raw-material costs,
the company said in October. Goodyear, the largest U.S.
tiremaker, expects raw-material costs to jump 35 percent for the
fourth quarter.  Rich Kramer , the chief executive officer, said
he is “aggressively pursuing” synthetic rubber options.  Usage Cut  Bridgestone’s new technology will reduce the amount of all
tire materials, including natural and synthetic rubber,
incrementally over 10 years without cutting performance, Ishii
said, declining to elaborate.  The company will use 1.77 million metric tons of natural
and synthetic rubber for tire production this year, up 24
percent from 2009. Of the total, 1.23 million tons, or 69
percent, is for output overseas, he said.  “It’s quite reasonable to cut the use of raw materials as
they become expensive,” Ishii said in Tokyo on Nov. 30. “Our
company has the technological ability to realize that.” Company
President  Shoshi Arakawa  wants to achieve the 50 percent cut in
less than 10 years, he said.  Natural rubber represented 28.9 percent of tire weight in
Japan last year, while its synthetic rival accounted for 21.4
percent, according to  the Japan Automobile Tyre Manufacturers
Association . Bridgestone’s use of natural rubber is larger than
the industry average as it produces more heavy-vehicle tires,
said public relations manager  Kaoru Tomizawa .  Wider Deficit  Global consumption of natural rubber will outstrip supply
by 313,000 tons this year, the most since 2006, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. predicted in a November report, revising its
September outlook for an 82,000-ton deficit.  Goldman Sachs raised its price forecast to $4.40 per
kilogram next year from $3.60, and to $4.60 per kilogram in 2012
from $3.80, the report said. Rubber for July delivery gained 0.9
percent to $4.405 a kilogram in Singapore today. The most-active
contract climbed to a record $4.489 on Nov. 11, more than four
times the low of $1 in December 2008.  “Supply is unlikely to grow substantially at this stage
due to falling yields as trees age as well as the fact that many
farmers are shifting from rubber into palm oil,”  Yuichiro Isayama  and three other Goldman Sachs analysts said. “We’re not
expecting supply to increase by a significant degree until 2013-
2014, when trees planted in 2006-2007 start to contribute.”  China’s Demand  Global tire shipments will keep increasing as economic
expansion and income growth, especially in Asia, boosts vehicle
sales, Bridgestone Director Yujiro Kanahara said in the same
interview. World demand for passenger car tires may grow 20
percent by 2015 from last year, while demand for truck and bus
tires will expand by 50 percent, he said.  Growth in China will be faster than other markets in the
next five years with the company expecting an 80 percent
expansion in tire demand, Kanahara said. India will grow at the
second-fastest pace of 50 percent for passenger car tires.  China’s passenger-car sales  rose at the fastest pace in six
months in October as government incentives for fuel-efficient
cars boosted buying in the world’s largest market. Wholesale
deliveries of cars, sport-utility vehicles and multipurpose
vehicles increased 27 percent from a year earlier to 1.2 million,
according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange gained
2.2 percent to 371.3 yen per kilogram ($4,416 a ton) at 1:50 p.m.
local time. The price for the most-active contract reached a 30-
year high of 383 yen on Nov. 11.  Bridgestone operates 47 tire plants worldwide. The company
held a 16.2 percent share in the global tire market in 2009,
followed by  Michelin  with 15.5 percent, according to  Tire
Business  newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
