Lithuanian Prime Minister  Andrius Kubilius  said an opposition plan to raise retirement benefits
risks undermining the country’s currency.  Lawmakers backed a proposal to increase pensions to pre-
crisis levels in a first reading last week, a move that would
raise spending by about 500 million litai ($188 million). The
proposal requires a final vote in Parliament, where Kubilius’
ruling coalition holds a one-vote majority. In the first vote,
the proposal was supported by 64 to 33, with 30 abstentions.  “That’s an irresponsible proposal,” Kubilius said in a
radio interview with  Ziniu Radijas  today. “Do we want to break
the financial system? The stability of the litas is a very
fragile issue.”  The government introduced two-year cuts to social benefits
and pensions at the end of last year, helping reduce spending by
about 5 percent of gross domestic product. Pensions were cut by
an average of 5 percent from January, while the lowest
retirement incomes remained unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
