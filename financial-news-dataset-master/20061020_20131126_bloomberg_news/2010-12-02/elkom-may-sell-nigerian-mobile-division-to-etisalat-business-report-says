Telkom South Africa Ltd. is in talks
to sell the mobile-phone division of its Nigerian unit, Multi-
Links, to Emirates Telecommunications Corp., Business Report
said, citing a letter from an unidentified Multi-Links
executive.  One of the options being considered was to sell 80 percent
of Multi-Links to Etisalat, as the company is known, a proposal
that was rejected by Telkom’s board, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. Telkom spokesman Pynee Chetty declined to
comment on the speculation, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
