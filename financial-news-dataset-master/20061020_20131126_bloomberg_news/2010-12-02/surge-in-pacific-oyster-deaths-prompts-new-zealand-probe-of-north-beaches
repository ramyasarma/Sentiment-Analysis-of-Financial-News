New Zealand is investigating a surge
in deaths of Pacific oysters in marine farms on the nation’s
North Island.  Some farmers have seen the mortality rate of young oysters
more than triple since mid-November,  Biosecurity New Zealand 
said in a  statement  today. About 250 samples from farms around
the nation’s northern coast will be analyzed to determine the
cause of the deaths, it said.  Death rates for cultivated Pacific oysters are typically
no more than 10 percent,  Aquaculture New Zealand  Chief 
Executive Officer Mike Burrell said in the statement. This
year the rate at some farms has varied between 30 percent and
80 percent, “which is very concerning for the industry,” he said.  New Zealand’s oyster industry was worth NZ$26 million ($20
million) in 2009, Adam Hicks, a spokesman for Nelson-based
Aquaculture New Zealand, said in a telephone interview.  No problems with other oyster varieties, including Bluff
oysters, have been detected and New Zealand’s  Food Safety
Authority  has no concerns with the nation’s oysters, Biosecurity
New Zealand said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
