Treasuries snapped a two-day rally
before government reports this week that economists said will
show U.S. gross domestic product grew faster than previously
estimated and consumer spending climbed.  Government bonds fell this month as the gap between yields
on longer-maturity Treasuries showed that the Federal Reserve’s
second round of quantitative easing may be its last. The Fed is
scheduled to buy $7 billion to $9 billion of debt due from 2018
to 2020 and $6 billion to $8 billion of securities maturing from
2014 to 2016 today as part of the plan to spur growth.  “The economy continues to recover,” said  Hiroki Shimazu ,
a Tokyo-based economist at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., part
of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-largest
publicly traded bank by assets. “Fear of deflation will
gradually disappear. It will push up yields.”  Benchmark 10-year notes yielded 3.33 percent as of 9:49 a.m.
in Tokyo, according to BGCantor Market Data. The 2.625 percent
security maturing in November 2020 traded at a price of 94 3/32.  Treasuries rallied Dec. 16 and Dec. 17, pushing 10-year
rates down by 20 basis points, as yields near a seven-month high
attracted investors. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.8 percent annual pace in
the third quarter, quicker than the 2.5 percent estimate
published last month, the Commerce Department will say Dec. 22,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Spending by consumers rose
0.5 percent in November after a 0.4 percent increase in October,
a separate Bloomberg survey showed before the Dec. 23 report.  Spread Narrows  The  difference  between 10- and 30-year yields shrank to
1.05 percentage points on Dec. 15 from a record 1.60 points on
Nov. 10, the fastest contraction since the 1980s, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The shift in the so-called yield
curve is taking place as Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show U.S. bonds due in 10 years or more lost 4.64 percent
this month, trimming 2010’s gain to 8.37 percent.  Flattening usually foreshadows the end of Fed interest-rate
cuts aimed at stimulating growth. U.S. reports this month showed
rising  retail sales , higher consumer confidence and a jump in
industrial production after the central bank expanded its
 balance sheet  to an unprecedented $2.39 trillion, pumping money
into the financial system. It’s adding $600 billion more,
purchasing Treasuries through so-called quantitative easing to
keep the economy from deflating.  “A peak in the yield spread between 10s and 30s signals
the end of an easing cycle,” said  Steven Wieting , managing
director of economic and market analysis at Citigroup Inc.
“It’s part of a recovery and improved growth expectations. If
the outlook is for a stronger recovery, then QE would be limited
and they may not expand beyond it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
