Iran and Syria, under international
investigation for possible weapons-related nuclear work, top the
agenda of today’s meeting at the International Atomic Energy
Agency.  The IAEA’s 35-member board of governors convenes at around
10 a.m. local time in Vienna. The group, chaired by Pakistan,
may also decide to fund a nuclear fuel bank operated by the
agency, according to a copy of the meeting agenda.  Iran’s nuclear program, which has drawn four sets of United
Nations sanctions, is at the center of European Union-led talks
scheduled for Dec. 6 and 7 in Geneva. Iran has the world’s
second-largest oil and natural gas reserves and says it’s
producing uranium to fuel nuclear reactors. The U.S. and Europe
accuse Iran of trying to build nuclear weapons.  IAEA inspectors are also trying to gain greater access to
sites in Syria that the U.S. alleges were part of a military
program. Syria has denied inspectors access to sites, including
a uranium-extraction plant built with IAEA technical assistance,
according to a restricted report obtained by Bloomberg and
scheduled to be released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
