The Australian and New Zealand
dollars had their biggest weekly gains in a month against their
U.S. counterpart as commodities climbed, supporting demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The two South Pacific currencies rallied as the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies  CRB Index  of 19 raw materials advanced for a
third straight day, rising 1.1 percent. The measure gained 4.9
percent for the week, the most since October 2009.  “Commodities are surging,”  said  Brian Dolan , chief
strategist at FOREX.com, a unit of the online currency trading
firm Gain Capital in Bedminster, New Jersey. “The markets are
still quite optimistic on the outlook for the global recovery.”  Australia’s dollar rose 1.3 percent today and advanced 2.5
percent this week to 98.97 U.S. cents at 2:01 p.m. in New York.
It was the biggest weekly gain since Nov. 5. The currency gained
0.1 percent today and 1.1 percent for the week to 81.99 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, strengthened 1.2
percent today and climbed 1.8 percent on the week, also the most
since Nov. 5, to 76.40 U.S. cents. It gained 0.4 percent for the
week to 63.30 yen.  The Australian currency briefly pared its weekly gain today
after a report showed the nation’s services industry contracted
in November. The performance-of services index fell 4.5 points
to 46.2, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the Australian
Industry Group said today. A figure below 50 indicates
contraction.  U.S. Service Industries  The Aussie and kiwi gained today as data showed U.S.
service industries expanded in November at the fastest pace in
six months. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-
manufacturing index, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 55, from 54.3 in October.  The currencies rose even as data showed U.S. employers
added 39,000 jobs last month, less than one-third the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The Labor
Department revised October’s gain up to 172,000 jobs, the
biggest gain since May.  The U.S. was the third-biggest overseas market for New
Zealand after Australia and China during the 12 months ended
October, according to  data  gathered by Statistics New Zealand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
