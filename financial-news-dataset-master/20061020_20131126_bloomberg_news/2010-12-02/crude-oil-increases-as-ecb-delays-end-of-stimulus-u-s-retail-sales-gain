Crude rose to a two-year high after
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the
bank will delay its withdrawal of stimulus measures and pending
sales of existing U.S. homes jumped by a record amount.  Oil climbed 1.4 percent and the dollar dropped against the
euro after Trichet said the ECB will keep offering banks as much
cash as they want through the first quarter. The number of
Americans signing contacts to buy previously owned homes
increased 10  percent  in October, the National Association of
Realtors said today in Washington.  “The dollar’s drop is giving the market support,” said
 Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover Inc., a trading-
advisory company in New Canaan, Connecticut. “There’s an
inverse correlation between the dollar and oil, and we’re seeing
it at work today.”  Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.25 to $88 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement
since Oct. 8, 2008. Futures are up 15 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for January settlement increased $1.82, or
2 percent, to end the session at $90.69 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest close
since Oct. 1, 2008.  The ECB will keep offering banks unlimited loans through
the first quarter over periods of seven days, one month and
three months. That marks a shift from last month, when Trichet
said that the ECB could start limiting access to its funds.  ‘Uncertainty is Elevated’  “Uncertainty is elevated,” Trichet told reporters after
the ECB’s Governing Council left its benchmark interest rate at
1 percent today. “We have tensions and we have to take them
into account.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 1.2 percent to
1,220.26 at 3:25 p.m. in New York and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  climbed 0.9 percent to 11,356.51. The dollar declined
0.6 percent to $1.3216 per euro from $1.3139 yesterday. The
 Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities increased
1 percent to 312.1, the highest level since Nov. 11.  “The dollar has been a major contributory factor and also
some of the economic data,” said  Jason Schenker , president of
Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy
consultant. “We have non-farm payrolls out tomorrow, and that’s
going to be very important.”  The number of applications for jobless benefits  averaged 
431,000 a week over the month ended Nov. 27, the lowest level
since August 2008, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The department may report tomorrow that employers
added 150,000 workers last month and the  unemployment rate  held
at 9.6 percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Retail Sales  U.S. November retail comparable store sales rose 5.3
percent versus a 3.5 percent estimate,  Ken Perkins , president of
Swampscott, Massachusetts-based Retail Metrics, said in an
interview.  Oil “is being moved around by macro issues more than by
supply and demand,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist
at Deutsche Bank in Washington.  Along with the gain in oil gasoline surged to the highest
level since May after stockpiles in the U.S. Northeast fell.
Inventories along the East Coast declined 1.8 percent last week,
an Energy Department report showed yesterday. Irving Oil Corp.
said that it shut a unit at its Saint John refinery in New
Brunswick, which supplies New York Harbor, the delivery point
for the Nymex contract.  “The cash market in New York Harbor is trading at a
premium to Nymex futures and pulling crude oil higher,” said
 Hamza Khan , an analyst with Schork Group Inc., a consulting
company in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “Today’s rally actually has
a fundamental basis.”  Gasoline Rally  Gasoline for January delivery gained 5.49 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.3553 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since May 3. Reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, for
 prompt delivery  in New York Harbor rose 4.81 cents, or 2
percent, to $2.4185.  Crude oil  supplies  climbed 1.07 million barrels to 359.7
million in the week ended Nov. 26, the report showed.  Stockpiles 
at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York futures,
increased 910,000 barrels to 34.5 million.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 632,452 contracts as of 3:17
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 621,347
contracts yesterday, 11 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.36 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
