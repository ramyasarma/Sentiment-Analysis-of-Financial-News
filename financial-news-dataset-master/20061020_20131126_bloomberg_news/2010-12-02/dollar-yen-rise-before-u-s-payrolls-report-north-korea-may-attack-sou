The dollar rose toward a two-month
high against the euro amid signs the U.S. labor market is
improving while Europe struggles to contain its debt crisis.  The greenback gained versus 11 of 16 major peers before
government data on payrolls tomorrow and as military tensions on
the Korean peninsula supported demand for safe-haven assets.
Australia’s dollar dropped after data showed retail sales
unexpectedly fell. Taiwan’s dollar surged on prospects global
funds will buy more of the island’s assets.  “Recent good economic data are supportive of the dollar,”
said Takayuki Asahara, a dealer in Tokyo at Shinkin Central
Bank, the central institution for Japan’s financial
cooperatives. “Further gains can be expected should the job
data tomorrow be positive.”  The dollar climbed to $1.3103 per euro as of 1:52 p.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3139 in New York yesterday, after touching $1.2969
on Nov. 30, the strongest since Sept. 15. It was at 84.08 yen
from 84.19 yen. The euro fell to 110.20 yen from 110.58 yen.  U.S. employers added 145,000 workers last month after a
151,000 gain in October, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before the Labor Department report tomorrow.  The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book showed yesterday
hiring improved, manufacturing expanded and retailers
anticipated a stronger holiday shopping season. ADP Employer
Services reported yesterday employment increased by 93,000 last
month, the most since November 2007. The median projection of
economists in another Bloomberg survey was for a 70,000 gain.  Korean Tensions  North Korea may attack the province that surrounds Seoul,
the Tokyo Shimbun newspaper said, citing an unidentified person
who quoted an official in the communist nation. South Korea will
hold artillery drills on Yeonpyeong, the island shelled by the
North last week, on Dec. 6, television broadcaster MBN reported
today, citing government officials it didn’t identify.  Japan and the U.S. will conduct a joint military exercise
from tomorrow until Dec. 10.  “Geopolitical risk appears to be returning a bit on
worries that North Korea may attack the South,” said  Satoshi Okagawa , head of the foreign-exchange and money trading group in
Singapore at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest banking group. “There’s some safe-haven buying of
the yen and the dollar.”  Australia Sales  The Australian dollar fell against all of its most-traded
peers after the Bureau of Statistics said retail sales declined
1.1 percent in October. That compared with the 0.4 percent gain
estimated by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  There was “very weak consumer spending over the past few
months in Australia, so that’s certainly weighing on the
Aussie,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in Singapore.  The so-called Aussie slipped to 96.40 U.S. cents from 96.83
cents and declined to 81.05 yen from 81.53 yen yesterday.  Taiwan’s dollar rose for the first time in three days as
overseas investors bought $6.6 billion more local shares than
they sold this year. The island’s  economy  expanded 9.8 percent
in the third quarter from a year earlier and will grow 9.98
percent this year and 4.51 percent in 2011, the government said
Nov. 18.  “Growth in Taiwan and other Asian economies attracts
overseas funds,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The
central bank will continue to act to reduce gains.”  Taiwan Dollar  The Taiwan dollar strengthened to NT$30.369 versus the
greenback from NT$30.852 yesterday.  The euro’s decline may be limited on speculation European
Central Bank policy makers will today announce steps to stem the
region’s debt crisis. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
the bank will keep its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent.  “The markets are expecting the ECB to do something,” said
Khoon Goh, head of market economics and strategy at ANZ National
Bank Ltd. in Wellington. “The euro seems to be supported, but
it needs some concrete action coming from the ECB and other
officials to say the right things.”  Speculation the debt crisis will spread to Portugal and
Spain grew after European authorities approved an 85 billion-
euro ($111.5 billion) aid package for Ireland on Nov. 28 when it
became the second euro-area nation after Greece to seek
financial help.  To contact the reporters on this story:
