Gold may rise for a fourth day in New
York as concern about Europe’s debt crisis spurs demand for a
protection of wealth and as China’s bullion imports surged.
Palladium climbed to a nine-year high.  China’s gold imports jumped almost fivefold in the first 10
months from the entire amount last year as concern about rising
inflation increased gold’s appeal, the Shanghai Gold Exchange
said. The dollar fell against the euro as the European Central
Bank left interest rates at a record low and as investors waited
to see if the bank will expand stimulus measures to fight the
region’s debt crisis. Gold futures reached a record $1,424.30 an
ounce on Nov. 9.  “While the return of risk appetite hasn’t crimped gold’s
safe-haven appeal, decent resistance is blocking the yellow
metal’s return to $1,400,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG in
London, said in a report. “Market attention today will be
focused on the European Central Bank meeting,” and the Chinese
import comments “have added to gold’s appeal,” she said.  Gold futures for February delivery added $1.10, or 0.1
percent, to $1,389.40 an ounce at 8:01 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices yesterday reached $1,398.30, the highest level
since Nov. 12. The metal for immediate delivery in London was
0.1 percent higher at $1,389.18.  Bullion rose to $1,390 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,385.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  The euro this week fell to a two-month low versus the
dollar as concern deepened that the region’s debt crisis would
spread. Policy makers today kept their benchmark rate at 1
percent. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  will hold a press
conference in Frankfurt from 8:30 a.m. New York time.  China Imports Gain  China’s imports gained to 209 metric tons compared with 45
tons for all of 2009,  Shen Xiangrong , chairman of the bourse,
told a conference in Shanghai today. The country is the world’s
largest bullion producer and the second-biggest user. Investment
demand in China may reach 150 tons this year, up from 105 tons
last year,  Albert Cheng , managing director of the World Gold
Council’s Far East department, told a conference in Shanghai
today.  “People there need to buy gold to hedge against inflation
as the country’s tightening monetary policy drives investors
from stocks and properties to gold,” said  Hiroyuki Kikukawa ,
general manager of research at IDO Securities Co. in Tokyo.
China’s demand will continue to grow, making the country one of
the top importers together with India, he said.  Gold Assets  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products rose 7.65 tons to
2,094.48 tons yesterday, the highest amount since Oct. 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14. Silver
holdings gained 71.45 tons to 14,851.49 tons, data from four
providers show.  Silver for March delivery in New York added 0.1 percent to
$28.45 an ounce. The metal is up 69 percent this year and
yesterday touched $28.88, the highest level since Nov. 9, when
it reached a 30-year high of $29.34.  Palladium for March delivery rose as much as 3.1 percent to
$754.75 an ounce, the highest price since April 2001, and was
last at $741. Platinum for January delivery was 1.3 percent
higher at $1,706.70 an ounce.  Platinum and palladium are used to make pollution-control
devices for cars. U.S. sales of light vehicles rose 17 percent
in November, Autodata Corp. said yesterday. The seasonally
adjusted annual sales rate was 12.3 million, matching the
October rate that was the fastest since the U.S. government’s
“cash for clunkers” program in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
