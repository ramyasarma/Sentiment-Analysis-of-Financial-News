Paul Allen , the co-founder of
Microsoft Corp., will give Washington State University $26
million for its  School for Global Animal Health .  Allen attended the university based in Pullman, Washington,
for two years and the gift is his largest to any educational
institution, said David Postman, a spokesman for  Vulcan Inc. , a
company Allen founded in 1986. The donation will be given in
stages and will fund a building and support programs in Africa,
Postman said in a phone interview today.  Allen, 57, has a fortune valued at $13.5 billion, according
to Forbes magazine. Allen founded  Microsoft  in 1975 with Bill
Gates before leaving in 1983 and is the owner of the Portland
Trail Blazers basketball team and the Seattle Seahawks football
team. The gift to Washington State follows Allen’s interest in
African wildlife, Postman said.  “He’s always been interested in wildlife conservation,”
Postman said. “He’s become focused in the interaction between
people and animals and this is a way to promote research at
Pullman and on the ground in Africa.”  Washington State was founded in 1890 and has about 24,000
students at four campuses. Graduates include the late  Edward R. Murrow , a broadcaster, and  Gary Larson , who created the Far Side
cartoon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
