Eskom Holdings Ltd., South Africa’s
state-owned electricity utility, said Moody’s Investors Service
Inc.’s announcement yesterday lifting the negative outlook on
Eskom’s Baa2 bonds to stable was “fitting.”  “Eskom views this rating amendment favorably and views it
as a further enabler to its commitment to delivering the much
needed capacity whilst maintaining the financial sustainability
of the company,” according to an e-mailed statement from the
Johannesburg-based utility today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
