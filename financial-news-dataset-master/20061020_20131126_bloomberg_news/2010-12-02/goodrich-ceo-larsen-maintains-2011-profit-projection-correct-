Goodrich Corp. , an aerospace-parts
maker, expects recovery in all its commercial and defense
markets next year, even with a possible seventh delay to Boeing
Co.’s 787 Dreamliner.  Goodrich is seeing “very solid, organic growth in every
one of our market segments,” Chief Executive Officer  Marshall Larsen  said today at the Credit Suisse Aerospace & Defense
Conference in New York. Larsen said he’s working to improve
profit margins through more efficient production as well as
manufacturing in lower-cost countries.  Earnings next year will reach as much as $5.20 per share,
he said, matching the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company’s
October  forecast .  A possible seventh delay to the 787 Dreamliner, after a
fire last month hampered flight testing, will have no effect on
Goodrich’s 2011 profit because margins in the early stages of a
plane program are very low, Larsen said after his presentation.  Goodrich should find out in the near future whether its bid
for more work on Airbus SAS’s single-aisle A320, which is
offering new engines, was accepted, Larsen said. Research and
development costs for any work Goodrich wins have been built
into the forecast, he said.  Goodrich climbed 74 cents to $86.64 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange  composite trading . The shares have gained 35
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
