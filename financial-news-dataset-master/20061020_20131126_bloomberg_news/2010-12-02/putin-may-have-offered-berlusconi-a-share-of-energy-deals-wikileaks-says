Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
may have promised his Italian counterpart  Silvio Berlusconi  a
percentage of profits on projects developed by  OAO Gazprom  with
 Eni SpA , a U.S.  diplomatic cable  posted on WikiLeaks.org shows.  “The Georgian ambassador in Rome has told us” that his
government “believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a percentage
of profits from any pipelines developed by Gazprom in
coordination with Eni,” U.S. Ambassador  Ronald P. Spogli  said
in a cable sent on Jan. 26, 2009, according to the leaked
document.  Spogli also said “contacts” in both Italy’s opposition
Democratic Party and the prime minister’s own People of Freedom
Party “believe that Berlusconi and his cronies are profiting
personally and handsomely from many of the energy deals between
Italy and Russia,” according to the document posted late last
night on WikiLeaks website.  Berlusconi said on the sidelines of a meeting in the Kazakh
capital Astana today that “the U.S. knows I have absolutely no
interest in any other country, that there aren’t personal
interests, but that I only care about the interests of Italians
and of my country," Italian news agency Ansa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
