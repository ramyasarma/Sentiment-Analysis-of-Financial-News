EBay Inc. , owner of the second-most
visited U.S. e-commerce site, said it bought shopping engine
Milo.com to help it reach more consumers looking for products in
nearby stores and browsing for bargains with mobile phones.  Milo.com helps consumers find items in stock at local
stores and EBay will weave the technology into its existing
marketplace and mobile applications, the San Jose-based company
said today in a statement. It didn’t disclose deal terms.  EBay Chief Executive Officer  John Donahoe , halfway through
a three-year turnaround campaign, is looking for ways to use the
company’s  $5.4 billion in cash  to lure customers and narrow a
growth gap with Amazon.com Inc., the e-commerce leader.  “Local commerce companies like Milo are blurring the lines
between in-store and online shopping,”  Mark Carges , a senior
vice president at EBay, said in the statement.  Milo.com, based in Palo Alto, California, will help EBay
add products to its online marketplace and help consumers find
the best prices, the company said.  EBay raised $1.5 billion through the sales of bonds in
October, saying the proceeds may be used for acquisitions.  Milo.com, founded in 2007, aggregates products from 140
merchants and about 50,000 stores in the U.S.  EBay rose 65 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $29.91 at 4 p.m. New
York time in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
