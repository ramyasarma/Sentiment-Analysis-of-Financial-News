Natural gas futures rose for a second
day in New York on forecasts of below-normal temperatures that
may boost demand for the heating fuel.  Futures climbed as colder weather is likely in the
Northeast, Southeast and Midwest from Dec. 7 through Dec. 16,
according to Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prices fluctuated after the Energy Department reported a
stockpile decline that was smaller than analysts predicted.  “This is a weather trade,” said  Gordon Elliott , a risk-
management specialist with FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park,
Minnesota. “People are going to trade on the forecasts, whether
they actually pan out or not.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose 7.4 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $4.343 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising as high as
$4.377 and dropping to $4.197. Gas futures have declined 22
percent this year.  Inventories fell 23 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Nov. 26 to 3.814 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
said. The median of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg
showed a decline of 29 billion. A separate survey of Bloomberg
users released five minutes before the stockpile report also
showed an expected decrease of 29 billion.  The stockpile drop was smaller than the five-year average
withdrawal for the week of 36 billion cubic feet, department
data show. A surplus to the five-year average rose to 10 percent
from 9.5 percent the previous week. A deficit to year-earlier
supplies widened to 0.6 percent from 0.1 percent.  Cold Weather  Heating demand from Dec. 8 through Dec. 12 may be 15
percent above normal levels, according to  David Salmon , a
meteorologist with Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  “Prices are still seeing a bit of support because of the
cooler outlook coming in through mid-December,” said  Matt Smith , an analyst with Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky.
“The forecasts are colder, especially for the key consuming
regions of the Northeast and Southeast.”  The low temperature in New York on Dec. 11 may be 26
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 Celsius), 5 degrees below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.
The low temperature in Chicago may be 17 Fahrenheit, 7 degrees
below normal.  “There will be a swath of snow with this system from the
northern Plains to the middle Atlantic coast,” wrote Paul
Pastelok, senior forecaster for AccuWeather, in a note to
clients. “Another press of cold will follow and could lead to a
freeze into Florida.”  Hub Price  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 7.13 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $4.282 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange, the fourth
consecutive increase.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
249,882 as of 3:01 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
272,000. Volume was 238,711 yesterday. Open interest was 765,847
contracts, compared with the three-month average of 798,000. The
