Soybeans rose to a two-week high as
demand increased in China, the world’s largest consumer. Corn
futures declined.  U.S.  exporters  sold 1.342 million metric tons of soybeans
in the week ended Nov. 26, almost double the previous week, when
prices in Chicago dropped 5.3 percent, the Department of
Agriculture said today. China was the principal buyer.  Sales  for
delivery in the marketing year that began Sept. 1 are 19 percent
higher than a year ago, government data show.  “Export sales improved last week because China returned,”
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines, Iowa. “Today’s sales report shows that there is
underlying demand for U.S. soybeans when prices decline.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 1.75 cents, or
0.1 percent, to $12.8475 a bushel at 12:28 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $12.87, the highest since Nov.
16. Before today, the oilseed gained 42 percent since the end of
June as China’s demand surged and hot, dry weather reduced U.S.
yields.  Corn futures for March delivery slipped 1.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $5.6475 in Chicago. Yesterday, the price climbed 4.1
percent, the biggest gain since Oct. 20, on speculation demand
will increase for U.S. inventories.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter of both
commodities. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6
billion in 2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans
at $31.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
