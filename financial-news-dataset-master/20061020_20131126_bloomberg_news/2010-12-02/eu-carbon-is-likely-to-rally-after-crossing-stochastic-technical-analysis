European Union carbon permits
advanced after crossing so-called stochastic indicators, and may
rise further, according to Orbeo.  The slow stochastic oscillators “crossed over yesterday”
providing a buying signal to the market,  Carine Hemery , a Paris-
based analyst at Orbeo, a carbon venture between Societe
Generale SA and Rhodia SA, said by telephone today.  The oscillator measures the closing price of a security
relative to its highs and lows during a particular period to try
to predict whether prices will rise or fall. The chart signals
an increase when its “k-line,” based on a formula that uses
the highest and lowest prices in a set period, climbs above its
own moving average, or “d-line.”  EU permits for December gained 16 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
15 euros ($19.79) a metric ton as of 10:15 a.m. on London’s
European Climate Exchange. Permits hit a two-week low of 14.76
euros on Nov. 30. The next resistance level is 15.07 euros,
Hemery said, citing patterns in previous price moves.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns to predict changes in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
