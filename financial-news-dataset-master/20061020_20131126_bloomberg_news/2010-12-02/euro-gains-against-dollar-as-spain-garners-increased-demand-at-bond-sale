The euro advanced for a second day
against the dollar after Spain sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.3
billion) of debt in the first bond auction since Ireland’s
bailout.  The 16-nation currency climbed 0.4 percent to $1.3189 at
10:13 a.m. in London, after earlier losing as much as 0.4
percent. The euro bought 110.99 yen, from 1110.58 yesterday.  Demand for the Spanish debt was 2.27 times the amount sold,
compared with a bid-to-cover of 2.16 at an October sale.  The dollar fell the most against the South African rand and
the New Zealand dollar before a report economists said will show
the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy previously
owned homes fell in October for a second month, fueling a
concern the economic recovery may stall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
