UniCredit SpA , Italy’s biggest bank,
plans to open 900 branches in central and eastern Europe in the
next five years to tap faster growing markets.  The Milan-based bank is ready to finance expansion in the
region without a capital increase, Chief Executive Officer
 Federico Ghizzoni  said at an  investor meeting  in London today.
The parent company will continue to receive dividends from its
units in the area, he said.  UniCredit, the biggest lender in emerging Europe with
107.6 billion euros ($141 billion) of assets, said in November
that third-quarter pretax profit in the region more than tripled
to 366 million euros. The bank, which operates in 22 countries,
said it plans to focus on the bigger markets in the area, such
as Russia, Poland and Turkey.  “Operating profit in the region will improve, while loan-
loss provisions are expected to normalize” and asset quality is getting better, Ghizzoni  said.  UniCredit rose 1 percent to 1.60 euros at 12:25 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 31 billion euros.  
The Bloomberg Banks and Financial Services Index , which was up
0.4 percent today, has risen 4 percent in the past six months,
compared with UniCredit’s 3 percent decline.  Poland and Turkey  The Italian lender plans to expand its  Bank Pekao SA  Polish
unit by opening new branches and strengthening the existing
network, Pekao General Manager  Luigi Lovaglio  said. Pekao,
Poland’s second-largest bank, posted a 6.3 percent gain in
third-quarter profit as lending revenue increased. The division
is benefiting from accelerating growth in Poland, which expanded
at a faster-than-estimated 3.5 percent in the second quarter.  “We will keep our eyes open in Poland,” where economic
growth will benefit the loan market, Ghizzoni said. Pekao may
review its dividend policy in coming months, “going back to a
pre-crisis 70-80 percent payout ratio,” Lovaglio said.  UniCredit also plans to expand organically in Turkey, where
it owns 50 percent of  Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS , Deputy CEO
 Alessandro Decio  said. The unit aims to increase its loans and
deposits by more than 20 percent in the next five years, opening
about 60 branches annually “to guarantee a return on equity
around the current level of 20 percent,” he said.  Fragile Markets  Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan are among the
more “fragile” countries where UniCredit operates, the CEO
said. “The Kazakhstan unit is not on sale, as we are
concentrated on its restructuring.”  UniCredit bought Kazakhstan’s AO ATF Bank, the fifth-
largest lender in the country, for $2.1 billion in 2007. It
wrote down the value of the unit by 162 million euros in the
second quarter because of bad loans.  In Russia, ZAO UniCredit Bank is among potential candidates
to advise the country’s government on privatizations planned in
coming years, Ghizzoni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
