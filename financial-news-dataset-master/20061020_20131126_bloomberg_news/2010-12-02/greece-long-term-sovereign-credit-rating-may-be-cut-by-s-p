Greece had its ‘BB+’ long-term
sovereign credit rating placed on CreditWatch with negative
implications by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which said
it is assessing the credit implications of the proposed European
Stability Mechanism that may govern EU sovereign bonds beginning
in July 2013.  “Assigning ‘preferred creditor’ status to future official
lending via the ESM could be detrimental to the ability of non-
official holders of sovereign debt to be repaid,” S&P said in a
statement.  S&P took the move as details of the plan are still
emerging, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
