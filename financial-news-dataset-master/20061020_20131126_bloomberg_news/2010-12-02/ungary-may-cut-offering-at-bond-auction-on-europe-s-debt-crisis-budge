Hungary raised more debt than planned
at a sale of government bonds today as borrowing costs jumped on
concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will spread and the
country’s budget won’t be sustainable.  The government sold 51 billion forint ($242 million) in
bonds due in 2014, 2016 and 2020, 11 billion forint more than
initially planned, according to auction results on the debt
management agency’s Bloomberg page. Yields on the auctioned
maturities rose between 79 basis points and 94 basis points
compared with yields at the last auction two weeks ago.  Bond yields have risen across Europe since Hungary last
sold government bonds on Nov. 18 as Ireland’s bailout fueled
speculation that more countries may seek aid. The central bank
in Budapest on Nov. 29 unexpectedly raised its  benchmark
interest rate , citing accelerating inflation and the country’s
worsening risk assessment.  The state raised 25 billion forint in 2014 bonds at an
average yield of 7.9 percent, compared with 6.96 percent, 13
billion forint of debt maturing in 2016 at 7.93 percent versus
7.17 percent and 13 billion forint of 2020 notes at 8.08 percent
compared with 7.29 percent. The agency received bids totaling
165.7 billion forint compared with 186.9 billion.  “This was a very strong auction with demand boosted by an
improvement in global sentiment,”  Gyorgy Cselenyi , head of
interest-rate trading at BNP Paribas SA in Budapest, said in a
phone interview. With the start of the new U.S. financial year
on Dec. 1, liquidity on markets rose and American investors
“appear to be opening long emerging market positions,” he
said.  Hungary raised more debt than planned at the last bond sale
in November, when bids were more than four times the offered 45
billion forint. The government raised 68.5 billion forint of at
the auction and subsequent non-competitive offering, selling
bonds maturing in 2014, 2016 and 2020 as costs rose.  The debt management agency failed to sell planned amount in
a sale of three-month Treasury bills on Nov. 30 and accepted no
bids at a buyback auction yesterday.  ‘Unsettled’  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank unexpectedly increased its two-week
deposit rate to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent after holding
borrowing costs unchanged at a record low for six months. That
move “unsettled” Hungarian debt pricing and caused some
investors to adopt a “wait-and-see” attitude,  Laszlo Andras Borbely , the Debt Management Agency’s deputy director, said in a
phone interview yesterday.  “The market hasn’t yet settled after the rate increase,
pricing has become more uncertain, since it’s unclear what the
central bank’s future policy steps will be,”  Borbely  said.  The rate decision affected bond demand, causing the
government to cut the planned amount in a debt sale Nov. 30 and
to accept no bids at a buyback auction yesterday, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
