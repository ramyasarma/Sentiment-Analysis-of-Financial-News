Japan’s  10-year bonds  declined for an
eighth week, the longest stretch since April 2006, as signs the
U.S. economic recovery is gaining momentum damped demand for the
relative safety of debt.  Benchmark 10-year yields were at a five-month high as local
stocks headed for a fifth-weekly gain and before data that may
show U.S. employers added jobs for a second month. Japan’s 30-
year bonds completed a weekly loss on speculation investors
reduced holdings to prepare for an auction next week.  “Investors don’t want to make big moves today before the
U.S. jobs data,” said  Akio Kato , Tokyo-based team leader for
Japanese debt at Kokusai Asset Management Co., which runs the
$36.6 billion Global Sovereign Open fund. “They are hesitant to
buy bonds now because they may be able to get them cheaper later.
Market sentiment continues to be negative for bonds.”  The yield on the 1.2 percent bond due December 2020 rose
half a basis point to 1.205 percent as of 3:01 p.m. in Tokyo at
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price fell 0.045 yen to 99.955 yen. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The yield is at the highest since June 22 and has increased
1.5 basis points this week.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery fell 0.06 to
140.88 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. payrolls rose by 150,000 in November after increasing
by 151,000 the previous month, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before today’s Labor Department report.
Earlier this week, a report by ADP Employer Services showed
businesses added 93,000 workers to payrolls in November, the
most in three years.  “Upcoming U.S. jobs data are likely to weigh on investor
appetite to buy new 10-year bonds on dips with 1.2 percent
yields,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo
Securities Co., wrote today in a note to clients.  An auction of 10-year bonds on Dec. 1 drew bids for 2.41
times the amount on offer, the lowest so-called bid-to-cover
ratio since July 2009.  The Ministry of Finance will sell 600 billion yen ($7.2
billion) of 30-year securities on Dec. 7. Primary dealers, which
are required to bid at government debt sales, often reduce
holdings of bonds in case prices decline before they can pass on
the new securities to investors. Thirty-year rates gained 2.5
basis points to 2.105 percent this week.  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a 1.8
percent return this year, according to an index compiled by
Merrill Lynch & Co.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.1 percent today and
advanced 1.4 percent this week. Treasury 10-year yields
yesterday climbed above 3 percent for the first time since July.  Japan’s 10-year yields may rise to 1.3 percent by the end
of this month, according to Kokusai’s Kato. Should his forecast
prove accurate, investors who buy the securities will incur a
0.8 percent loss, Bloomberg calculations show.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect yields to be
1.06 percent at the end of this year. The estimate puts a
heavier weighting on more recent forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
