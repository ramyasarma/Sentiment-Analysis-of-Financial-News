France’s unemployment rate was
unchanged in the third quarter as employers hesitated over
hiring more than a year after the country exited its worst
recession since World War II.  The jobless rate held at 9.7 percent in the three months
through September, Paris-based statistics office Insee said
today. Economists expected a rate of 9.8 percent, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 10
percent at the end of last year as companies ranging from car
manufacturer  PSA Peugeot Citroen  to cosmetics maker L’Oreal SA
began hiring. Even so, the limited gains highlight concerns
about the strength of the rebound at a time when President
 Nicolas Sarkozy ’s government is squeezing expenses and the
global recovery is slowing.  Excluding French overseas territories, the unemployment
rate was unchanged at 9.3 percent in the quarter, Insee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
