Former England captain David Beckham,
a key member of the nation’s campaign to host soccer’s 2018
World Cup, said the bid team did all it could to secure the
event.  Russia won the vote of ruling body FIFA today in Zurich,
while Qatar was chosen to host the 2022 event. England got only
two of the 22 votes in the first round and was eliminated, FIFA
said.  “I think the bid team have done everything possible, we
couldn’t have got a better bid,” Beckham told the British
Broadcasting Corp.’s Radio Five Live.  “We’re disappointed but we wish Qatar and Russia the very
best, they’re two great countries and I’m sure they’ll make FIFA
very proud.  ‘‘It’s obviously hard to not come away with the World Cup
in 2018 but a lot of congratulations have to go to the team, a
lot of hard work has been done. With the Prime Minister’s hard
work and Prince William’s hard work, the whole bid team has been
exceptional.  ‘‘It would be great to bring the World Cup to our country
because we’ve not had it for so many years but it’s a process
I’ve enjoyed.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
