U.S. stocks advanced, giving the Dow
Jones Industrial Average its biggest two-day rally since July,
as purchases of existing homes unexpectedly jumped, retail sales
topped analysts’ estimates and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended buying financial shares.  PulteGroup Inc. , the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
advanced 3.2 percent after pending sales of existing homes
increased by a record 10 percent in October.  Home Depot Inc. 
climbed 5.5 percent, leading gains in the Dow, as retail sales
rose the most since March.  Bank of America Corp.  and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. drove financial shares to the biggest advance in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after Goldman Sachs said the
economic outlook is “supportive” for the industry.  The S&P 500 rose 1.3 percent to 1,221.53 at 4 p.m. in New
York after gaining 2.2 percent yesterday. The last time the
measure posted two straight advances exceeding 1 percent was in
February. The  Dow  gained 106.63 points, or 1 percent, to
11,362.41. Both gauges are up more than 3.2 percent in December.  “The market is telling us that the economy is doing better
than expected,” said  Hank Smith , chief investment officer at
Haverford Trust Co., which manages about $6.5 billion in Radnor,
Pennsylvania. “Buying financial stocks is one way to play the
improvement in the macroeconomic environment.”  The S&P 500 is up 19 percent from this year’s low in July
as companies reported higher-than-estimated earnings and the
Federal Reserve increased its program of asset purchases to
stimulate growth. The index had fallen as much as 3.9 percent
from a two-year high on Nov. 5 amid investor concern that the
European debt crisis would hamper economic growth.  S&P 500 at 1,450  The  benchmark for U.S. equities  rose 2.2 percent yesterday,
its biggest advance since Sept. 1, amid improving data on the
U.S. and China economies and speculation of a larger European
financial rescue. Goldman Sachs’ investment strategist  David Kostin  said the S&P 500 may rise to 1,450 by the end of next
year, a gain of more than 20 percent from yesterday’s close, as
the economic recovery accelerates.  Earlier today, U.S. equities advanced as European Central
Bank policy makers meeting in Frankfurt kept the benchmark
 interest rate  at a record low of 1 percent and delayed the
bank’s exit from emergency liquidity measures as the debt crisis
threatens to engulf Portugal and Spain. The ECB didn’t announce
new measures to halt the crisis.  U.S. stock futures maintained gains before the open of
exchanges as fewer Americans filed claims for unemployment
insurance payments over the  past month , showing the job market
is improving. The number of applications for jobless benefits
averaged 431,000 a week over the month ended Nov. 27, the lowest
level since August 2008, Labor Department figures showed.  Claims 
increased by 26,000 last week, more than forecast, to 436,000,
after reaching a two-year low.  ‘Picking Up Strength’  “We’re picking up strength,” said  Tom Wirth , senior
investment officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co., which manages
$1.5 billion in Elmira, New York. “Almost every data point we
get over here is telling us no double-dip recession.”  A measure of 12  homebuilders  in S&P indexes rallied 3.9
percent, as all of its companies gained at least 2.2 percent.
Pending sales of U.S. existing houses unexpectedly jumped a
record 10 percent in October, the National Association of
Realtors said. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 1 percent decrease. The group’s data go back to 2001.  PulteGroup  rose 3.2 percent to $6.75.  D.R. Horton Inc. , the
second-largest U.S. builder, advanced 3.7 percent to $10.92.
Lennar Corp., the third-biggest, jumped 7.2 percent to $16.88.  Retail Sales  Retail sales rose the most in eight months in November, led
by  Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  and J.C. Penney Co., and beat
analysts’ estimates as consumers gobbled up discounts,
particularly during the Thanksgiving weekend.  Teen retailer Abercrombie had the second-biggest gain in
the S&P 500, rallying 11 percent to $56.02. Same-store sales
rose 22 percent, above the 6.4 percent average of analysts’
estimates compiled by Retail Metrics Inc.  J.C. Penney  rose 2.3
percent to $34.47 as the third-largest U.S. department store
chain boosted sales 9.2 percent, above a 3.3 percent projection.  Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
rose the most in the Dow, advancing 5.5 percent to $33.36.  “Retail sales numbers in the U.S. are quite strong and
that’s a positive for stocks,” said  David Abella , a money
manager at Rochdale Investment Management LLC in New York, which
has $3 billion under management. “The news out of the U.S.
seems to be slowly improving.”  Overweight Financials  Financial stocks climbed 2.6 percent, the most among 10
industries in the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs upgraded the group to
“overweight,” the first positive recommendation since 2008, as
strong economic growth, higher stock prices and a helpful
interest rate environment will help financial services
companies, the bank’s U.S. portfolio strategy team wrote in a
note to investors yesterday.  Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, climbed 3.5
percent to $11.68, and  JPMorgan Chase , the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, rose 3 percent to $39.31.  Marshall & Ilsley
Corp.  gained 12 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $5.48.  Sprint Nextel Corp. , the third-largest U.S. mobile phone
carrier, gained 2.4 percent to $3.86.  Clearwire Corp. , the high-
speed wireless network carrier 54 percent owned by Sprint, said
it plans to sell at least $1.1 billion of debt after saying last
month it may not have enough funding to keep operating.
Clearwire tumbled 13 percent to $5.90.  To contact the reporters on this story:
