European stocks  rose, sending the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index to its biggest two-day rally since July,
as the European Central Bank extended an emergency loan program
and housing data bolstered confidence in the U.S. economy.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company, led
commodity companies higher.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  paced
gains among carmakers, surging to a record high, after U.S.
sales last month jumped 30 percent. Hochtief AG led construction
companies higher as Russia and Qatar won the rights host
soccer’s World Cup.  The Stoxx 600 gained 1.7 percent to 271.61 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, its highest level since Nov. 15. The gauge
jumped 2 percent yesterday amid speculation ECB policy makers
may step up measures to contain the region’s worsening
sovereign-debt crisis.  “The ECB’s decision to delay the withdrawal of the
emergency liquidity measures is clearly positive for stocks,”
said  Henrik Lundin , chief strategist at Nordea Bank AB. “The
ECB has been too hawkish given the risk of an extended debt
crisis and today’s step is definitely a leap in the right
direction.”  Market Tensions  The ECB also bought more government bonds as President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  pledged to fight “acute” financial market
tensions. The central bank will offer banks unlimited loans
through the first quarter over periods of seven days, one month
and three months,  Trichet  told reporters at a press conference 
in Frankfurt.  Irish and Portuguese bonds surged as ECB officials embarked
on a new round of debt purchases, according to traders with

European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 jumped 2.2 percent,
France’s CAC gained 2.1 percent and Germany’s DAX advanced 1.3
percent.  Stocks extended gains after a report showed pending sales
of U.S. existing houses unexpectedly jumped by a record 10
percent in October, indicating the industry at the center of the
last recession is stabilizing as the job market improves.  Another report showed claims for jobless benefits over the
past month on average dropped to a two-year low. Combined with
figures showing chain-store sales topped estimates last month,
the reports added to evidence the world’s largest economy is
strengthening.  BHP, BMW  BHP Billiton advanced 3.7 percent to 2,450 pence in London
