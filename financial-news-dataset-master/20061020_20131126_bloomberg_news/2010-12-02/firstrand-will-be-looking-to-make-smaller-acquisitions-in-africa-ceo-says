FirstRand Ltd ., South Africa’s
second-biggest financial-services company, said it plans to
expand in Nigeria, Tanzania, Angola, Ghana and Kenya through
acquisitions and internal growth.  The lender is adopting an “progressively aggressive
strategy” in Africa and once it has successfully entered those
five priority countries, it may explore expanding in Zimbabwe,
Uganda, the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon and Congo, Chief
Executive Officer  Sizwe Nxasana  said in a presentation in
Johannesburg today.  FirstRand will continue to allocate capital to its
businesses that meet required returns, while any excess may be
distributed to investors, he said.  The company already has operations in Namibia, Botswana,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia. FirstRand plans to
expand its investment-banking, retail and insurance offerings
across a continent that has more than 1 billion people. To pick
up Asian trade flows as companies target Africa’s resources, it
has set up an office in India and signed a working agreement
with China Construction Bank Corp.  FirstRand has received approval from the South African
central bank to open trade-finance and investment-banking
businesses in Kenya and plans to start operations in Tanzania
next year, Nxasana said.  FirstRand gained 35 cents, or 1.7 percent, to 20.64 rand as
of 12:23 p.m. in Johannesburg trading. The company is the
second-best performing banking stock on the five-member  FTSE/JSE
Africa Banks Index  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
