President  Barack Obama  predicted that
 LeBron James  is going to have a bumpy ride tonight playing
before the Cleveland fans he spurned to join the Miami Heat.  “Oh, that’s going to be brutal, isn’t it?” Obama said in
response to a question from reporters today on his way to a
meeting with newly elected governors across Pennsylvania Avenue
from the White House.  James, the two-time reigning Most Valuable Player of the
National Basketball Association, is from Akron, Ohio. He decided
to leave his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, this summer
to join the Heat, announcing his decision during a television
special. Fans in Cleveland burned replicas of his jersey and
Cavaliers owner  Dan Gilbert  called his departure a “cowardly
betrayal.”  James, 25, plays in Cleveland tonight for the first time as
a visitor. The Cavaliers have increased security at Quicken
Loans Arena and warned fans of inappropriate behavior.  Obama, 49, knows how brutal basketball can be: He got 12
stitches in his lip on Nov. 26 after being elbowed during a game
with friends. He said the stitches were removed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
