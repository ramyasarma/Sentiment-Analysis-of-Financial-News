Billionaire investor  Michael Price 
said  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  should divide its company into
three separate entities because the investment bank may be
getting too large.  “Goldman should split up into three parts,” Price said
today during a television interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “A banking business, a trading
business and a money management business.”  The most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history
could “free up some capital” and trade at the equivalent of
$250 a share if it split itself into three entities, Price,
president of MFP Investors LLC, said.  David Wells , a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment.  Price made his reputation as a value investor in the 1980s
by buying shares of beaten-down lenders and running some of the
best-performing mutual funds in the U.S.  Goldman Sachs shares  climbed  2.6 percent to $162.50 at 4
p.m. in New York. They have lost 3.8 percent this year,  compared
with  a 9.5 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a
5 percent rise by financial stocks in the measure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
