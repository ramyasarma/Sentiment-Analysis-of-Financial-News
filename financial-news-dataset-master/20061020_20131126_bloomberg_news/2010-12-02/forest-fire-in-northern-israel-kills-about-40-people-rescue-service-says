Some 40 people were killed when a bus
flipped over during a forest fire in northern Israel, Zaka
rescue service spokesman Moti Bukjin said.  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  called on the police and
army to help firefighters put out the blaze near the city of
Haifa.  “This is a disaster of a scope we haven’t seen,”
Netanyahu said in Jerusalem in remarks broadcast on Army Radio.  Several of the dead were security and emergency personnel
being evacuated from the site of the fire, police spokesman
 Micky Rosenfeld  said by phone.  “The fire came from all directions and trapped the bus,”
said Shimon Koren, Israeli police northern district commander.  To contact the reporter on this story:
