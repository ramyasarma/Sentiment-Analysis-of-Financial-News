Japanese  stock   futures  and Australian
shares rose as U.S. housing data and an extended emergency loan
program from the European Central Bank’s bolstered confidence in
a global economic recovery.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. , which is the
world’s biggest camera maker and gets more than 80 percent of
its sales abroad, climbed 1.3 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest
carmaker by sales, gained 0.7 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s No. 1 mining company and Australia’s biggest oil
producer, advanced 1.1 percent in Sydney today after metal
prices increased and crude climbed to a two-year high yesterday.  “The increase in pending home sales was a positive
surprise,” said  Juichi Wako , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 10,315 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,160 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,300
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose 0.8 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
advanced 0.5 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed today. The index climbed 1.3 percent yesterday in New
York, led by financial shares after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
raised its rating on the industry.  Housing, Jobs, Retail  Pending sales of U.S. existing houses jumped by a record 10
percent in October, the National Association of Realtors said
yesterday. That compares with a median estimate by 40 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg for a 1 percent drop. Separate reports
showed claims for jobless benefits over the past month on
average dropped to a two-year low, and that November chain-store
sales exceeded estimates.  European Central Bank policy makers meeting in Frankfurt
yesterday delayed the bank’s exit from emergency liquidity
measures as a crisis of government debt threatens to engulf
Portugal and Spain.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 9.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 9.5 percent by the S&P
500 and 7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.6 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 14.3 times for the S&P 500 and 12.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for January delivery jumped 1.4 percent in New
York yesterday to $88 a barrel, the highest settlement since Oct.
8, 2008. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 1.6 percent
yesterday, a third consecutive advance.  The 25-day Toraku index, a measure of daily stock winners
and losers in Tokyo, reached 124 yesterday, the highest level
since April 27. A level of more than 120 suggests to some
investors the market is overheating.  To contact the reporters on this story:
