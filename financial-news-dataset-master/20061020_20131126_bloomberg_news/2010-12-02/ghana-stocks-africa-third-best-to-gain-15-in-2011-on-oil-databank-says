(Corrects value of assets under management in second
paragraph.)  Ghana’s  stocks measure, Africa’s
third-best performer this year, is poised to rally as much as 15
percent in 2011 as companies gain from growth linked to the
start of oil output, Databank Group said.  The exchange’s  All-Share index  may rise to 8,338.65 by the
end of 2011, after climbing to 7,251 by this year’s end, said
Doris Yaa Ahiati, an analyst with the Accra-based group’s
 stockbroking unit . Databank’s  asset-management unit  oversees 250
million cedis ($173 million) of funds.  “We expect the market to benefit from oil production,
which will lift economic growth from about 5.9 percent this year
to 12.3 percent next year,” she said in an interview in Accra
yesterday.  The 36-member bourse, which plunged 47 percent in 2009 to
make it the world’s worst performer that year, has advanced 25
percent in 2010 because of “renewing interest from foreigners”
who fled investments perceived as risky during the global
economic crisis, Ahiati said. This month’s start of production
at the Jubilee oil field will spur growth in the West African
nation, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said last month.  “We foresee an increase in the demand of the goods of the
consumer stocks,” Ahiati said, citing  Unilever Ghana Ltd. ,  PZ
Cussons Ghana Ltd.  and  Fan Milk Ltd.   Tullow Oil Plc , the U.K.-based operator of the Jubilee
field, plans to list on the Ghanaian bourse next year, Accra-
based broadcaster Joy FM reported Nov. 29. Comet Properties Ltd.
will become the first real-estate company to trade shares on the
exchange after an initial public offering set for this month.  Aluworks Ghana Ltd. , a manufacturer of aluminum products
whose shares declined 57 percent this year, will benefit from
the restart of operations next year of the Volta Aluminium Co.,
which supplies raw material to the company, Ahiati said. Only
200 of the company’s shares changed hands last month.  Liquidity on the market will be boosted by a pension law
that allows employees to save part of their contributions with a
private fund means managers will “come to the market next year
grabbing whatever they get.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
