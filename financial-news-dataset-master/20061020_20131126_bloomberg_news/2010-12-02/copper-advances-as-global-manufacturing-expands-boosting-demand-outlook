Copper advanced in London and
Shanghai after manufacturing in China, the U.S. and Europe
expanded last month, adding to signs of a revival in demand.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose for a third day, by as much as 0.5 percent, to
$8,630.75 a metric ton, and traded at $8,620 a ton by 9:07 a.m.
Singapore time.  March-delivery copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed for a fourth day, by as much as 2.4 percent, to 65,200
yuan a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
