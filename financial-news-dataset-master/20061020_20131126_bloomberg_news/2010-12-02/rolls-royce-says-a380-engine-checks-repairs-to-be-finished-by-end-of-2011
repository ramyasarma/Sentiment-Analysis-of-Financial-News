Rolls-Royce Group Plc  will inspect
and fix all of its engines used on Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo
planes by the end of 2011, after a faulty part caused a blowout
on a flight and forced airlines to ground jets.  “In about a year’s time, all of the necessary components
will be in place and this will all be behind us,” Chief
Financial Officer  Andrew Shilston  told investors yesterday at
the Credit Suisse Aerospace & Defense Conference in New York.  The fix to the Trent 900 turbine involves replacing “a
small component inside the engine that’s not costly” Shilston
said in an interview afterward, declining to offer further
details. The company will shorten the recommended length of time
that the part is used before it’s replaced, he said.  Qantas Airways Ltd. is gradually reintroducing flights on
its fleet of six A380s, which was grounded for more than three
weeks after a Trent 900 engine exploded over Indonesia on Nov.
4, forcing an emergency return to Singapore. The A380, powered
by four engines, is the world’s largest passenger jet, seating
more than 500 people. Airbus has delivered 38 since 2007, and
there are 21 in service using Rolls-Royce turbines.  Analysts’ estimates that Trent 900 repairs will cost about
50 million pounds ($78 million) are “about” accurate for 2010,
Shilston said. The bulk of the expenses will be incurred this
year, though there may be some in 2011 as well, he said. That
figure includes the cost for maintenance and replacement of the
components as well as penalty payments to airlines, he said.  Rolls-Royce rose 9.5 pence to 618.5 pence yesterday in
London trading.  The shares  have gained 31 percent this year.  Dreamliner Engines  The London-based engine maker is “joined at the hip” with
Boeing Co. to get its Trent 1000 engine ready in time for the
787 Dreamliner to enter service next year, with no rework
required afterward, Shilston said.  Boeing blamed Rolls-Royce for the last delay to its new
composite-plastic jet, after an engine blew up during a test in
August, damaging the testing facility and pushing the plane’s
entry into service back by a quarter, into 2011. Chicago-based
Boeing is revising the 787’s schedule for a seventh time as it
redesigns part of the electrical system because of a fire during
a test flight last month.  The problems with the Trent 900 engines used on the A380
and the Trent 1000 turbines used on the Dreamliner “are
completely unconnected,” Shilston said. “They do not in any
way represent a systematic failure of our design technology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
