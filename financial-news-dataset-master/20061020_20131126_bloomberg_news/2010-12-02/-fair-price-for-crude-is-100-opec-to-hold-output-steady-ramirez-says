The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is unlikely to change its output quotas when
it meets in nine days time and $100 represents a “fair” price
for a barrel of oil, Venezuela’s energy minister said.  Gas-exporting nations also need an OPEC-like body to
“regulate” prices,  Rafael Ramirez  told reporters today. The
Venezuelan is one of several ministers attending a meeting in
Doha of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, a gas producers group
that does not set supply quotas.  Libya’s top oil official,  Shokri Ghanem , said yesterday in
Doha that OPEC is unlikely to change its oil production quotas
at the oil group’s Dec. 11 meeting in Quito, Ecuador.  Instead, oil ministers from the 12-nation group will seek
tighter compliance with OPEC’s existing output guidelines when
they meet, Ghanem said.  OPEC, which produces about 40 percent of the world’s oil,
hasn’t changed quotas since agreeing to its biggest-ever cuts in
production in December 2008. Brent crude oil futures for January
settlement were trading near $89 a barrel this morning on
London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
