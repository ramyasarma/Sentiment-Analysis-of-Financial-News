Nigerian workers at  Exxon Mobil
Corp. ’s local unit have begun an “indefinite strike” to
protest the firing of members and the high number of expatriate
employees, a union leader said.  “No work is going on at the company’s headquarters in
Lagos and its operational base in Eket,” Jude Nwaogu, chairman
of the company’s branch of the Pengassan union, said by phone 
today from the southeastern town of Eket. “If management allows
this strike to degenerate, we shall pull out our members from
the oil platforms and stop oil loading at the terminal.”  An official who answered the phone at Exxon Mobil’s
Nigerian office said no one was available to comment.  Exxon Mobil holds a 40 percent stake in a joint venture it
operates for state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. The
venture produces 720,000 barrels a day of crude, condensate and
natural gas liquids from 90 offshore platforms, according to its
 website . Nigeria is Africa’s biggest crude producer and the
fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  Expatriates hold 13 percent of management positions in
Exxon Mobil’s local unit, more than the 5 percent stipulated by
Nigerian law, the Pengassan union said.  A law signed by President Goodluck Jonathan in April
specifies oil and gas industry jobs and services that must be
reserved for Nigerians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
