Ghana ’s government is responsible for
a fifth of bad loans at the country’s banks because of arrears
owed to contractors, suppliers, and municipalities, said Joseph
Abbey, director of the  Centre for Policy Analysis .  “It is a big factor in the stock of non-performing loans in
the banking sector,” he said in an interview in Accra today.
Government arrears amount to 2 billion cedis ($1.38 billion),
Abbey said, citing research by the organization.  The government’s failure to repay its loans has led to road
projects being halted and has left schools and clinics
struggling to pay for supplies, Abbey said.  About 16 percent of loans by Ghana’s commercial banks were
classified as non-performing as of September, down from more
than 20 percent in February, he said. Ghana, which is set to
begin exporting oil this month, has a proposed 2011 budget of
12.7 billion cedis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
