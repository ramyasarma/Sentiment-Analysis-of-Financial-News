Gold rose for a fourth straight day
after the dollar weakened, boosting the appeal of the precious
metal and commodities as alternative investments.  The dollar fell for a second day against a basket of six
major currencies after a report showed pending home sales
unexpectedly advanced in October. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 commodities jumped as much as 1 percent. Gold is
headed for the 10th straight annual gain, touching a record
$1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9.  “Gold is up primarily on dollar weakness and economic
optimism,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
for Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “This is very positive for gold on
the future inflation front.”  Gold futures for February delivery rose $1, or 0.1 percent,
to settle at $1,389.30 an ounce at 2:05 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,399.70, the highest since
Nov. 12. The metal has gained 27 percent in 2010.  The index of pending home resales jumped a record 10
percent after dropping 1.8 percent in September, the National
Association of Realtors said today in Washington. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 1 percent
decrease. The group’s statistics go back to 2001.  Better Economic Data  “Gold is moving up on better economic data,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at Futurepath Trading in Chicago. “The risk
trade is on.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained as much as 1.3
percent, after rising 2.2 percent yesterday.  Gold’s gains were limited after some investors sold because
the price failed to breach $1,400.  “Gold is still being drawn to the $1,400 psychological
number,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products rose 7.65 tons to
2,094.48 tons yesterday, the highest amount since Oct. 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers.
Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on Oct. 14. Silver
investments gained 71.45 tons to 14,851.49 tons, data from four
providers show.  Silver futures for March delivery climbed 15.9 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $28.572 an ounce on the Comex. The metal has
gained 70 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery advanced $31.40, or
4.3 percent, to $763.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the metal increased as much as 5.7 percent to
$773.90, the highest price since April 2001.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose $29.10, or 1.7
percent, to $1,713.10 an ounce.  Platinum and palladium are used to make pollution-control
devices for cars. U.S. sales of light vehicles rose 17 percent
in November, Autodata Corp. said yesterday. The seasonally
adjusted annual-sales rate was 12.3 million, matching the
October rate that was the fastest since the U.S. government’s
“cash for clunkers” program in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
