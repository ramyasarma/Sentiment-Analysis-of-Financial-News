Ethiopia’s parliament approved a five-
year economic plan today that targets growth of as much as
14.9 percent by expanding agriculture and boosting savings to
fund investment.  The government will raise the minimum deposit rate, which
is currently below October inflation of 10.6 percent, Prime
Minister  Meles Zenawi  told lawmakers in the capital, Addis
Ababa. The average rate is 4 percent, Zemen Bank said in July.  The growth plan aims to expand the road network to 136,000
kilometers (90,720 miles) from 49,000, build a 2,000-kilometer
rail network and increase electricity coverage to 75 percent of
the population from 41 percent by quadrupling power production
to 8,000 megawatts. Agriculture will continue to dominate the
economy, Meles said.  It is a “basic fallacy” to believe that an agriculture-
led economy is a “backward system,” Meles said, citing New
Zealand as an example. Investment in the industry will enable
subsistence farmers to start selling to markets, and 3 million
hectares (7.4 million acres) of land leased for large-scale
farming, he said.  The changes will enable Ethiopia to feed its own population
and have a surplus for export, the former rebel said.  Increased savings and improved revenue collection, which
will see its share of national income rise to 17 percent from 10
percent, will help finance the growth plan, Meles said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
