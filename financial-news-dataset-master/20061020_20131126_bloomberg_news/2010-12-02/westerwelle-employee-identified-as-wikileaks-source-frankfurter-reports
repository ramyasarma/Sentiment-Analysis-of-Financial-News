An employee in Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle ’s parliamentary office was identified as a
source for information divulged to the U.S. Embassy and exposed
by WikiLeaks.org,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  The worker, identified as 42-year-old Helmut M., revealed
results of government coalition talks following Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  electoral victory last year that were later
detailed in diplomatic cables to Washington, the newspaper said,
without saying where it got the information. Helmut M. was moved
to other duties, it said.  An employee in Westerwelle’s parliamentary office referred
calls to the Free Democratic Party press office, which didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
