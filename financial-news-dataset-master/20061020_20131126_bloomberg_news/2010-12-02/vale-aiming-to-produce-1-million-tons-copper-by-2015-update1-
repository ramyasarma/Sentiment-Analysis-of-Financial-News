Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, is aiming to boost copper output more than fivefold by
2015 as it seeks to diversify sales and catch up with rivals
such as Codelco SA and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  The company wants to accelerate its copper projects to be
among the world’s top five or six producers,  Tito Martins , head
of Vale’s basic materials operations, said today at an event
near Salamanca, Chile. Vale is analyzing three or four projects
in Chile, Peru and Brazil’s Carajas region and may also explore
for copper in Indonesia and the Philippines, he said.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, plans to produce about 1
million metric tons annually within five years. Possible
acquisitions may push that target higher, Martins said. That
compares with the 198,000 tons the company produced last year
and a target of 691,000 tons by 2015 that the company announced
on Oct. 28.  Copper prices in London more than  doubled  in the past two
years, and reached a record $8,966 on Nov. 11 amid growing
Chinese demand and concerns about production shortages. World
consumption of copper exceeded supply by 363,000 tons in the
first eight months of 2010, almost eight times more than a year
earlier, the International Copper Study Group said Nov. 23.  Acquisitions  Vale also said today it completed its Tres Valles mine in
central Chile’s Coquimbo region, with initial capacity of 18,500
tons of copper cathodes a year. The world’s second-biggest miner
by market value spent $140 million on the project.  Making acquisitions will depend on Vale’s capacity to
discover new copper reserves at its current assets, Martins said
during a press conference after inaugurating Tres Valles.  “It would be something more targeted, looking to buy
reserves,” he said.  Tres Valles is  Vale’s first copper venture  in Chile, the
country that controls about 30 percent of the world’s total
reserves of the metal. The company’s current pipeline of copper
projects in Brazil will lead to production of 700,000 tons a
year once completed, Gilberto Schubert, Vale’s country manager
for Chile, said in a separate interview.  ‘Speed up Expansion’  “Vale has in its plans to speed up the expansion in these
new projects,”  Juliano Navarro , an analyst at Banco Espirito
Santo SA, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “It’s a
matter of diversification, to be in a lot of different countries
and regions even if it’s with small assets.”  Vale produced 131,000 tons of copper in the first nine
months of 2010, down 21 percent from 2009, the company said Oct.
18. Codelco produced 1.78 million tons in 2009 and Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. produced 1.61 million tons, according
to London-based metals-consulting company CRU.  Vale rose 27 centavos, or 0.6 percent, to 49.50 reais as of
6:08 p.m. in Sao Paulo trading today. The company has gained 17
percent since the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
