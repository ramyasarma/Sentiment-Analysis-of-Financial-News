Cie Automotive SA , a Spanish car-
parts maker, said it will sell a stake of its Brazilian unit in
an initial public offering during the “first part” of 2011 to
finance new  acquisitions  in South America’s biggest economy.  Cie , which has more than 60 manufacturing plants throughout
Europe, the Americas and Asia, is ready to sell shares of its
Brazil’s Autometal SA unit to keep growing in the region,
Chairman  Antonio Pradera  said in a phone interview.  “We have many possibilities of integrating companies in
our project,” Pradera said, referring to Brazil. “It’s always
been a project of growth. The growth potential in the Americas
is spectacular.”  Cie is betting on rapid growth in emerging markets to
offset a drop in demand in developed countries last year. This
year there will be a “record” for sales, based on the
company’s nine-month performance, Pradera said. Cie will double
its 2009 sales before the target date of 2013, he said.  Cie rose 2 percent to close at 4.08 euros in Madrid
trading. The  stock  has advanced 22 percent this year, valuing
the company at 465 million euros ($615 million).  Acquisition Strategy  To further expand in emerging economies, the Bilbao, Spain-
based company may buy businesses with sales of as much as 100
million reais ($58.6 million) in Brazil. Outside the Americas,
the company is looking at Russia, Turkey, India and China to
acquire smaller companies, Pradera said. More than 95 percent of
sales are outside Spain, according to the executive, who said
that demand in Europe won’t reach 2008 levels for at least three
to four years.  Cie, whose clients include  Volkswagen AG ,  General Motors
Co. ,  Ford Motor Co .,  Renault SA  and other carmakers and auto-
parts makers, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization will also reach a “record” this year. This
growth will reduce its debt-to-Ebitda ratio to close to 2.5
times at the end of the year and to about 2 times in 2011, from
4.6 times in 2009.  Founded in 1996, Cie may soon be able to pay a dividend
again, after suspending it last year, Pradera said, without
providing a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
