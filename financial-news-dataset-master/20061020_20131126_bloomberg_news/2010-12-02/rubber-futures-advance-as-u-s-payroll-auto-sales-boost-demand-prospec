Rubber climbed for a fourth day to a
one-week high as data showed bigger-than-forecast growth in U.S.
employment and higher vehicle sales, boosting optimism that
demand will grow for the commodity used in tires.  May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange added
as much as 2.7 percent to 373.3 yen per kilogram ($4,441 a
metric ton) before settling at 371.7 yen. The most-active
contract reached a 30-year high of 383 yen on Nov. 11.  A report from ADP Employer Services showed businesses added
93,000 workers to payrolls in November, more than the 70,000
expected by economists, based on the median of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  General Motors Co.  and  Ford Motor Co. 
reported improved sales last month as demand for pickups and
sport-utility vehicles helped the industry match its fastest
sales pace of the year.  “Data from the U.S. boosted investor confidence in
economic recovery, leading to purchases of industrial
commodities including rubber,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
Tokyo-based broker Fujitomi Co., said today by phone.  May-delivery rubber in Shanghai rose as much as 2.8 percent
to 32,045 yuan ($4,808) a ton. The price reached a record 38,920
yuan on Nov. 11.  Industrywide light-vehicle  sales  ran at a 12.3 million
annual pace in November, matching the October rate that was the
fastest since the U.S. government’s “cash for clunkers”
program in 2009. Annual U.S. sales plunged to 10.4 million last
year, the worst year since 1982, after averaging 16.8 million
from 2000 to 2007.  Cash-Price Increase  The  cash rubber price  in Thailand increased to 132.05 baht
($4.40) per kilogram today from 131.55 baht yesterday, the
 Rubber Research Institute of Thailand  said. The price climbed to
a record 132.75 baht on Nov. 23 as rain and flooding curbed
supply from the world’s largest producer and exporter as China-
led demand climbed.  Bridgestone Corp. , the world’s largest tiremaker, expects
to cut its rubber use by 50 percent in the next decade to cope
with rising raw material costs, Masayuki Ishii, general manager
at the corporate communications division said in an interview.  The company will use 1.77 million tons of natural and
synthetic rubber for tire production this year, up 24 percent
from 2009. Of the total, 1.23 million tons, or 69 percent, is
for output overseas, he said.  Natural-rubber demand in China will be 2.8 million tons
this year, while local output may be 680,000 tons, according to
Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., the nation’s largest tiremaker. It
gave the forecasts at an industry conference in Bangkok today.  Thai Hua Rubber Pcl., Thailand’s third-largest rubber
exporter, has signed deals to supply around 1.8 million tons to
Chinese tiremakers and rubber products companies.  The company and its affiliates, Thai Mac STR Co. and Hua
Tai Rubber Co., will supply latex, standard Thai rubber compound
and ribbed smoked sheet compound to eight Chinese companies
including Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., China’s largest tiremaker,
Luckchai Kittipol, chief executive officer of Thai Hua Rubber,
said on the sidelines of a seminar.  Supply from the  Association of Natural Rubber Producing
Countries , which accounts for about 92 percent of global output,
may drop 3.8 percent in the three months to Dec. 31 as rains
have disrupted tapping in Thailand, the group said on Nov. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
