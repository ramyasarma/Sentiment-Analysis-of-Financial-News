Canadian stocks  swung between gains
and losses as energy companies rose with natural gas prices
while banks declined on lower fourth-quarter profits by Toronto-
Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.  and Talisman Energy Inc.
led gains by energy stocks. Toronto-Dominion, the country’s
second-largest bank by assets, slid 2.4 percent after net income
dropped 1.6 percent. CIBC dropped 1 percent as profit fell 22
percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 6.36 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 13,1654.71 as of 9:59 a.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark for Canadian stocks rose yesterday to its  highest 
level since September 2008.  The S&P/TSX has gained for five-straight months, surging 15
percent from July through November. Raw-material companies led
the advance as commodity prices increased in part on demand from
emerging markets such as China, whose economy may grow 10
percent this year, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
