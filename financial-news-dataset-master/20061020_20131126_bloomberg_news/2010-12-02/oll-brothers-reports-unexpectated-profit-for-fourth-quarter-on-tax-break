Toll Brothers Inc. , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, reported an unexpected fourth-quarter
profit after a tax benefit and decline in writedowns.  Net income in the three months through October was $50.5
million, or 30 cents a share, compared with a loss of $111.4
million, or 68 cents, a year earlier, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts projected a
loss of 7 cents a share, the average of 17 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  The company had its second straight quarterly profit after
three years of losses as it recorded a $59.9 million benefit
from a tax-law change. U.S. homebuilders have struggled to
maintain profitability on an operating basis as foreclosures and
an  unemployment  rate near 10 percent stifle demand.  “The company remains, in our view, among the higher
quality homebuilders,”  Vincent Foley  and  Cedric Morris , credit
analysts with Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, said in a note
to investors today. “However, the quarter’s results did include
a bevy of favorable and unfavorable items.”  Revenue fell to $402.6 million from $486.6 million a year
earlier, Toll Brothers said. The loss from operations, which
excludes the tax gain, narrowed to $37.9 million from $105
million a year earlier.  Contracts Decline  Toll Brothers signed contracts for 558 homes worth $315.3
million in the quarter, down 27 percent in units and dollars
from a year earlier. Average sales per community fell 17 percent
to 2.94 units. Since 1990, the company averaged sales of six
units per community during the quarter.  Sales and orders were a “bit below” the estimates of
 Stephen East , a New York-based analyst with Ticonderoga
Securities LLC, who had anticipated weak demand following the
expiration of a tax credit that stimulated home buying earlier
this year.  “We expected very little from this post-tax credit quarter
and we got it,” East wrote.  Toll Brothers completed sales of 700  homes  for an average
net price of about $565,000, compared with 860 properties at
about $563,000 a year earlier, the company said.  It expects to sell between 2,100 and 2,900 homes in fiscal
2011 at an average price of $540,000 to $565,000. The company
sold 2,642 units in the recently ended year, down 11 percent
from fiscal 2009.  Buying Land  Toll Brothers probably will add 20 to 30  selling
communities  next year after ending fiscal 2010 with 195, Chief
Executive Officer  Douglas Yearley Jr.  said in the statement. The
company added 3,000 lots during the year, the first annual
increase since 2005, to bring its total to 34,900.  The company’s available land, access to capital and focus
on luxury homes will benefit it “when the market recovers,”
Chairman  Robert Toll  said. “The key word is ‘when.’ ”  Purchases of new U.S. homes unexpectedly dropped 8.1
percent to an annual rate of 283,000 in October, the Commerce
Department reported Nov. 24.  Sales  reached a 275,000 pace in
August, the lowest on records dating to 1963, after tax credits
for buyers expired.  Even if sales rebound, Toll Brothers may be hurt by weaker
demand for larger homes since the recession,  Vicki Bryan , an
analyst at Gimme Credit LLC in New York, wrote in a note to
investors yesterday.  Smaller Homes  “A rebound in demand, when it does occur, will likely
prove less profitable as most of the homes that sell could be
much smaller versus the ‘McMansions’ that dominated the market
before the crash,” she wrote.  Toll Brothers’ results included $27 million of inventory
writedowns, compared with $85.5 million a year earlier. The tax
credit, stemming from a U.S. law allowing builders to carry back
losses from land sales for five years, helped Toll post its
second straight quarterly profit, after 11 consecutive losses.  The company’s shares slipped 29 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$18.17 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Toll Brothers dropped 1.9 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with an 8.6 percent decline for the 12-
member Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Homebuilding  Index .  -- Editors:  Kara Wetzel ,  Larry Edelman   To contact the reporter on this story:
