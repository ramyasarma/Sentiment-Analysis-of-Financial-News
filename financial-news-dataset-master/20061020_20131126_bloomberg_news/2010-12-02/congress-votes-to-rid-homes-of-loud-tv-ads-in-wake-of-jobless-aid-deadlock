The U.S. Congress, deadlocked on
extending aid to the long-term jobless, agreed to help rid homes
of loud television commercials.  The House today passed the Commercial Advertisement
Loudness Mitigation Act, which would direct regulators to set
limits on the volume of TV ads.  “I think that we will have more peace in homes across the
country,” Representative  Anna Eshoo , a California Democrat,
said during debate Nov. 30.  The legislation directs the Federal Communications
Commission to adopt standards set by TV broadcasters that would
keep commercials from being louder than surrounding programming.
It passed the Senate in September and needs President Barack
Obama’s signature before becoming law.  “Consumers will no longer have to experience being blasted
at,” Eshoo said. “It’s a simple fix to a huge nuisance.”  Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse , a Rhode Island Democrat, said
in a statement, “Americans experience the frustration of
abrasively loud television commercials.”  “While this is far from the biggest issue we face, it will
mean one less daily annoyance in our lives,” he said.  The broadcast industry has been working on the volume issue
for several years, Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the
Washington-based National Association of Broadcasters, said in
an e-mailed statement.  “We’re pleased that the fruits of our efforts will become
apparent to TV viewers over time,” Wharton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
