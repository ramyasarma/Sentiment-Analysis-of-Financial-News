Deutsche Post AG  should lose its bid
to block 297.5 million euros ($391 million) in state aid to
Belgium’s La Poste SA, an adviser to the European Union’s top
court said.  A ruling in favor of Deutsche Post last year “should be
canceled” and the challenge “be declared inadmissible,”
Advocate General  Niilo Jaeaeskinen  of the  EU’s Court of Justice 
said in a non-binding opinion today. The Luxembourg-based court
follows such advice in a majority of cases.  Belgium appealed after Deutsche Post, the world’s biggest
transporter of air and sea freight by volume, won a lower-court
ruling to annul EU backing for the aid. The February 2009 ruling
triggered an in-depth review by the European Commission, the 27
nation EU’s antitrust regulator, into all state aid received by
Belgium’s state-controlled postal service.  The case is one of the hurdles La Poste has to clear before
it can proceed with a planned initial public offering. CVC
Capital Partners Ltd., which owns almost 50 percent of La Poste,
in June hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. to
advise on a possible stock sale.  Deutsche Post  sued  the commission in November 2003 after
the regulator approved the capital injection by the Belgian
government. A ruling by the court usually follows within six
months after an opinion.  Deutsche Post must study the reasoning of the advocate
general before it can comment,  Uwe Bensien , a spokesman for the
company, said by telephone.  The case is C-148/09 P, Belgium v Deutsche Post and Others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
