The Slovak economy advanced at a
faster pace in the third quarter than previously estimated as
export demand from Germany outweighed a slump in domestic
consumption, hurt by job losses.  Gross domestic product  grew  an annual 3.8 percent, rather
than the 3.7 percent estimated on Nov. 12, the Slovak
Statistical Office in Bratislava said today. Annual economic
growth slowed from a revised 4.2 percent in the second quarter.
GDP rose 1 percent from the April-June period, the office said.  Slovakia, which adopted the euro in 2009, is relying on a
revival in foreign demand for its products, including cars
assembled by Volkswagen AG, to fuel growth. Household spending
is sapped by persistent  unemployment  as the number of people
with jobs declined an annual 1.3 percent in the third quarter.  “The result is still very solid,”  Eduard Hagara , an
economist at ING Groep NV in Bratislava, said in an e-mailed
note. “Growth is still driven mainly by foreign demand, namely
from Germany. Consumer demand remains weak because of high
unemployment, which will decline very gradually as Slovaks will
probably be very cautious with opening up their purses.”  Exports rose an annual 14.8 percent, compared with 16.1
percent in the previous quarter. Household consumption fell an
annual 0.3 percent, while investment and inventories were up
17.9 percent from the third quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
