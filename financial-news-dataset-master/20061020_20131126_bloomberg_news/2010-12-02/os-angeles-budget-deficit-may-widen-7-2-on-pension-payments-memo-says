Los Angeles’s budget deficit may grow
by 7.2 percent to $343 million for the fiscal year that begins
July 1, according to a memo from City Administrative Officer
 Miguel Santana .  The gap would widen from $320 million projected earlier if
the board of the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pensions Plan votes
tomorrow to increase city contribution rates, based on the
latest actuarial valuation, according to the administrator’s
memo released today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
