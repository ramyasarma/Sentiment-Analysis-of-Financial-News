Lamido Sanusi , governor of the
Central Bank of Nigeria, offered to resign if parliament wants
him to go, after he accused lawmakers of soaking up much of the
federal budget,  BusinessDay  reported.  Sanusi made the statement yesterday at a parliamentary
hearing into comments he made at the weekend, when he said 25
percent of the government’s recurrent expenditure goes to the
legislature alone, the Lagos-based newspaper said.  Pressed to apologize by lawmakers, the governor refused,
the newspaper said. Citing figures from the budget office,
Sanusi said the government’s recurring expenditure was 536.3
billion naira ($3.6 billion), of which 136.3 billion naira went
to the parliament, according to the newspaper. Lawmakers
disputed the figures.  Nigeria will post a budget deficit this year equivalent to
6.1 percent of gross domestic product after revenue missed
forecasts, Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga  said on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
