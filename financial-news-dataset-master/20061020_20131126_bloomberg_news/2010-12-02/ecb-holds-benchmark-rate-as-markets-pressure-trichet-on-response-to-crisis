The European Central Bank kept
interest rates at a record low as investors look to President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  for an announcement on how the bank will
fight the worsening sovereign debt crisis.  ECB officials in Frankfurt set the  benchmark lending rate 
at 1 percent for a 20th month, as predicted by all 52 economists
in a  Bloomberg News survey . Attention is now on Trichet’s 2:30
p.m. press conference and whether he will take more action to
stop the spread of the crisis, such as extending the ECB’s
provision of unlimited liquidity for banks and significantly
ramping up its bond purchases, both of which were supposed to be
temporary measures.  “I still don’t believe in massive bond buys, possibly
that’s more wishful thinking by markets,” said  Carsten Brzeski ,
an economist at ING Groep NV in Brussels and a former European
Commission official. “The U-turn would be extreme and it’s not
the task of the ECB to solve countries’ solvency problems.”  Trichet has been forced into an about-face before. On May
6, as Greece’s budget crisis was fueling investor concerns about
the fiscal health of other euro-area nations, he resisted
pressure to employ new measures, saying it was up to governments
to lead the way. That lack of action triggered a bond-market
selloff, forcing the ECB to start buying government debt just
four days later and provoking a split on its Governing Council.  ‘Carry The Show’  Trichet finds himself in a similar position today.
Investors have been dumping  Irish ,  Greek ,  Portuguese , Spanish
and Belgian assets after the European Union-led rescue package
for Ireland failed to convince them that policy makers have the
tools required, or the resolve needed, to contain the crisis.  “The ECB really wants to focus on its core business but
it’s not being allowed to,” said  Nick Kounis , chief euro-region
economist at ABN Amro NV in Amsterdam. “The politicians need to
get their act together but until they do, the ECB is left trying
to carry the show with these sort of facilities, which are no
solution to the problem.”  Bonds, stocks and the euro today extended yesterday’s rally
as markets interpreted a comment from Trichet as a signal policy
makers may step up their response. Trichet told the European
Parliament late on Nov. 30 that some investors are
underestimating governments’ determination to defend financial
stability in the currency bloc.  Bond Purchases  The euro rebounded above $1.31 and  Spanish  10-year
government bonds snapped an 11-day drop, sending the yield down
to 5.20 percent today from 5.50 percent on Nov. 30. That’s still
239 basis points more than the yield on comparable German bunds.  It would be “more than reasonable” for the ECB to buy
Spanish government bonds, Efe newswire quoted Spanish Industry
Minister  Miguel Sebastian  as saying yesterday. He said
purchasing debt was “within the orthodoxy” of central banks
and the Bank of England and Federal Reserve are following such a
policy, Efe reported from Moscow.  Increasing its bond purchases, or resorting to outright
quantitative easing by failing to sterilize them, would see the
ECB take more risk onto its balance sheet and open itself to the
charge it’s financing profligate nations.  Such steps may be resisted by a group on the ECB’s 22-
member council led by Bundesbank President  Axel Weber , a leading
contender to replace Trichet at the bank’s helm next year.  Weber’s Opposition  Weber opposed the bond program when it was announced on May
10 and has since called for it to be cancelled, saying it
involves “stability risks” and there is no evidence it is
working.  “The risk associated with bond purchases is that the
credit risk does not disappear,” said  Holger Sandte , chief
European economist at WestLB Equity Markets in Dusseldorf. “If
the worst comes to the worst, the ECB has all these risks on its
balance sheet. It’s really a job for politicians to rescue
sovereigns.”  Weber and policy makers such as ECB Executive Board member
 Juergen Stark  are also pushing for the bank to resume its
withdrawal of cheap loans to banks as the economy improves. The
phasing out of the liquidity measures “will continue” after
the end of the year, Stark said on Nov. 16.  The ECB publishes its latest projections today. They may
show the euro area’s recovery continuing next year as Germany,
the region’s largest economy, prospers from export demand and
rising household spending.  Next Exit Step  The ECB currently offers banks as much cash as they need at
its benchmark rate for periods of one week, one month and three
months. Last month, Trichet said the ECB will announce further
steps in its exit from unconventional measures in December due
to concerns that banks are becoming “addicted” to the abundant
liquidity.  The next likely step in the exit would be announcing a
return to an auction procedure for the three-month loans, said
 Klaus Baader , co-chief euro-area economist at Societe Generale
in London. That could limit the amount banks are able to borrow
and result in a higher interest rate.  “The ECB is dead set on unwinding measures” so a
discontinuation of the full allotment in its three-month
refinancing operations “is still likely, although a close
call,” said Baader. “They could give a clear date so the
decision is taken, but not implemented immediately. That’s a
compromise that would be beneficial to all.”  ‘Add to Alarm’  Even a move in that direction risks further unnerving
investors and exacerbating market tensions, said  Ken Wattret ,
chief euro-area economist at BNP Paribas in London. “If the ECB
really goes ahead with the exit or even just signals it will
proceed with the exit, it will add to alarm.”  Morgan Stanley economists  Joachim Fels  and  Elga Bartsch 
said in a research note that there’s a “good chance” the ECB
will reverse its exit and reintroduce unlimited 12-month loans
to banks.  Saying it will buy more government debt would also calm
markets, said  Holger Schmieding , chief economist at Joh
Berenberg Gossler & Co. in London.  The ECB has already stepped up its activity, last week
buying the most bonds in two months. Yesterday it bought Irish
government bonds in bigger amounts than it typically does,
according to two people with knowledge of the transactions.  Overall purchases  so far total 67 billion euros ($88
billion), well below the amounts bought by the Bank of England
and the Fed.  “To avoid the risk of a market panic the ECB can do more
and should buy more government bonds,” said Schmieding. “If
the patient is in danger of a heart attack, a medicine with side
effects is justified.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
