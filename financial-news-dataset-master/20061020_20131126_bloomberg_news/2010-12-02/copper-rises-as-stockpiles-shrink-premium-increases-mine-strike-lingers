Copper prices rose to the highest in
almost three weeks after an index of pending U.S. home resales
jumped a record 10 percent in October.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a
1 percent decrease in the gauge from the National Association of
Realtors. Copper  inventories  monitored by the London Metal
Exchange extended a slide to the lowest in almost 14 months, and
a strike at a Chilean mine is completing the fourth week. The
price has rallied 38 percent since July 1.  “Supply is going to be the main focus of the market,”
said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
broker in Chicago. “Copper will really start to cook again”
should the economic recovery prove to be sustainable, he said.  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 3.15 cents, or
0.8 percent, to close at $3.979 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the fourth straight gain. Earlier, the price
reached $3.997, the highest for a most-active contract since
Nov. 12.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months climbed
$135, or 1.6 percent, to $8,720 a metric ton ($3.96 a pound).
The metal reached a record $8,966 on Nov. 11. On that date, the
Comex price reached a 30-month high of $4.0875.  In London, zinc jumped 4.6 percent, the most in four
months. Lead gained 4.6 percent, and tin advanced 3 percent, the
most in six weeks. Aluminum and nickel also rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
