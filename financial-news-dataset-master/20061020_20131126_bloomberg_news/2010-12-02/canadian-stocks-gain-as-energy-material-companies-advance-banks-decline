Canadian stocks  gained for a fourth
day as commodity producers rallied after the European Central
Bank delayed its withdrawal of stimulus measures, offsetting
declines by banks on lower profits.  Talisman Energy Inc. jumped 1.5 percent after it got a
revolving line of credit and oil prices advanced. Teck Resources
Ltd. rose 1.7 percent as prices of gold, copper and silver
advanced. Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s second-largest
bank by assets, slid 2.4 percent after reporting fourth-quarter
net income dropped 1.6 percent. Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce dropped 1.3 percent as profit fell 22 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 28.54
points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,176.89 as of 10:41 a.m. in
Toronto. The benchmark for Canadian stocks rose yesterday to its
 highest  level since September 2008.  “The European Central Bank has been supporting the
markets,” said  Blair Falconer , who oversees about C$900 million
($895 million) as a money manager at HSBC Securities (Canada)
Inc. in Toronto. “The financial sector is not performing well
today, but we’ve really had some strong commodity moves
overnight and that’s supporting the Canadian dollar and
therefore the stock market.”  The S&P/TSX has gained for five-straight months, surging 15
percent from July through November. Raw-material companies led
the advance as commodity prices increased in part on demand from
emerging markets such as China, whose economy may grow 10
percent this year, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  Unlimited Loans  Stocks and commodities advanced after President  Jean-Claude Trichet  told reporters at a press conference in Frankfurt the
ECB will offer banks unlimited loans through the first quarter
over periods of seven days, one month and three months.  Canada’s currency climbed for the second day, rising 1
percent to C$1.0066 per U.S. dollar, while crude oil futures for
January delivery increased 43 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $87.18 a
barrel. Oil earlier fell as low as $86.27 a barrel.  Talisman Energy jumped 1.5 percent to C$20.14. The Calgary-
based oil and gas company got a C$3.85 billion ($3.78 billion)
revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes,
according to a person familiar with the deal.  Teck Resources rose 1.7 percent to C$53.36 as material
stocks gained 0.4 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp. , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, jumped 0.6 percent to C$53.60.  Toronto-Dominion declined 2.4 percent to C$73.48. CIBC fell
1.3 percent to C$80. Both lenders reported lower fourth-quarter
profits as trading income declined.  Toronto-Dominion said net income for the period ended Oct.
31 dropped 1.6 percent to C$994 million ($908 million), or
C$1.07 a share. CIBC’s profit fell 22 percent to C$500 million,
or C$1.17 a share. Before one-time items, Toronto-Dominion
missed analyst estimates, while CIBC topped expectations.  Bombardier Inc. declined 3.4 percent to C$4.61. The world’s
third-biggest civil-aircraft manufacturer posted  third-quarter
earnings  excluding some items of 8 cents a share, missing the
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey by a penny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
