Kim Clijsters  was voted women’s
tennis Player of the Year for a second time, three months after
she claimed the U.S. Open title for a third time.  The 27-year-old Belgian won the honor after successfully
defending the U.S. Open title she won in 2009 a month after
ending a 28-month retirement. Clijsters also claimed titles in
Brisbane, Miami, Cincinnati and Doha this year.  “Its really nice to win the Player of the Year award just
one year after making a comeback and while I didn’t think it
would come so quickly, I am thrilled with the news,” Clijsters
said in a statement.  Clijsters was also named player of the year in 2005, when
she won her first U.S. Open title.  Gisela Dulko  and  Flavia Pennetta , the world’s No. 1 ranked
team, were  named Doubles Team of the Year.  Petra Kvitova  is the
Newcomer of the Year after reaching her first Grand Slam
semifinal at Wimbledon. Comeback Player of the Year is  Justine Henin , who came out of retirement in January and reached the
finals in Brisbane and the Australian Open.  The global tennis media determines the recipients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
