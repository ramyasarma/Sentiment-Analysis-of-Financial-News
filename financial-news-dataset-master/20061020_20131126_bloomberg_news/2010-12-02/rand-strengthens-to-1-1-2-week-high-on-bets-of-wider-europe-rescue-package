The rand gained to a 1 1/2-week high
against the dollar after the European Central Bank said it will
maintain emergency liquidity for banks and continue buying
government bonds to prevent its debt crisis from spreading.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 0.8 percent
to 6.9538 per dollar, the strongest since Nov. 22, and traded at
6.9539 by 5:10 p.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of
7.0071. Against the euro, the rand added 0.1 percent to 9.1889
for a fourth day of gains.  The Frankfurt-based ECB will offer banks unlimited loans
through the first quarter over periods of seven days, one month
and three months, President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said in
Germany’s financial hub today. The decision marks a shift from
his stance last month, when he said ECB could start limiting
access to its funds in the first quarter.  “It should be a positive for the rand,”  Leon Myburgh , a
fixed-income and currency strategist for sub-Saharan Africa at
Citigroup Inc., said by telephone from Johannesburg. “Any
measures to address the euro zone’s problems would be good for
risk appetite, which should benefit South Africa as we still
offer one of the highest yields around.”  The South African central bank’s 5.5 percent benchmark rate
compares with 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in Japan.  The ECB met today under pressure from investors to stop the
debt crisis from engulfing  Spain , the euro area’s fourth-largest
economy, after an Irish bailout four days ago failed to persuade
markets that policy makers can resolve the problem. The rand
slid to a 2 1/2-month low of 7.1789 on Nov. 29 on concern
Ireland’s 85 billion-euro ($112 billion) rescue would fail to
prevent Europe’s debt crisis from spreading.  Government bonds fell in South Africa for the first time in
three days, with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due
September 2015 losing 16 cents to 124.16 rand. The yield on the
bond climbed 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.40
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
