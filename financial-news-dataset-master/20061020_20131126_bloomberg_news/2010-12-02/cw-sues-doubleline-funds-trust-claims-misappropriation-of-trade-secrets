A trust created by DoubleLine Capital
LP’s  Jeffrey Gundlach  was sued by TCW Group Inc., which
already sued its former investment chief after he brought more
than half of its fixed-income professionals to his new firm.  DoubleLine Funds Trust was started to market DoubleLine
Capital’s mutual funds and to “generate fees and profit for
Gundlach and the money management firm he had formed,” TCW said
in a new complaint filed yesterday in state court in Los
Angeles. TCW provided a copy of the complaint to Bloomberg News.  TCW, a Los Angeles-based money management firm, accuses the
trust and its trustees of misappropriation of trade secrets and
unfair competition, among other allegations, and seeks
unspecified damages.  “Jeffrey Gundlach and his co-conspirators built a business
based on the wholesale theft of huge amounts of TCW’s
proprietary data and analytical systems, and that business
includes DoubleLine Funds Trust,” Steve Madison, a lawyer for
TCW, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “When DoubleLine
Funds was launched last spring, TCW notified the funds and their
trustees of TCW’s intent to name the trust as a defendant.”  TCW, a unit of  Societe Generale , in January accused
Gundlach and several former employees who joined DoubleLine of
breach of fiduciary duty, unfair competition and
misappropriation of confidential information and demanded more
than $200 million in damages.  “TCW has made false claims against DoubleLine for 11
months,” Lew Phelps, a spokesman for DoubleLine, said today.
“Their case is going not at all well. This latest legal action
by TCW is redundant and meaningless.”  The case is Trust Company of the West v. DoubleLine Funds
Trust, BC450413, Los Angeles County Superior Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
