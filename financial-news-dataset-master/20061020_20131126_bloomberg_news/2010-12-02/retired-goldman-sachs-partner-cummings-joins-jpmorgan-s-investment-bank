JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, hired retired  Goldman Sachs  Group
Inc. partner  Robert Cummings  Jr. as a vice chairman in the
firm’s investment bank.  Cummings, who most recently worked at GSC Capital Group as
a senior managing director, spent 27 years at Goldman Sachs
advising clients on strategic financing and mergers and
acquisitions, New York-based JPMorgan said today in a statement.
He will take on a similar role at JPMorgan, reporting to  Jeffrey Urwin  and  Kevin Willsey , who co-run investment banking in the
Americas.  “Bob brings to the firm a vast array of deep relationships
from working with large multinational companies across various
industries over the past three decades,” Willsey said in the
statement.  JPMorgan’s investment bank was the top equity underwriter
in 2009 and the first three quarters of this year among U.S.
banks.  Cummings joined GSC in 2002 and sits on the boards of
 Corning Inc . and  Viasystems Group Inc ., according to the
statement.  Cummings, who has a master’s degree in business
administration from the University of Chicago, studied art
history at Columbia University after retiring from Goldman Sachs
in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
