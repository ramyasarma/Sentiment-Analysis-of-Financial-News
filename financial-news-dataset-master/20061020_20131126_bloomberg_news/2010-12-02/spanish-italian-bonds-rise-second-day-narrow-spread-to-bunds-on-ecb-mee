Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
rose for a second day, outperforming German bunds, amid
speculation that European Central Bank policy makers may take
steps to calm Europe’s debt crisis at a meeting today.  The ECB “probably will be forced” to step up programs to
fight the crisis, said  Juergen Michels , chief euro-region
economist at Citigroup Inc. Policy makers kept their key rate
unchanged at 1 percent, a decision that was predicted by all 52
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  will explain the outcome at a press conference at 2:30
p.m. in Frankfurt. Spain drew stronger demand at a sale of
three-year notes today, with France also selling bonds.  “There is some speculation that the ECB may announce
additional measures to stem the pressures in the bond market,”
said  Elwin de Groot , a senior market economist at Rabobank Groep
in Utrecht, Netherlands. “That’s driving the market.”  The Spanish 10-year bond yield slid 15 basis points to 5.19
percent as of 12:53 p.m. in London. The 4.85 percent security
maturing in October 2020 rose 1.14, or 11.40 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,317) face amount, to 97.41. The extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt instead of similar-maturity German bonds
narrowed 19 basis points to 232 basis points.  German bund yields touched the highest since May 18 as
stocks advanced, damping demand for the safest fixed-income
assets. The yield rose as much as seven basis points to 2.85
percent, and was last at 2.82 percent. Italian 10-year yields
declined eight basis points to 4.46 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  of shares jumped 0.6 percent,
extending a 2 percent gain yesterday, and the euro strengthened
0.2 percent to $1.3169.  Spanish Sale  Bonds issued by high-deficit euro-area nations jumped
yesterday after Trichet signaled the previous day that investors
were underestimating policy makers’ determination to stabilize
the region. The debt slumped through November, with Spanish 10-
year securities rising on just two days that month, amid concern
the European crisis would force more nations to accept bailouts.  Spanish three-year yields plunged 21 basis points to 3.85
percent after the nation drew stronger demand for three-year
notes than at a previous auction in October. Spain raised 2.5
billion euros at the sale at an average yield of 3.717 percent,
from 2.527 percent in October. Investors bid for 2.27 times the
volume sold, from 2.16 in October.  “The decent amount executed at a very confident price
premium paints a picture of good quantity and quality of
demand,”  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole SA in London, said today by e-mail.  Trade Recommendation  France sold 5.395 billion euros of securities maturing in
2017, 2018 and 2025.  “I don’t believe that financial stability in the euro zone
could really be called into question,” Trichet told lawmakers
in Brussels two days ago. Observers “are tending to
underestimate the determination of governments.”  Investors should reduce their bets that bonds from Ireland,
Portugal, Greece and Spain will fall in the near term as risks
that policy makers will intervene have increased, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “The ECB could provide a temporary fix through increased
bond purchases,” JPMorgan strategists including New York-based
 Jan Loeys  wrote in a research note received today. “Without a
large-scale official intervention, intra-EMU spreads will keep
on widening. Stay short on peripherals, but keep positions
light.”  Exports from the 16-member euro region rose 1.9 percent in
the third quarter from the previous period, when they increased
4.3 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Investment stalled after rising 1.7
percent in the second quarter, while spending growth by
consumers accelerated to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent. Gross-
domestic-product growth eased to 0.4 percent from 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
