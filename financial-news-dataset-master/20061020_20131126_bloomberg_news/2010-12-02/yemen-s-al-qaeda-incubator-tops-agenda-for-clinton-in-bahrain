John Brennan , President  Barack Obama ’s top counterterrorism adviser, said today U.S. security
authorities are “particularly vigilant” during the holiday
travel season.  “We always have to stay on guard,” Brennan said during a
talk at the Washington-based  Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace . “If anything, we step it up” during
holidays.  “At this point, I am feeling good we have the appropriate
resources in place,” Brennan said.  Christmas marks the anniversary of the failed attempt by
 Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab  to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight
from Amsterdam to Detroit last Dec. 25. The Yemeni branch of al-
Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing.  Iraqi authorities have provided information obtained from
captured insurgents about an al-Qaeda plot planned against the
U.S. during the holiday season, a U.S. official said Dec. 15.
The official said the insurgents didn’t provide any other
details about the timing or the nature of any planned attack on
the U.S.  The risk of a terrorist attack from Yemen was further
underscored in October when two parcel bombs sent from that
country to U.S. synagogues were seized in the U.K. and Dubai.
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  has pledged to strengthen the
Yemeni military and accelerate development of the poorest Arab
economy, which is battling separatist groups as well as al-
Qaeda.  The bombing attempts in October, using devices concealed in
printer cartridges, prompted the U.S. and European countries to
bar flights or cargo from Yemen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
