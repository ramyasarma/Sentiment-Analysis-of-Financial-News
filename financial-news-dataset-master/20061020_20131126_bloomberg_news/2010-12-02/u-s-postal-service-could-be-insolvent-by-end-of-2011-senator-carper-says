The U.S. Postal Service, which had a
loss of $8.5 billion last year, may run out of money to keep
operating by next year’s winter holiday season, said one of the
top U.S. senators overseeing the agency.  “During next year’s holiday shopping and mailing season,
the Postal Service may not have the resources necessary to open
its doors,” Senator  Tom Carper , a Delaware Democrat, said today
in Washington at a Senate governmental affairs committee hearing
about the Postal Service. Carper is sponsoring legislation
intended to help the Postal Service earn more money.  The agency, which supports Carper’s bill, has said it may
lose a cumulative $238 billion by 2020 if Congress doesn’t act.
The measure would make it easier for the Postal Service to close
post offices and cut a day of delivery. It would also require
the agency’s financial condition to be considered when
negotiations with labor unions reach arbitration.  Congress, led by Democratic House members, has thwarted the
Postal Service’s request to eliminate Saturday delivery, and the
agency’s regulator denied its request this year to raise postage
rates by an average 5.6 percent, more than allowed by law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
