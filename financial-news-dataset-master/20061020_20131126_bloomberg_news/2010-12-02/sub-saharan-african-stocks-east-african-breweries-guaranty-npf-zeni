Kenya’s  All-Share Index  fell for a

dropping 0.9 percent to close at 78.78 by 3 p.m. in Nairobi.  Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  increased for a third day, adding
0.4 percent to close at 1,924.01 by 1:30 p.m. in Port Louis, the
highest since March 2008.  The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index  added 0.3
percent to 24,942.38 by the 12:30 p.m. close in Lagos, according
to data e-mailed by the bourse. The exchange postponed the start
of extended trading hours to Dec. 6 from Dec. 1, spokesman  Wole Tokede  said by phone today, without providing reasons.  The  Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share Index  slumped 1.3
percent to close at 6,996.57 by the 1 p.m. close in Accra. It
was the worst-performing gauge among more than 90 tracked by
Bloomberg.  Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index  was little changed at
from yesterday’s close at 823.15 by 5 p.m. in Windhoek.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  East African Breweries Ltd.  (EABL KN), 43 percent owned by
Diageo Plc, slumped 4 shillings, or 1.9 percent, to 208
shillings, the lowest in a month and paring its increase this
year to 43 percent. The stock was the biggest contributor to the
Kenyan index’s drop today. “The decline is because retail
investors are taking profit,” Renaldo D’souza, an analyst at
Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a telephone
interview today. The stock reached the highest since May 1997 on
Nov. 19.  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc  (GUARANTY NL), Nigeria’s third-
largest lender by market value, rose to a three-week high,
adding 45 kobo, or 2.8 percent to 16.45 naira. The bank led
gains in the nation’s stock index after Asset Management Corp.
of Nigeria, a state-owned company set up to buy bad debts from
the country’s lenders, said it plans to sell 2.5 trillion naira
($16.6 billion) of three-year, zero-coupon bonds to finance
those purchases, according to Chief Executive Officer Mustafa
Chike-Obi, who spoke in an interview in Lagos after the market
closed yesterday.  Zenith Bank Plc  (ZENITHBA NL), the biggest, rose for a
second day, climbing 13 kobo, or 0.9 percent, to 15.14
shillings.  NPF Microfinance Bank Plc  (NPFMCRFB NL), a Nigerian
financial company, added 6 kobo, or 4 percent, to 1.56 naira.

a dividend of 4.75 shillings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
