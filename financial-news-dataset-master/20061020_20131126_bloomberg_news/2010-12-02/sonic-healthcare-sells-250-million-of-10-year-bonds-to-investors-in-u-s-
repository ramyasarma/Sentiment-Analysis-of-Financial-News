Sonic Healthcare Ltd. , the largest
provider of medical tests in Australia, sold $250 million of 10-
year bonds to private investors in the U.S.  The 5.1 percent notes were priced to yield 215 basis points
more than Treasuries, the Sydney-based company said in a
statement released to the Australian stock exchange. Proceeds
will be used to repay  bank loans  and fund growth, it said.  Sonic has spent more than $1.8 billion on  acquisitions  in
the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company last month agreed to buy  CBLPath Inc.  for $123.5
million, saying the deal will boost sales and cut costs.  Sonic sold $250 million of seven- and 10-year bonds to U.S.
private investors in November 2009, pricing the notes at a 225
basis-point spread, according to a regulatory filing at the
time. The company has A$482 million ($471 million) of loan
facilities  maturing  next year, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
