Shoprite Holdings Ltd. Chairman
Christo Wiese, who was intercepted by U.K. customs officials
carrying 675,000 pounds in cash in his luggage, may appeal a
City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court ruling that he forfeit
the money, Moneyweb said, citing Wiese.  No criminal charges have been brought against him, the
Johannesburg-based news service said on its website, citing
Wiese. The City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court was satisfied
the cash was associated with criminality and made an order it be
forfeited, Moneyweb said, citing a statement from the U.K.
Border Agency.      To contact the editor responsible for this story:
