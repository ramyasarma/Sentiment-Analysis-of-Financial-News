The United Nations imposed sanctions
on a  Democratic Republic of Congo  army commander for multiple
human-rights abuses, including the use of child soldiers, the UN
missions of the U.S., U.K. and France said in a joint statement.  A UN Security Council sanctions committee banned
Lieutenant-Colonel Innocent Zimurinda from foreign travel and
froze his assets after reports by the UN and other aid groups
accused him of ordering massacres and rape, and recruiting child
soldiers, according to the e-mailed statement.  Zimurinda was integrated into the Congolese army last year
after his former rebel group, the National Congress for the
Defense of the People, or CNDP, signed a peace agreement with
the government. Zimurinda didn’t answer questions put to him
when called today on his mobile phone and didn’t respond to a
text-message request for comment.  Three Rwandan nationals were also sanctioned for commanding
the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a renegade
group based in eastern Congo with links to the perpetrators of
the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the statement said.  Congo’s eastern region has been mired in conflict for more
than 15 years, fuelled by illicit trade of natural resources.
Between 1998 and 2007, more than 3 million people died as a
result of the conflict, mainly due to preventable disease and
malnutrition, according to the  International Rescue Committee ,
the New York-based aid group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
