A platoon of foul-mouthed Scots is
blasting its way back onto the London stage.  “ Black Watch ” tracks the Scottish regiment’s deployment
in Iraq. As they endure the banality of war, bored boys put up
nude posters, pine for cheese on toast, and get caught with
their pants down by their commander.  Don’t miss the clever stage gimmickry: a pool table
doubling as a tank, a soldier narrating the regiment’s history
while peers change him into and out of corresponding costumes.  “Black Watch” is at the Barbican Theatre, the Friday
performance is at 7:45 p.m. Information:

Baracca is an old-style neighborhood Italian eatery at 2c Cherry
Walk, on Whitecross Street. Tel. +44-20-7588-0710.  Saturday  An undressed man neatly cuts open his torso, then hacks off
his toes with a chainsaw.  Sound like a gory movie? It’s a line-drawn animation piece
by Kristian de la Riva, part of this year’s young-artist survey
New Contemporaries, which in the past revealed  Damien Hirst .  Elsewhere, artist Greta Alfaro films vultures swooping in
on a lavish outdoor banquet table. The hungry birds knock down
chairs and smash plates as they fight over the roast. A metaphor
for our gluttonous times?  “New Contemporaries 2010” is at the Institute of
Contemporary Arts, the Mall, SW1, and sponsored by Bloomberg LP,
parent company of Bloomberg News. Information:

Saturday, with  Kylie Minogue  and Akon on Sunday as the Jingle
Bell Ball crams more than 20 acts into two nights that promise
to be a blend of tackiness and high-power glitz.  The winter festival’s stage also will pile on the tinsel
for mini-sets from Jason Derulo and teen favorite band JLS. It’s
hosted by Capital FM radio presenters.  The O2, Peninsula Square, SE10 0DX. Information: +44-20-

Norwegian people since 1947, will stay until just before the
