ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. , a
unit of the largest steelmaker, and supplier  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. 
appointed a third arbitrator to try to resolve their dispute
over prices that has dragged on for the past nine months.  Negotiations between the steel producer and Kumba, the
iron-ore unit of  Anglo American Plc , are continuing,
ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a statement today.  In March, Pretoria-based Kumba canceled a nine-year deal to
supply ore from its Sishen mine to ArcelorMittal at 3 percent
above the cost of production, after the steelmaker missed a
deadline to renew its mineral rights. ArcelorMittal said the
decision could force it to close its Saldanha mill, halt all
exports and fire as many as 4,000 workers.  The dispute “will be a lengthy process,”  Mohamed Kharva ,
an analyst at Nedcor Securities who has a “sell” rating on
ArcelorMittal South Africa, said in an interview from Cape Town.  The producer, controlled by Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal,
said in a separate statement it’s also continuing to consider
the sale of a stake in its business to black investors.  South Africa, seeking to ameliorate the effects of racial
discrimination during white rule under apartheid, sets a minimum
stake in companies that must be held by black investors.  ArcelorMittal South Africa said Aug. 10 it would sell a 26
percent interest to a group of investors including Duduzane Zuma,
the son of the country’s President  Jacob Zuma . The deal is
opposed by minority shareholders including Public Investment
Corp., Africa’s largest pension fund manager, and Sanlam Ltd.  “There’s been lots of resistance and criticism,” said
 Paul Theron , managing director of Johannesburg-based Vestact Pty
Ltd., which manages more than 1 billion rand ($143 million).
