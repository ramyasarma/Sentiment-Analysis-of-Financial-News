Canada’s dollar had its biggest two-
day rally against its U.S. counterpart since May as a gain in
stocks and commodities boosted demand for assets related to
economic growth.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is also known for the
image of the aquatic bid on the C$1 coin, was among the best
performers among the greenback’s most-traded counterparts before
a report tomorrow forecast by economists to show the nation’s
employers added to payrolls for a second month in November.  “The outperformance is quite stark,”  Camilla Sutton ,
chief currency strategist in Toronto at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
Scotia Capital unit, said by phone from Toronto.  The Canadian currency appreciated 1.4 percent to C$1.0026
per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0170 yesterday,
when it advanced 0.9 percent. It touched C$1.0026 today, the
strongest since Nov. 11. One Canadian dollar purchases 99.71
U.S. cents.  The loonie increased 2.3 percent during the past two days,
the most on a closing basis since May 10, when it gained 2.9
percent as crude oil rallied on a European plan to ease the
sovereign-debt crisis. The Canadian dollar touched a level
stronger than parity Nov. 5-11.  The  yield  on 10-year Canadian government bonds rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.20 percent after
touching 3.25 percent, the highest level since July 28. The
price of the 3.5 percent security maturing in June 2020
decreased 23 cents to C$102.50.  U.S. Yield Spread  Canada’s 10-year bonds yielded 20 basis points more than the
equivalent-maturity U.S. security. The yield  spread  was 37 basis
points on Oct. 7, the widest since January 2009.  The  MSCI World Index , a gauge of equities in developed
nations, advanced 1.8 percent. January futures on crude oil
increased $1.25 to $88 a barrel, the highest settlement in more
than two years.  Canada’s dollar should continue climbing “provided
equities remain better bid and the U.S. dollar stays better
offered,”  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at
National Bank of Canada, said by telephone from Toronto.  The loonie extended its gain as a U.S. report from the
National Association of Realtors showed pending home resales for
Canada’s biggest trading partner unexpectedly increased 10
percent in October.  Canada added 19,800 jobs last month after an increase of
3,000 in October, according to the median forecast of 24
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The  unemployment rate  is
expected to be unchanged at 7.9 percent. The report from
Statistics Canada is due at 7 a.m. tomorrow in Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
