Kenya’s government is considering
offering tax incentives and making more land available to
investors to build three- to five-star hotels, Tourism Minister
 Najib Balala  said.  The minister has proposed the idea to the Ministry of
Finance and discussions are ongoing, Balala said in an interview
today in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.  Hotels are full during the high tourist seasons, with the
country on target to meet its goal of attracting 1.2 million
visitors this year, Balala said. Tourism accounts for 11 percent
of gross domestic product in Kenya, making it the second-biggest
foreign exchange earner after horticulture in East Africa’s
biggest economy.  The country, home to Indian Ocean beaches and some of
Africa’s most famous safari parks, is aiming to attract 2
million visitors in 2012 and 3 million in 2015.  In the eight months to August, tourist numbers rose to
701,691 from 611,674 in the year-earlier period, while in the
six months through June earnings jumped 85 percent to 48.5
billion shillings ($603 million), Balala said in October.  Construction in the port city of Mombasa and the
surrounding coastal area popular with holidaymakers has not kept
pace with the business hub of Nairobi, he said.  “During the peak season our hotels are filled over 100
percent,” Balala said. “We are looking for investors to build
quality beds, especially on the coast.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
