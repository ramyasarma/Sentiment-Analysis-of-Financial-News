French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity fell to a record low after a government reshuffle in
November, an opinion poll to be published in Figaro Magazine on
Dec. 4 showed.  Sarkozy’s approval rating fell 2 percentage points from
last month to 24 percent, according to the survey conducted by
TNS-Sofres-Logica for Figaro. Prime Minister Francois Fillon ’s
approval rating slid 3 points to 35 percent.  The pollsters surveyed 1,000 people over age 18 by
telephone between Nov. 26 and Nov. 29. It didn’t provide a
margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
