The White House will release a report
from President  Barack Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisers this
morning that will assess how the expiration of unemployment
benefits will affect families and the broader economy, according
to an administration official.  In a replay of a dispute earlier this year, lawmakers are
deadlocked over how to finance an extension of aid to the long-
term jobless. Today’s report will include state-by-state numbers
on the number of families affected across the country if
Congress doesn’t again extend benefits, according to the
official, who requested anonymity.  This month, more than 2 million Americans will lose the
temporary support, according to the official.  On Nov. 30, Democrats offered to extend benefits for a
year, with the $56 billion cost financed with borrowed money.
Republicans balked, demanding the extension be offset with
savings elsewhere in the government’s budget.  Some Democrats, including Senator  Dick Durbin  of Illinois,
said an extension of unemployment aid should be included as part
of any deal to extend tax cuts enacted during the administration
of President  George W. Bush .  Since December 2007 -- the start of the worst U.S.
recession since the Great Depression -- Congress has extended
the total amount of aid three times so that the unemployed could
receive up to 99 weeks of aid averaging $300 per week. The
government spent about $160 billion on unemployment benefits in
the fiscal year that ended Sept 30, or about what it cost to run
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
