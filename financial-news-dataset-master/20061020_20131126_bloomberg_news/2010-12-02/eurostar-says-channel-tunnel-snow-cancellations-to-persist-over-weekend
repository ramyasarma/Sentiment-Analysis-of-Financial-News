More than one in four Britons plan to
change the way they commute next year mainly because of
increased train and bus fares, according to a report by
recruitment company  reed.co.uk .  About 7 percent of those surveyed, equivalent to more than
2 million workers, aim to change their mode of transportation to
avoid the fare increases, the company said in the report. Six
percent, or 1.7 million workers, will seek to move to a new home
or job over the next 12 months to make their commute easier, the
survey found.  “Huge numbers of people plan to change how they travel to
work next year, as rising fares and increased transport stress
kick in,” said Martin Warnes, managing director of reed.co.uk.
“Many feel driving to work alone in their cars will be their
only option, in spite of growing green and health concerns.”  Train fares will rise by an average 6.2 percent in January
2011, according to figures issued by the U.K.’s Association of
Train Operating Companies last month. London Underground fares
will rise an average of 3.9 percent in January, Mayor  Boris Johnson  said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
