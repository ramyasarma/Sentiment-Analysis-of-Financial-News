     Dec. 3 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose for a fifth day
as the U.S. dollar fell the most in five months, boosting oil
and precious-metal futures.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
increased 1.2 percent as the metal gained for a fifth day. Royal
Bank of Canada, Canada’s largest lender by assets, dropped 4.4
percent after failing to meet the average analyst profit
forecast for the fifth-straight quarter. Suncor Energy Inc., the
country’s biggest oil and gas producer, advanced 1.5 percent as
crude climbed to a 25-month high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 15.42
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,178.95. For the week, the index
rallied 2.2 percent, the most in three months.  “Silver’s on a monster run, gold’s on a monster run and
the U.S. dollar is weak,” said  Steven Conville , who helps
manage C$8 billion ($7.96 billion) at Macquarie Private Wealth
Inc. in Markham, Ontario. “The index is being lifted by a high
concentration in resources.”  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index
advanced 5 percent this week, the most in 13 months, as a gauge
of  Chinese manufacturing  increased more than forecast and the
U.S. dollar retreated after three weeks of gains. Energy and
raw-material companies make up 49 percent of Canadian stocks by
market value, according to Bloomberg data.  The greenback fell 1.4 percent against a basket of world
currencies today after the U.S. reported its unemployment rate
rose to 9.8 percent from 9.6 percent last month. Nonfarm
payrolls increased by 39,000, less than all 27 economist
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Record Run  An  index  of S&P/TSX gold companies climbed for a fourth day
to a record. Barrick rallied 1.2 percent to an all time high of
C$54.22. Producer Gammon Gold Inc. surged 8.5 percent to C$7.79
after Timmins Gold Corp., a rival bidder for Capital Gold Corp.,

to a 30-year high.  Crude oil gained 1.4 percent to $89.19 a barrel in New

increased 2.2 percent to C$31.62.  Canadian Oil Sands Trust, the biggest owner of the Syncrude
project, slumped 12 percent, the most in 24 months, to C$25.05
after saying it expects to declare a quarterly dividend of 20
cents a share next month. The company’s last three shareholder
payouts have been 50 cents a unit, and Bloomberg analysts had
 forecast  a dividend of 35 cents a share for next quarter.  Analysts at Bank of Montreal and UBS AG cut their rating on
Canadian Oil Sands units.  Oilfield services company Trinidad Drilling Ltd. soared 7.9
percent to C$5.89 after announcing a debt offering. Some of the
proceeds will be used to pay off higher-interest debt.  Greg Colman , an analyst at Wellington West Holdings Inc., raised his
12-month price estimate on the shares to C$8.15 from C$7.50,
telling clients the placement will reduce balance sheet risk.  Ivanhoe Energy Inc., which produces oil and gas in China,
soared 9.1 percent to C$2.39 after announcing the completion of
digging of two wells.  Canadian bank stocks fell after Royal Bank said it earned
 84 cents a share  in the fourth quarter, excluding certain items,
trailing the average analyst estimate by 17 percent. Yesterday,
its largest competitor, Toronto-Dominion Bank, reported profit
that missed its average analyst estimate by 5.3 percent,
excluding certain items.  “They’re the heavyweights,” Conville said. “If their
stuff is not good, then that’s letting you know the broader
economy is not as good as we want it to be.”  Earnings Effect  Royal Bank dropped 4.4 percent, the most since May 2009, to
C$53.25. TD declined 1.5 percent to C$72.23. Bank of Nova
