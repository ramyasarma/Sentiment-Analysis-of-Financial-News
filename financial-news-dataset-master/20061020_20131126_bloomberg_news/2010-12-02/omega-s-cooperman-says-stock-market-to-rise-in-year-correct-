U.S. equities will advance about 9
percent during the next year because earnings are rising and
 valuations  are below historical levels, according to money
managers  Leon Cooperman  and  Laszlo Birinyi .  “The economy’s fine, the stock market’s fine,” Cooperman,
who helps oversee more than $5 billion as chief executive
officer of hedge fund Omega Advisors Inc., said at the “Hedge
Funds New York” conference hosted by Bloomberg Link. “The
stock market will be higher if we came back a year from now.”  After an 81 percent rally in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index since a 12-year low in March 2009, Cooperman said equities
are more attractive than bonds even as economic growth is curbed
by debt repayments. His fund gained 54 percent in 2009 and is up
about 19 percent so far for 2010, outperforming the benchmark
for U.S. stocks in both years.  The  S&P 500  has rebounded 19 percent from its 2010 low
reached in July, as the Federal Reserve signaled a commitment to
support the world’s largest economy and more companies beat
earnings estimates for a record sixth straight quarter. The
benchmark gauge trades at a price-earnings ratio of 15.3, below
the 20-year average of 20.6 in data compiled by Bloomberg.  Low Valuations  Birinyi, president and founder of Westport, Connecticut-
based Birinyi Associates Inc., said the U.S. equity gauge will
climb to 1,333 next year, and added that large-cap companies are
good investments because of their cheap  valuations .  “The opportunities to make money are significant,”
Biriyni, whose firm advised clients to buy stocks when the S&P
500 began rising in March 2009, said at today’s conference.  The  S&P 500  gained 1.3 percent to 1,221.53 at 4 p.m. today
in New York, adding to the biggest rally in three months, as
corporate sales beat estimates and European policy makers
extended an emergency loan program.  Investors should put money in stocks instead of cash,
government bonds or high-yield corporate bonds, which have
lower-than-average yields, Cooperman said. The Fed has held the
benchmark lending rate at a record low of zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008.  “To me, it’s easy,” he said. “Common stocks win by
default.” Cooperman said he’d short government bonds if the Fed
hadn’t started a second round of quantitative easing.  Rising Profits  Earnings  are poised for their best annual performance since
1988, with analysts forecasting 37 percent growth this year.
They estimate next year will see a 14 percent increase,
according to projections compiled by Bloomberg News.  Since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s Aug. 27 speech, the
S&P 500 has gained 15 percent. The Fed announced a plan last
month to buy $600 billion in bonds through June to boost the
economy, adding a second round of so-called quantitative easing
since the financial crisis began in 2008.  Birinyi’s forecast for the S&P 500 next year is “probably
reasonable,” said Cooperman, 67. The benchmark should reach
1,215 by the end of this year, according to the average forecast
of 11 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. Of those who have given
2011 estimates, the projection for next year is for the index to
reach 1,337.  To contact the reporters on this story:
