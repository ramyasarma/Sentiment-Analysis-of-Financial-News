Xstrata Plc , the world’s biggest
thermal coal exporter, said zinc and lead output at its Mount
Isa operation in Australia will rise more than 10 percent this
year and next as production costs decline.  “We’re continuing to improve the processing operations as
well as on the mining side,”  Brian Hearne , chief operating
officer for the Zug, Switzerland based company’s Australian zinc
division, said in a phone interview. “It’s going to go up more
than 10 percent this year for zinc, and lead about the same.
Next year is about the same outlook.”  Zinc and lead are the third-biggest contributors to
Xstrata’s operating income, accounting for 13.3 percent in the
six months to June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Zinc, used to help make steel rust-resistant, is the worst
performer on the London Metal Exchange this year, falling 12
percent. Market fundamentals are “the weakest of the base
metals,” Morgan Stanley said in an Oct. 6 report, which said
consumption won’t match production until 2012.  “The outlook for the next 12 months is going to be
volatile,” said Hearne, adding that prices would be helped as
aging large mines near the end of their productive life.  Xstrata , the world’s fourth-biggest zinc producer according
to researcher CRU, rose 2.6 percent to 1,403 pence at the 4:30
p.m. London close yesterday, taking this year’s gain to 25
percent.  Zinc Production  The Mount Isa mine complex in Queensland produced 273,367
metric tons of zinc metal last year as well as 152,301 tons of
lead metal, according to its website. The company’s MacArthur
River mine, in the Northern Territory, produced 143,462 tons of
zinc and 26,929 tons of lead.  China Minmetals Group’s Century zinc mine in Australia, the
world’s second largest, with output capacity of 500,000 tons, is
scheduled to close in 2015. Xstrata’s own Brunswick zinc mine in
Canada will close in 2012, the company said on its web site.
Brunswick last year produced 189,594 metric tons of zinc metal.  “Even if you put every possible increase in production of
all operations that exist plus the ones that are idle, we still
don’t believe that’s going to match the demand,” said Hearne.
He expects “some reasonable” price rises for zinc as well as
lead to come through in “two to three years.” Zinc and lead
often occur in the same ore bodies.  Hearne also said there had been inquiries from India for
Xstrata’s bulk concentrate in the past six months.  Annual processing fees for zinc concentrate charged by
smelters are likely to go up a small amount next year because of
a surplus in concentrate, Hearne said. The so-called benchmark
treatment charges rose to $272.50 a ton on a $2,500 a ton zinc
basis price for 2010, up from $198.50 a ton with a $1,250 a ton
basis price during 2009, according to Xstrata’s half-yearly
report.  “I don’t’ think it’ll be much of an increase at all
because there’s only a slight surplus of concentrate production
to demand,” Hearne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
