(Corrects location of PBF’s headquarters in third
paragraph.)  PBF Energy Co. LLC, the partnership
backed by private-equity firms  Blackstone Group LP  and First
Reserve Corp., agreed to buy Sunoco Inc.’s Toledo refinery in
Ohio for about $400 million.  PBF will pay $200 million in cash and $200 million as a
two-year note, plus up to $125 million based on the refinery’s
future profitability, according to a statement issued today by
Philadelphia-based Sunoco. PBF will also pay for the plant’s
crude oil and fuel inventory, which will be valued at market
prices when the sale is complete, according to the statement.  This would be the third refinery purchase for Parsippany,
New Jersey-based PBF, which agreed to buy two plants from  Valero
Energy Corp . this year. The Toledo refinery is 91 miles (146
kilometers) west of Cleveland and has the capacity to process
170,000 barrels of crude a day. Sunoco bought the refinery, its
first, in 1894, according to its  website .  This is the second refinery sale in two years for Sunoco.
The company sold its refinery in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to  Holly Corp. 
for $65 million in June 2009, after foregoing a $375 million
upgrade of the plant.  Chief Executive Officer  Lynn Elsenhans  said in February
Sunoco was permanently shutting down its Eagle Point refinery in
New Jersey because of “weak industry dynamics.” The company’s
refining unit, which accounted for more than 80 percent of net
income in 2007, was unprofitable in five of the last six
 quarters .  PBF, which was formed in 2008 to acquire U.S. refineries,
agreed in September to purchase Valero’s Paulsboro unit in New
Jersey for about $360 million and an estimated $275 million for
crude inventories and other expenses.  Delaware City  Thomas O’Malley , the chairman of Swiss refining company
 Petroplus Holdings AG , serves as chairman of PBF.  PBF also agreed to buy Valero’s shuttered Delaware City,
Delaware, refinery for $220 million in April, saying that it
would spend up to $150 million to improve the plant. The
refinery is capable of processing 182,200 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Private-equity firms like Blackstone and First Reserve pool
money from investors to take over companies, financing the
purchases mostly with debt with the intention of selling them
later for a profit.  Sunoco  rose  44 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.15 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, before the sale
was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
