SunPower Corp. , the second-biggest
U.S. solar module maker, said it will build projects for a
school district in California and a developer in Italy.  The Mount Diablo Unified School District agreed to buy
solar power systems for 51 schools totaling 11.2 megawatts that
will save the institution $192 million over 30 years, San Jose,
California-based SunPower said today in a statement. The solar
projects will cover parking lots and hard court areas and are
expected to be completed in early 2012.  In Italy, a unit of German utility  E.ON AG  ordered a 3.4-
megawatt ground-mounted system that should be completed in
April, SunPower said today in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
