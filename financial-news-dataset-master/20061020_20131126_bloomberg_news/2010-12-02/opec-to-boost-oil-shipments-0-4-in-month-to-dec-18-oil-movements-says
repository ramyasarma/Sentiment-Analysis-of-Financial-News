The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase crude loadings by 0.4 percent
in the four weeks to Dec. 18, according to tanker-tracker Oil
Movements, as winter demand picks up.  OPEC will meet on Dec. 11 in Quito, Ecuador, to review
quotas.  Shipments  will rise to 23.56 million barrels a day in
the four weeks to Dec. 18 from 23.47 million barrels in the
period to Nov. 20, Oil Movements said today in a report. It’s
the eighth consecutive month-on-month increase, according to the
weekly reports. The data exclude Ecuador and Angola.  Shipments from Middle Eastern producers, including those
from non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen, will rise 0.5 percent to
17.46 million barrels a day from 17.37 million in the four weeks
to Dec. 18, data from Oil Movements show.  OPEC  will probably keep its output quota unchanged at the
Dec. 11 gathering, ministers from Angola, Venezuela said today
and yesterday. Oil at $80 to $85 a barrel is a “comfortable
price,” Angola’s Minister of Petroleum  Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos  said. Crude traded at about $86 a barrel today.  A total of 469.22 million barrels of crude will be on board
tankers in the month to Dec. 18, up 2.2 percent on the Nov. 20
figure of 458.92 million barrels, according to Oil Movements.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships used as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
