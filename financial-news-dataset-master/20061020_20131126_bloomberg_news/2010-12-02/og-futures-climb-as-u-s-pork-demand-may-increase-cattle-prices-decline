Hog futures gained for the first time
in five sessions on speculation that the lowest U.S. pork prices
in a month will spur buying from retailers. Cattle fell.  Yesterday,  wholesale pork  fell 1.7 percent to 76.11 cents a
pound, the lowest since Nov. 1, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture data. The price declined as animal weights last week
rose to the highest level since at least 2002. Hog futures
dropped 3 percent in the previous four sessions, and cattle
jumped yesterday to a 27-month high.  “With cattle trading at these kind of prices over hogs, it
makes pork look a little more attractive on the retail end,”
said  Dick Quiter , an account executive at McFarland Commodities
LLC in Chicago.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.75 cent, or 1
percent, to settle at 76 cents a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 16 percent
this year.  Hog  carcasses  averaged almost 210 pounds (95 kilograms) on
Nov. 26, the most since at least 2002, according to USDA data.  Cattle futures for February delivery dropped 0.3 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $1.06475 a pound.  Meatpackers processed 521,000 cattle in the first four days
of this week, up 5.3 percent from a year ago, according to the
USDA.  “In the cattle, we’ve had a pretty good run,” Quiter
said. “The packers may have what they need to be caught up for
the minute and may not be as aggressive in the next couple of
weeks coming into the Christmas holiday.”  Cattle have gained 24 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.275
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.18675 a pound. On Nov. 30, the price
reached $1.20175, the highest for a most-active contract since
the commodity started trading on Nov. 30, 1971.  To contact the reporter on this story:
