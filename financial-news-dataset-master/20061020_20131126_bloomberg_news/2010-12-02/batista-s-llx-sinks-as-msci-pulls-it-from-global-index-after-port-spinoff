LLX Logistica SA , a Brazilian
logistics company, fell the most in more than two months on
speculation its removal from MSCI’s Global Standard Indices will
reduce demand for the shares.  LLX, controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , is
spinning off its Sudeste port project, which will trade as  PortX
Operacoes Portuarias SA , according to a regulatory filing in
October. The resulting drop in market value prompted MSCI to
move LLX to its Global Small Cap Indices as of the close
tomorrow, MSCI said in an e-mailed statement today.  “You have many funds that are restricted from owning
companies that aren’t on these indices,” said  Maria Tereza Azevedo , an analyst at Link Corretora in Sao Paulo.  LLX fell 3.8 percent, the most since Sept. 17, to 8.18
reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 3 p.m. New York
time. The stock pared an intraday plunge of as much as 6.8
percent on MSCI’s plan to include it in the Small Cap indices,
Azevedo said.  “It’s not the same as being on the main indices, but it
will keep giving visibility to the company,” she said.  PortX will not be added to the Global Standard Indices,
MSCI said. The Sudeste port will be sold to  MMX Mineracao &
Metalicos SA , Batista’s mining company, according to the October
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
