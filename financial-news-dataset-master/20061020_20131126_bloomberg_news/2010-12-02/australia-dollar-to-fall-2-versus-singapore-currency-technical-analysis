Australia’s dollar is poised to drop
almost 2 percent against Singapore’s currency after a technical
indicator signaled that a six-month rally has ended, according
to Standard Chartered Plc.  The South Pacific nation’s currency, known as the Aussie, 
may extend losses after completing a “head-and-shoulders”
reversal pattern on the daily chart on Nov. 29, said  Gerrard Katz , head of foreign-exchange trading at Standard Chartered in
Hong Kong.  “The daily chart shows it has broken the neckline,” Katz
said in an interview yesterday, adding that the overall bias
will be for further weakness. “It seems to be forming a base at
current levels and it could move back up to 1.2700 before the
next big move down to around 1.2450.”  The Australian currency traded at 1.2667 versus its
Singapore counterpart as of 8:30 a.m. in Singapore, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached a 13-month high of 1.3070
on Nov 5. and has since slid more than 3 percent.  A head-and-shoulders is formed when a currency makes three
consecutive peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest.
In this case, the “left shoulder” was formed on Oct. 7, the
“head” on Nov. 5 and the “right shoulder” on Nov. 24. The
reversal pattern was completed when the exchange rate broke
below the “neckline” that was formed on Oct. 29 and Nov. 16.  The 1.2450 target is significant as the 200-day moving
average lies there on the daily chart, Katz said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Moving averages help
traders determine support and resistance levels. Reversal
patterns may indicate the end of a period of sustained rally or
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
