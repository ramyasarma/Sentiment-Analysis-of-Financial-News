Kenya’s shilling strengthened to a
one-week high versus the dollar as demand for the U.S. currency
weakened and as inflows from a sale of tea were expected to come
in, a dealer said.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 1.4 percent to 79.75 per dollar and traded 0.4
percent up at 80.55 at 5 p.m. in Nairobi, the strongest since
Nov. 25, from a close of 80.90 yesterday.  “Most guys are trimming their positions as the year
ends,” Mark Orubia, a treasury dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said by telephone today. “We are also expecting
inflows from the agricultural sector to start coming in.”  Kenya is the world’s biggest exporter of black tea.
The top prices of most grades of African tea rose this week at a
sale in the port city of Mombasa, Africa Tea Brokers Ltd. said
Nov. 30. The top prices of 15 grades climbed, eight fell and one
was unchanged, the broker said.  The euro was higher versus the dollar after the European
Central Bank left interest rates at a record low and ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said it will maintain emergency
liquidity for banks to prevent the region’s debt crisis from
spreading, easing concern about risk and boosting emerging-
market assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
