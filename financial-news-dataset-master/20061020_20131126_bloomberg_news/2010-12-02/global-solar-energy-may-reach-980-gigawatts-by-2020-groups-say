Global solar energy capacity may
reach 980 gigawatts by 2020 as governments worldwide seek to
reduce fossil fuel consumption and cut emissions of greenhouse
gases, a group of renewable energy associations said.  Development of photovoltaic and solar thermal power
projects will cut emissions of carbon dioxide by about 570
million tons over the decade, the equivalent of shutting down
100 coal-fueled power plants or taking 110 million cars off the
road, according to a report released in Cancun, Mexico, today by
the Washington-based  Solar Energy Industries Association .  The report took place as United Nations envoys in Cancun
consider whether to extend the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an
international agreement to cut man-made emissions of carbon
dioxide that scientists say contribute to global warming. The
trade group of 21 associations from around the world urged
governments to include solar energy incentives as part of the
effort to address climate change.  “The capital needed to manufacture that much capacity is
staggering,” said  Nancy Hartsoch , vice president of marketing
at SolFocus Inc., a Palo Alto, California-based maker of
concentrating photovoltaic panels. “And because solar hasn’t
reached grid-parity in most regions, that kind of deployment
would require stronger policies than we’ve got in place now.”  The solar groups plan to discuss their report, which
includes development profiles for 20 countries and the European
Union, during a Dec. 6 presentation in Cancun.  For the U.S., boosting total solar capacity to 139
gigawatts, as the report predicts, would account for 4.9 percent
of the country’s total output, add 683,0000 jobs and help reduce
the cost of electricity to $2.32 a watt from $5.71 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
