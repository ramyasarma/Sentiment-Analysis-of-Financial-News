Pioneer Food Group Ltd. , a South
African manufacturer of cereals and juices, said it has offered
12 rand a share, or 828 million rand ($119 million), for wine
and brandy producer  KWV Holdings Ltd .  A quarter of the payment will be in shares and the rest in
cash if the transaction goes ahead, Paarl-based Pioneer said in
a statement today. The offer is an 11 percent premium to KWV’s
average share price in the 30 days preceding  Oct. 13 , when KWV
first announced it was in talks, Pioneer said.  Pioneer wants to use its South African distribution network
to boost sales of KWV’s top wine brands, Pioneer Managing
Director  Andre Hanekom  said on Nov. 3. The top wines of KWV,
whose brands include Imoya VSOP Alambic Brandy, Pearly Bay and
Roodeberg wines, could be placed into Pioneer’s Ceres Beverage
Co., which already owns Hooch, Pepsi, Mountain Dew and 7-Up.  South Africa’s Competition Tribunal on Nov. 2 approved a
settlement agreement with Pioneer, which produces Weet-Bix
cereal and Heinz Tomato Ketchup, amounting to 1.05 billion rand
for violating antitrust laws in its flour and corn milling unit
and its bakeries, eggs and poultry businesses.  Pioneer has  gained  23 percent in the past 12 months and
added 75 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 48.75 rand in Johannesburg
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
