China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group
Co. restarted the No. 1 reactor at its Daya Bay station after a
radiation leak, the company said on its website. The reactor
started on Nov. 28, the company said.  The leak posed no danger to the public, plant workers or
the environment, China Guangdong said last month, after a fault
on a pipeline bearing coolant from the reactor was found in
October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
