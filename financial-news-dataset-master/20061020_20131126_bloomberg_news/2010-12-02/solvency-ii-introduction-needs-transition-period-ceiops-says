A new risk-based regulatory framework
for European insurers should be introduced with a transition
period, the regulator developing the rules said.  “We should allow a period for the market and supervisors
to adopt,” Gabriel Bernardino, chairman of the Committee of
European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors, or
 Ceiops , said at a conference in Paris today. “We shouldn’t
postpone the introduction of Solvency II, but rather phase in
the implementation.”  Frankfurt-based Ceiops is developing Solvency II together
with local supervisors in Europe. The rules, scheduled for
introduction in 2013, have been tested by the industry in a
fifth quantitative impact study, named  QIS5 . Ceiops plans to
publish the results of the study in March, secretary general
 Carlos Montalvo  said in an interview on Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
