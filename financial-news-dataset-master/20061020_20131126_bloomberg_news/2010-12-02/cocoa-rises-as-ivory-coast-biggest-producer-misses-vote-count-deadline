Cocoa surged the most since October
2009 as a disputed presidential election in Ivory Coast, the
world’s largest grower, threatened to disrupt exports. Sugar and
coffee also advanced.  At least six people were killed and 17 were wounded in a
shooting at the party office of candidate  Alassane Ouattara  last
night. Ivory Coast’s electoral commission named Ouattara the
winner of the Nov. 28 election, a ruling that the Constitutional
Court said was invalid after a deadline was missed to announce
results.  “People are concerned about supplies because of all the
turmoil,” said  Phil Streible , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  Cocoa for March delivery jumped $110, or 4 percent, to
settle at $2,868 a metric ton as of 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York, the most since October 2009. The price still is
down 13 percent this year.  In London, cocoa futures for March delivery gained 60
pounds, or 3.2 percent, to 1,923 pounds ($2,999) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Ivory Coast has been divided between the north and the
government-controlled south since an uprising in 2002.
Supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo hold opposition leader
 Ouattara  responsible for the revolt, while rebels blame the
government for treating northerners as second-class citizens.  “Cocoa is definitely a buy following all the political
tension,” OTCex Group said today in a report. “Things are not
going to be solved in the coming days.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.08 cent, or 0.3
percent, to close at 28.45 cents a pound on in New York. In
London, white sugar for March delivery gained $2.60, or 0.4
percent, to $727.90 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica coffee for March delivery advanced 0.15 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $2.037 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for
March delivery advanced for a third day, adding $32, or 1.8
percent, to $1,848 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
