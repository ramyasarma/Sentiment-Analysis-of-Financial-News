Wall Street’s “unprecedented”
participation in commodity markets will spur “extreme”
volatility for raw materials, said  Mari Kooi , the chief
executive officer of Wolf Asset Management International LLC.  “Pay attention to how it’s different this time,” Kooi
said at the Bloomberg Link Hedge Fund and Investor Briefing in
New York. Supply and demand is “not going to be the ultimate
driver of the extreme volatility we’ll see.”  Commodity assets under management rose $19 billion to a
record $340 billion in October, led by demand for index-linked
investments, Barclays Capital said last week. Raw materials have
surged since 2001 as economic expansion in China prompted
investors to bet on rising prices for energy, grains and metals.
Copper has gained more than fivefold in that time, crude oil
quadrupled and corn more than doubled.  The increased “globalization” of commodities combined
with the bigger roles of banks and other financial institutions
will create a “confluence of events” that “makes this
particular time in history unique,” Kooi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
