Toyota Motor Corp. ’s profit per
vehicle in China for its luxury Lexus brand has eclipsed that of
the U.S., where it has been forced to increase incentives
following record recalls earlier this year.  Even after China’s import duties and higher taxes on luxury
cars, Lexus currently earns more per car in the world’s largest
auto market, said  Karl Schlicht , head of the marque’s global
product and marketing division, citing a weaker dollar. Premium
pricing in China and the higher incentive spending in the U.S.
are also factors, analysts said.  “We’re going through pretty unprecedented times with our
U.S. operations given the quality issue,” Schlicht said in an
interview this week in Nagoya, west of Tokyo. While China is
more profitable at the moment, the U.S. “can be very
profitable. Both are very important markets to us.”  Toyota introduced the Lexus brand in 1989, specifically for
the U.S. market. Lexus sales in China, which began in 1993, will
rise about 50 percent this year, Schlicht said. Deliveries
totaled about 30,400 units in 2009, according to researcher J.D.
Power & Associates. Sales gained 7.7 percent to 201,769 in the
U.S., the brand’s biggest market, this year through November.  Toyota fell 0.5 percent to 3,275 yen as of the 2:49 p.m. in
Tokyo. The stock has fallen 16 percent in 2010.  CT 200h  Deliveries in China next year will be helped by the
introduction of the new sporty  CT 200h  hybrid-only model,
Schlicht said.  Lexus, the top-selling luxury-car brand in the U.S. since
2000, trails behind rivals in China, selling about 20 percent of
luxury leader Volkswagen AG’s Audi brand and a third of  Daimler
AG’s  Mercedes-Benz and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s  deliveries
this year.  In China, importers pay a 25 percent custom duty and a 17
percent value-added tax. Consumption tax, which can reach 40
percent, is based on the car’s engine size, said  Lin Huaibin , an
analyst at industry consultant IHS Automotive in Shanghai.  For a  Lexus GX460  sport-utility vehicle, which starts at
1.16 million yuan ($174,000) in China, Toyota charges a premium
of almost $70,000 after taxes, Lin said. The same vehicle has a
base price of $52,345 in the U.S.  The Lexus LS600hL, the brand’s flagship hybrid sedan, has a
base price of 2.07 million yuan ($311,000) in China, compared
with $110,000 in the U.S.  $990,000 Phantom  “We want to target each region, make sure we’re
competitive and provide a price for that region,” Schlicht
said.  Other luxury automakers also charge higher prices in China.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., BMW’s most luxurious nameplate,
prices its Phantom sedan from 6.6 million yuan ($990,000),
compared with a starting price of $380,000 in the U.S.  A stronger yen against the dollar is also cutting U.S.
profit for Lexus, which exports all models from Japan except the
Canada-built RX SUV. The yen was at 83.77 to the dollar as of
10:24 a.m. in Tokyo today, after touching 80.22 against the
dollar on Nov. 1, the highest level since April 1995.  Every one-yen appreciation against the dollar cuts Toyota’s
operating profit by 30 billion yen ($357 million) as the yen-
value of repatriated earnings falls.  Earlier this week, Toyota said U.S. Lexus sales dropped 1.4
percent in November, compared with a 30 percent surge at BMW and
an 8.4 percent gain at Mercedes-Benz. Lexus still holds the lead
this year through November.  Higher Incentives  The company more than tripled incentive spending per
vehicle in October from a year earlier and almost doubled them
last month, according to Autodata Corp.  Higher spending on incentives means Lexus models may
account for about a third of U.S. operating profit, down from as
much as half in the year through March 2008, said  Koji Endo , an
auto analyst at Advanced Research Japan in Tokyo.  When the dollar strengthens again, profitability should
improve, Schlicht said.  The automaker, based in Toyota City, Japan, has been
struggling to recover its image after recalling Toyota and
Lexus-brand models, including more than eight million vehicles
worldwide for problems relating to unintended acceleration.  While incentives cut profitability, they are necessary as
the recalls this year have affected sales, Schlicht said.  “We know it’s high, but we think it’s better for the
brand,” Schlicht said. “It’s something we as a group, the
company, thinks we need to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
