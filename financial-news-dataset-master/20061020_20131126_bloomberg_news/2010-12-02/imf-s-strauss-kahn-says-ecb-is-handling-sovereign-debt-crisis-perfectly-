The European Central Bank is doing
its job “perfectly” in handling the region’s debt crisis,
International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Dominique Strauss- Kahn  said.  Speaking to reporters in New Delhi today, Strauss-Kahn said
that after Greece and Ireland, which received bailouts while
“at the edge of the cliff,” some other countries in Europe are
“not far from the edge of the cliff.” The whole euro region
“has now to deal with medium-term fiscal consolidation,” he
said.  The ECB, which today left its benchmark rate unchanged,
will delay its withdrawal of emergency liquidity measures to
combat “acute” market tensions, President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
told reporters in Frankfurt today. The central bank’s bond-
purchase program is “ongoing,” he said while declining to
comment further on its scope.  The debt crisis that spread from Greece to Ireland now
threatens to engulf the entire euro-area. Speculation the debt
crisis will spread to Portugal and Spain grew after an 85
billion-euro ($111 billion) aid package for Ireland, led by
European Union governments and the IMF, was authorized on Nov.
28.  Strauss-Kahn also said growth is “likely” to be sluggish
in Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
