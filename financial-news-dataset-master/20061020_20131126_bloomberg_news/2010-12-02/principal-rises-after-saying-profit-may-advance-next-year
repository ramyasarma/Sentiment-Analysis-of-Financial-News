Principal Financial Group Inc. , the
seller of life insurance and retirement products, advanced in
New York trading after saying profit may rise next year.  Principal climbed $1, or 3.6 percent, to $29.16 at 10:13
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The firm has
jumped 21 percent this year, beating the 16 percent gain of the
24-company KBW Insurance Index.  Operating profit per share next year will probably be $2.80
to $3, the Des Moines, Iowa-based firm said in a statement late
yesterday. That compares with the $2.63 average estimate for
2010 profit of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We feel very good about where we’re at in the fourth
quarter,” a company executive said in a conference call today.
“We feel very good about where we are going into 2011.”  The insurer’s outlook was boosted to positive from stable
by Standard and Poor’s yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
