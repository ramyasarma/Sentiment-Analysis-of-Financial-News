Deutsche Bank AG is seeking a buyer
for its Frankfurt headquarters, three years after purchasing the
twin towers dubbed Debit and Credit and reconstructing the
buildings to make them energy efficient, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing unidentified people familiar with
the situation.  A Deutsche Bank spokesman confirmed the plan to the German
newspaper. The Frankfurt-based lender bought the buildings for
272 million euros ($356 million) in 2007 from one of its own
funds, according to FTD. It spent 200 million euros on making
them more environmentally friendly and may generate 500 million
euros from a sale, the newspaper said.  Deutsche Bank may lease the buildings back from a potential
buyer, FTD said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
