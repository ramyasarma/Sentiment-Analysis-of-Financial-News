Sony Corp. , the world’s third-largest
television maker, rose to the highest in more than six months in
Tokyo trading after analysts increased their price estimates for
the stock.  Sony  climbed  1.5 percent to 3,060 yen as of 9:42 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, poised for the highest close since May
13. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.7 percent.  Profit growth in the so-called BRICs markets of Brazil,
Russia, India and China, and of devices including semiconductors
may drive gains in the stock, Shunsuke Tsuchiya, a Tokyo-based
 analyst  at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a report yesterday.
He increased the price estimate by 13 percent to 3,600 yen.  CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets raised its estimate by 17 percent
to 4,200 yen. Nikko Cordial Corp. started coverage of the stock
on Nov. 30 with an “outperform” rating and price estimate of
3,280 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
