Technip SA , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, said it won a contract worth $908
million to revamp and expand an Algerian refinery.  The refurbishment of existing installations owned by
Sonatrach, Algeria’s national oil company, will raise refining
capacity to 3.6 million tons annually from 2.7 million tons,
according to a statement from Paris-based Technip.  The new units will allow the refinery to produce gasoline
at “similar specifications” as those needed for Europe,
Technip said.  In addition to the Algeria tender, Technip is also studying
tenders in Brazil for new vessels, in the Middle East for
“selective” onshore projects, especially Saudi Arabia, and in
China, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko said last month.
Technip is “very active” in a project for a petrochemicals
plant in Saudi Arabia, he said at the time.  The company said yesterday it had won an order from Total
SA to raise capacity at the Normandy refinery in Gonfreville,
France. The project, which will allow the facility to make more
diesel and kerosene, will cost more than 100 million euros ($132
million), one-fifth of which will go to Technip, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
