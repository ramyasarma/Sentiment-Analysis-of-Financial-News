DirecTV , the largest U.S. satellite-
television provider, projected accelerating subscriber gains for
this quarter, signaling the company may keep winning customers
at the expense of cable-TV carriers.  DirecTV expects to add a net 200,000 U.S. subscribers in
the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Mike White  said at
the company’s investor event in New York today. Last quarter,
DirecTV added a net 174,000 U.S. customers.  White is attracting customers with exclusive programming
and premium products, including “ NFL  Sunday Ticket” and high-
definition and digital-video-recording services. The focus on
users with higher disposable incomes has helped DirecTV increase
sales in a sluggish economy. Its gains contrast with basic-video
customer declines at cable carries, which together lost 741,000
users last quarter, according to research firm SNL Kagan.  “DirecTV is well-positioned for continued success,” White
said. “We are confident we have a winning strategy.” DirecTV is
on track for the best quarter of the year in terms of sales and
customer gains, he said.  DirecTV, based in El Segundo, California, will boost its
earnings to $5 a share on sales of $30 billion in 2013, White
predicted. For this year, analysts  project  earnings of $2.36 a
share on sales of $24 billion.  U.S. operating profit before depreciation and amortization
will grow in the low-to-mid single digits in 2011 and the mid-
to-upper single digits in 2012 and 2013. By 2013, DirecTV aims
to have 30 million customers, up from about 27 million now.  IPad, Facebook  DirecTV is adding new features to lure new subscribers and
keep existing ones. Next quarter, it will unveil an application
for  Apple Inc. ’s iPad that lets customers search a customized TV
guide, program their DVRs, and use the device as a remote
control. DirecTV is also working to integrate social-networking
sites like Facebook and Twitter into the TV-watching experience.  The company is also the largest pay-TV operator in Latin
America, with a third of its sales growth coming from market-
share gains, said  Bruce Churchill , DirecTV president for the
region.  DirecTV has added a net 842,000 customers in Latin America
this year, with sales of $2.6 billion and an operating profit
before depreciation and amortization of $822 million. The
company predicted sales and earnings growth of 20 percent for
Latin America next year, with both increasing in the low-to-mid
teens in 2012 and 2013.  “Our competitive advantages are sustainable,” Churchill
said. “The opportunity is large and growing.”  DirecTV  declined  32 cents to $40.91 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares have gained 23
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
