The U.S. House began its debate today
on whether to censure Democratic Representative  Charles Rangel 
of New York for ethics violations, including soliciting
donations for an academic center bearing his name and failing to
fully pay his income taxes.  Under a censure, Rangel will stand on the House floor as
Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat, reads the
resolution outlining his violations. A censure will be a blemish
on Rangel’s 40-year record in the House, though it won’t keep
him from continuing to serve. He was re-elected Nov. 2 to a 21st
term, winning 80 percent of the vote in his Harlem-based
district.  The House ethics committee voted Nov. 18 to recommend that
Rangel be censured and directed to pay back taxes on rental
income from his villa in the Dominican Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
