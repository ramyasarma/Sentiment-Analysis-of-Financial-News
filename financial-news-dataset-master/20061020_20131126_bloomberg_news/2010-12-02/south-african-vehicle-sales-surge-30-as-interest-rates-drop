South African vehicle sales surged 30
percent in November from a year earlier after the central bank
cut its benchmark interest  rate  for a third time this year,
fueling spending.  A total of 44,371 vehicles were sold last month, the
Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of South Africa said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales
growth accelerated from 22 percent in October.  The Reserve Bank cut its repurchase rate by half a
percentage point to 5.5 percent on Nov. 18, the ninth reduction
since December 2008, spurring spending in Africa’s biggest
 economy . Vehicle exports have also rebounded, adding to the
recovery in manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the
economy.  “New vehicle sales over the medium term will remain a
function of the performance of the domestic economy and, in the
case of export sales, the sustainability of the recovery in the
global economy,” the association said.  Car exports climbed 24 percent to 28,550 as production
recovered from strikes in August and September, the association
said.  Passenger car sales will probably increase between 7.5
percent and 10 percent in 2011, while commercial vehicles such
as minivans and pick-up trucks are estimated to increase 15
percent, the association said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
