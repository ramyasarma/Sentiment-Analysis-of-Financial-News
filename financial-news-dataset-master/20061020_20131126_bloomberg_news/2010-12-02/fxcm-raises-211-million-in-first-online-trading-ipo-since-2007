FXCM Inc.  climbed  6.1 percent  in its
first day of trading after the provider of currency trading on
the Internet for individual investors raised $211 million in its
initial public offering.  The operator of the  DailyFX.com  website gained 85 cents to
$14.85 in New York Stock Exchange trading after earlier
advancing as high as $15.34. New York-based FXCM sold 15.1
million shares at $14 each yesterday after offering them at $13
to $15, according to a  filing  with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and a statement.  The initial sale was the first by an online trading
platform since  Interactive Brokers Group Inc.  in May 2007 and
followed the busiest month for U.S. IPOs in three years, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Foreign-exchange trading by
individual investors has surged 12-fold since 2001, according to
Boston-based Aite Group LLC.  FXCM is “somewhat unique in terms of its offering,” said
 Walter Todd , co-chief investment officer at Greenwood, South
Carolina-based Greenwood Capital, which oversees about $900
million. “Retail investors are looking, rightly or wrongly, for
alternatives to what they’ve done in the past. Foreign exchange
would be one of those areas.”  Credit Suisse Group AG  of Zurich and New York-based
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. led the IPO, the
prospectus said. FXCM will use proceeds to fund acquisitions.  November IPOs  The initial sale was the only IPO scheduled for this week
after 23 companies completed offerings last month, the most
since November 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Detroit-
based  General Motors Co.  sold $18.1 billion of common shares in
the second-largest U.S. IPO on record.  FXCM’s  profits climbed 16 percent to $79.4 million in the
first nine months of 2010 after rising 12 percent in the
previous four years, according to its SEC filing.  Revenue  increased 6.5 percent to $264 million in the first
three quarters of this year. Trading from individual investors
accounted for 94 percent of sales in 2009, the prospectus said.  The IPO valued FXCM at 16 times 2010 earnings, a 43 percent
discount to the median of five companies cited in the IPO
prospectus as competitors, data compiled by Marina del Rey,
California-based IPOdesktop.com and Bloomberg show.  ‘Positive Sign’  “They brought the deal at a fairly attractive price,”
said  Timothy Cunningham , a money manager at Santa Fe, New
Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management, which oversees
about $70 billion. “It’s a moderately positive sign that they
got this done at the middle of the range.”  Interactive Brokers , the Greenwich, Connecticut-based
options market maker, trades at 28 times estimated 2010
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  OptionsXpress
Holdings Inc. , the online derivatives brokerage in Chicago that
completed an IPO in 2005, is valued at 21.2 times profit.  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. , the Omaha, Nebraska-based
retail brokerage, trades at 17.8 times earnings for the year
ended in September. E*Trade Financial Corp. of New York is
valued at 447 times estimated 2010 profit and 26.6 times 2011
earnings, analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gain Capital Holdings Inc. , the Bedminster, New Jersey-
based operator of FOREX.com, registered with the SEC in August
2009 to sell stock in an IPO. The company said in an amended
 filing  today that it plans to offer 11 million shares for $13 to
$15 each.  Foreign Exchange Trading  Gain Capital is seeking to go public after foreign exchange
trading totaled an average of $4 trillion a day in April 2010,
about 20 percent higher than three years earlier, according to
data compiled by the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank of
International Settlements.  Average daily currency trading by individual investors
totaled about $125 billion in 2009, an increase from $10 billion
in 2001, according to  Sang Lee , managing partner at Aite Group,
an advisory firm for the financial-services industry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
