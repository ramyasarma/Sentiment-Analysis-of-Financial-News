Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-largest bank, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 22 percent after the bank posted a loss on its structured
credit business.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 was C$500 million
($493 million), or C$1.17 a share, compared with C$644 million,
or C$1.56, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to C$3.25
billion.  CIBC’s earnings were reduced by C$239 million from losses
tied to a structured credit business that it’s exiting, along
with capital repatriation costs. The bank also had a C$45
million reversal on credit loss provisions.  CIBC said it earned C$1.68 a share excluding items, higher
the C$1.63-a-share average  estimate  of 14 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  CIBC  rose  C$2, or 2.5 percent, to C$81.05 yesterday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange, its biggest increase in three months.
The stock has risen 19 percent this year, compared with the 8.9
percent rise of the 10-company S&P/TSX Banks Index.  The bank set aside C$150 million for bad loans, down from
C$424 million a year earlier.  Earnings from CIBC’s consumer lending business rose 23
percent to C$576 million, while its investment-banking business
posted a loss of C$56 million, compared with C$160 million
profit a year earlier.  Hardest Hit  Canadian Imperial was the hardest hit among the country’s
banks during the financial crisis, recording C$10.9 billion in
debt-related writedowns since the collapse of the U.S. subprime
market in 2007. The bank has been unwinding the debt-related
activities that led to the charges.  Canadian Imperial is the country’s second bank to report
fourth-quarter results. Montreal-based National Bank of Canada,
the country’s sixth-biggest bank, said yesterday that profit
beat estimates.  Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada’s second-biggest bank, also
reports today. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest
lender, and Bank of Nova Scotia, the No. 3 bank, report
tomorrow. Bank of Montreal, the fourth-biggest Canadian bank,
reports results Dec. 7.  (CIBC will hold an earnings conference call at 8 a.m. Toronto-
time at +1-416-695-6622 or +1-800-766-6630 or at www.cibc.com)  To contact the reporter on this story:
