Investors may sell the euro
regardless of whether the European Central Bank steps up
measures to stem the region’s debt crisis at a meeting of policy
makers today, according to Societe Generale SA.  “Failure to do something will see the crisis return in
force after yesterday’s mini-hiatus,” Kit Juckes , London-based
head of foreign-exchange research, said in an e-mailed note
received today. It’s also “hard to see” how buying bonds under
a so-called quantitative-easing program “is really good for the
euro so it feels like a sell either way,” he wrote.  The announcement of an unsterilized bond-buying plan
“would surely lead to a big sell-off in bund s ,” Societe
Generale analysts Vincent Chaignea u , Aro Razafindrakola  and Hugues Nak a  wrote in a separate report yesterday. “This,
however, is unlikely to happen,” they said.  The euro appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.3154 at 12:01 p.m.
in London. The yield on the 10-year German bund climbed two
basis points to 2.81 percent.  The ECB will leave its main interest rate at 1 percent
today, according to all 52 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
