Government funding for London’s
police, firefighters and transport will be cut by as much as 25
percent, forcing Mayor  Boris Johnson  into “tough choices” on
spending, the  Greater London Authority’s  Budget Committee said.  Funding for transport will be cut by 21 percent, or 2.2
billion pounds ($3.4 billion), in real terms by 2015, the panel
said in a report published today. The 3.6 billion-pound annual
police budget will be reduced by as much as 12 percent in cash
terms, while spending on the fire service and emergency planning
will drop by 25 percent in real terms over the same period.  “Already we are hearing that there will be over 1,000
fewer police officers next year,” the committee chairman,  John Biggs , said in an e-mailed statement. “It remains to be seen
what impact this will have on the service delivered by the
police and which other key London services will be affected.”  Johnson, a member of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
Conservative Party, will have to make “difficult decisions”
over where the ax will fall and where to allocate money raised
from council-tax payers, the committee said.  Britain faces the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War II
to tame the  record budget deficit , prompting the loss of 330,000
public-sector jobs across the country by April 2015, the
independent Office for Budget Responsibility said Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
