Gartmore Group Ltd. , the U.K. fund
manager that put itself up for sale last month, will cut more
than 10 percent of its U.K. workforce to help lower costs, a
personal with knowledge of the decision said.  The fund manager will eliminate 35 out of its 318 U.K.
employees, said the person, who declined to be named because the
information hasn’t yet been made public. The job cuts will focus
on support roles, the person said.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Meyer  last month said he
would either merge Gartmore with another firm or seek a buyer
after five fund managers including  Roger Guy  and  Guillaume Rambourg  quit.  Henderson Group Plc , Gartmore’s second-largest
shareholder, is a possible buyer, while Threadneedle Asset
Management Ltd. and Newton Investment Management Ltd. may be
potential merger partners, according to Sarah Ing, an analyst at
Singer Capital Markets Ltd. in London.  Gartmore said on Nov. 8 it plans to cut costs by 10 million
pounds a year. The stock dropped 0.95 pence, or 1 percent, to
96.95 pence at 10:27 a.m. in London.  The job cuts were reported earlier in What Investment
magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
