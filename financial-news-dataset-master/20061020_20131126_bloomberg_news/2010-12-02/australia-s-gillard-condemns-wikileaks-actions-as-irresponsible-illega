Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  condemned the release of U.S. diplomatic cables and
other documents on the WikiLeaks.org website as “illegal.”  The government is being briefed on the information that has
been disclosed and will go through the documents to assess their
implications, Gillard told  4BC radio  in Australia today.  WikiLeaks receives material that governments and businesses
seek to keep secret and publishes them. The non-profit group on
Nov. 28 began releasing more than 250,000 U.S. State Department
documents that officials wanted to keep confidential.  “I absolutely condemn the placement of this information on
the WikiLeaks website,” Gillard said today. ‘It is a grossly
irresponsible thing to do and an illegal thing to do.’’  Julian Assange , the 39-year-old founder of the website, is
an Australian national.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
