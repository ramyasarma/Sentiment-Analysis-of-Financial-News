Quebec Finance Minister  Raymond Bachand  boosted his deficit forecast for the current fiscal year
as he set aside C$100 million ($99.6 million) more to cover
unforeseen spending.  Bachand, who was speaking at a press conference in Quebec
City, said the 2010-11 deficit for Canada’s second-most populous
province is  now projected  to be C$4.6 billion, higher than the
C$4.5 billion previously estimated. Quebec raised its budget
contingency for the year to C$400 million from C$300 million,
and also set aside C$300 million for 2011-12 and C$200 million
for 2012-13.  “We are staying the course, but we are also increasing
provisions out of prudence because of the economic uncertainty
that exists in the U.S.,” Bachand said.  Quebec’s 2011-12 deficit will be C$3.2 billion, Bachand
said today, compared with a C$2.9 billion projection in March.
The 2009-10 deficit is estimated to be C$3.2 billion, C$1.1
billion less than earlier projected.  Bachand said the government now expects gross domestic
product in the province to climb by 2.6 percent this calendar
year, compared with a March forecast of 2.3 percent. Next year,
the government’s forecast calls for growth of 2.2 percent, down
from a March prediction of 2.6 percent.  Quebec expects its gross debt, which includes pension plan
deficits, to rise to C$197.1 billion by March 2015, from C$163.3
billion this year, Finance Ministry documents show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
