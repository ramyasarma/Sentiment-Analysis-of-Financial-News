Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga
said a report that he had called for homosexuals in the East
African country to be arrested was incorrect.  The Daily Nation reported on Nov. 29 that Odinga told
supporters in his constituency that gay people should be
arrested because same-sex relationships are unnatural.  “I did not say anywhere that the police will arrest the
gays because I know of gay rights,” Odinga said at a conference
today in Nairobi, the capital. “Nothing could be further from
truth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
