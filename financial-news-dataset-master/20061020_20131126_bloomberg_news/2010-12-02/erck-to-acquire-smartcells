Merck & Co. , the second-biggest U.S.
drug company, agreed to pay as much as $500 million for closely
held SmartCells Inc., maker of an experimental diabetes
treatment designed to better regulate insulin in the blood.  SmartCells will receive upfront cash plus additional
payments if products developed from the treatment meet clinical
and regulatory goals, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck
said in a statement today. Investors in Beverly, Massachusetts-
based SmartCells may get more money depending on future sales,
according to the statement.  Diabetes drugs led by Januvia, Merck’s third-biggest
seller, generated $2.58 billion in  revenue  last year, almost 10
percent of the company’s sales. SmartCells fits Merck’s strategy
of augmenting existing products with small deals while chasing
opportunities outside the U.S., said  Les Funtleyder , a Miller
Tabak & Co. portfolio manager in New York.  “We obviously know diabetes is a big, big problem, both
here in the U.S. and in emerging markets,” Funtleyder said in a
telephone interview. “This is in their wheelhouse. They’re
familiar with the class of drugs, familiar with the disease, so
it seems like a good deal.”  Merck rose 16 cents, or less than a percent, to $35.22 in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading  at 4 p.m. The shares
have declined 4.3 percent in 12 months.  The drugmaker has announced 14 pending or completed
acquisitions in the past five years, with an average premium of
73 percent. The largest was its 2009 purchase of Schering-Plough
for $51 billion.  Pfizer  Inc., based in New York, is the biggest U.S.
drugmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
