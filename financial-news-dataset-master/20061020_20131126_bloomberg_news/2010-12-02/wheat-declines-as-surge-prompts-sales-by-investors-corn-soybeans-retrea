Wheat declined from the highest price
in almost a month, and corn and soybeans fell, as investors
locked in gains after yesterday’s rally.  March-delivery wheat dropped as much as 1 percent to $7.325
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after yesterday jumping
as much as 7.9 percent to the highest price since Nov. 12. The
contract was at $7.39 a bushel by 2:11 p.m. in Singapore.  “It’s just profit-taking,” Tetsu Emori, a commodity fund
manager at Astmax Co. Ltd., said by phone from Tokyo, referring
to the reason for the price declines. “People have to make
money by the end of the year.”  Still, investors and importers remain concerned about the
global supply of high-quality wheat used in food, as import
demand expands, helping sustain the rally, he said.  High-quality wheat may be “in short supply” in the
2010-2011 season after rain hurt crops in Australia and Europe
and dry weather curbed production in Russia, Martell Crop
Projections said yesterday.  Wet weather in eastern Australia has delayed harvesting,
with southern New South Wales and Victoria receiving more than
100 millimeters (3.9 inches) of rain in November, three times
the normal amount, forecaster Gail Martell, the head of
Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin-based company, said in a report.  As much as 30 percent of the crop in New South Wales,
Australia’s biggest wheat-producing state, may be downgraded to
feed grade, suitable only for animals, because of excessive
rain, said Peter Matthews, a specialist at Industry & Investment
NSW. In the U.S., dry weather in the western Great Plains has
threatened winter crops.  ‘Devastating Losses’  Feed volumes could reach 20 percent to 30 percent of the
state’s crop, estimated at 9.2 million tons, compared with 4
percent to 5 percent normally, he said.  While some wheat in Australia’s east may be downgraded to
feed quality because of excess rain, low rainfall in Western
Australia during the growing season caused “devastating
losses” and a “very poor” harvest in the country’s top
producing state, according to Martell.  Higher-quality grain from France and the U.K. “is flying
off the shelf,” after a “super-wet harvest” in Germany,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary this year
damaged wheat quality in those countries, Martell said.  Corn for March delivery lost 0.9 percent to $5.61 a bushel
after closing 4.1 percent higher yesterday. January-delivery
soybeans slipped 0.4 percent to $12.775 a bushel, after
advancing 3.2 percent yesterday.  Rough-rice for January delivery rose for a fourth day,
gaining 0.5 percent to $14.44 per 100 pounds. Bangladesh, South
Asia’s biggest rice importer, plans to more than double overseas
purchases to 600,000 tons in the year that began July 1, Badrul
Hasan, director for procurement at the Directorate General of
Food, said Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
