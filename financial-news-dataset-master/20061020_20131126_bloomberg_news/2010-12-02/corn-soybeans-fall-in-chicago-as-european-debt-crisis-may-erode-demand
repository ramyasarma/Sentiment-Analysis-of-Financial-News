Corn and soybeans fell on speculation
that the debt crisis in Europe will spread, damping prospects
for the global economy and demand for U.S. crops.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
the ECB will delay the withdrawal of emergency liquidity
measures and keep buying government bonds as the debt crisis
creates “acute” tensions in financial markets. Yesterday, corn
had the biggest gain in almost six weeks, and soybeans jumped
more than 3 percent.  “The European debt problems have the markets on the
defensive,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities
Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. “The market is void of any fresh
positive news to bring in new buying after the rallies.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $5.6275 a bushel at 10:30 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Yesterday, the price climbed 4.1 percent.  Soybean futures for January delivery dropped 2 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $12.81 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached
$12.87, the highest since Nov. 16.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest grower and exporter of the
commodities.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans at $31.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
