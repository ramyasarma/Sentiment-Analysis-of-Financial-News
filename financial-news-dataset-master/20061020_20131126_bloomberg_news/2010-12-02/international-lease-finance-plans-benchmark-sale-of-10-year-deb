American International Group Inc. ’s
aircraft-leasing unit plans to sell $1 billion of 10-year notes,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  International Lease Finance Corp. may issue the debt at a
yield of 8.375 percent, said the person, who declined to be
identified because terms aren’t set.  ILFC, which has sold $7.15 billion of debt this year, is
tapping the corporate bond market for the third time in 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering follows a
$2 billion, two-part sale by AIG on Nov. 30, the New York-based
parent’s first since before its 2008 rescue by the U.S.
government.  Proceeds from ILFC’s sale may be used for general corporate
purposes, including repayment of debt, ILFC said today in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Standard &
Poor’s assigned the notes a grade of BB+, one step below
investment grade, it said in a statement.  ILFC faces $5.3 billion of debt maturing next year and $6.2
billion coming due in 2012, the company said in the filing,
which didn’t specify the size or timing of the offering.
Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS AG
are managing the sale, according to the filing.  ILFC last sold debt on Aug. 11, when it issued $4.4 billion
of bonds in a four-part offering, Bloomberg data show. The $500
million unsecured notes due in September 2017 that were part of
that transaction traded at 106 cents on the dollar to yield 7.71
percent on Nov. 30, according to Trace, the bond price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
