Japanese  stocks  rose for a second day,
driving up the Nikkei 225 Stock Average by the most in two weeks,
after U.S. economic reports and speculation Europe’s debt crisis
will be contained boosted confidence in a global recovery.  Canon Inc., which is the world’s biggest camera maker and
gets more than 80 percent of its sales abroad, advanced 2.5
percent, as the dollar strengthened against the yen after U.S.
payrolls and manufacturing climbed last month. Mitsubishi Corp.,
Japan’s largest commodities trader, rose 1.3 percent as oil and
metal prices increased.  Nomura Holdings Inc.  led brokerages
higher on the prospects of swelling trading profits.  “The macro-economy is improving pretty well,” said
 Seiichiro Iwamoto , who helps oversee $35 billion in Tokyo at
Mizuho Asset Management Co. “The currency market’s stability
following the growth in manufacturing is supporting the Japanese
stock market.”  The Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8 percent to 10,168.52 at 3 p.m. in
Tokyo, the biggest gain since Nov. 18 and the highest close
since June 21. The broader  Topix  index climbed 1.3 percent to
877.21, with more than five shares advancing for each that fell.  The Topix has retreated 3.3 percent this year, compared
with gains of 8.2 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
the U.S. and 5.2 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Shares
in the Japanese benchmark are valued at 15.2 times estimated
 earnings  on average, compared with 14.2 times for the S&P 500
and 11.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  ‘Sign of Optimism’  Japanese  capital spending , excluding software, rose 4.8
percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier,
the Finance Ministry said today. While less than the 6 percent
median forecast of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
it was the first increase since the quarter ended March 2007.  “The market is taking the result positively,” Mizuho
Asset Management’s Iwamoto said. “We finally had a sign of
optimism in Japan’s capital spending.”  Canon rose 2.5 percent to 4,050 yen and was the  biggest
single support  for the Topix. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-
biggest carmaker by sales, increased 1.8 percent to 3,135 yen.
Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of chip-testing
equipment, leapt 5.4 percent to 1,791 yen, the most since July.  The S&P 500 surged yesterday in New York by 2.2 percent,
the most since Sept. 1. A report from ADP Employer Services
showed businesses added 93,000 workers in November, more than
the 70,000 expected by economists, based on the median of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Separately, the Institute for
Supply Management said its factory index, a gauge of
manufacturing, held near a five-month high.  Economic Recovery  “An economic recovery in the U.S. will likely precede
recovery in Japan,” said Hitoshi Itagaki, president of
Principal Global Investors (Japan) Ltd., which manages about 150
billion yen.  The dollar appreciated to 84.40 yen last night in Tokyo,
near the highest level since Sept. 27. A stronger dollar boosts
the value of U.S. income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 2 percent yesterday, the
most since Sept. 1, amid speculation European Central Bank
policy makers may step up measures to contain the region’s
government-debt crisis.  “We are seeing promising signs in the economy and market
sentiment is improving globally,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Improving market sentiment should
boost money flow into risk assets.”  Brokerages, Traders Advance  Brokerages had the second-biggest gain among the Topix’s 33
industry groups on speculation rising stock prices will boost
trading revenue and earnings.  Nomura Holdings , Japan’s biggest brokerage, jumped 2.7
percent to 491 yen. Daiwa Securities Group Inc., the No. 2,
climbed 2.9 percent to 389 yen. SBI Holdings Inc. leapt 3.2
percent to 11,700 yen.  “If market volume increases, earnings at brokerages and
insurance companies should rise,” Iwamoto said.  Mitsubishi rose 1.3 percent to 2,162 yen, the highest close
since April 30. Mitsui & Co., which counts commodities as its
largest source of profit, gained 1.2 percent to 1,334 yen.

since Nov. 11. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum climbed 2.6
percent yesterday, the most since Nov. 4.  Yahoo Japan Corp. , the operator of Japan’s most-visited
Internet portal, advanced 2.1 percent to 31,300 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper said Japan’s Fair Trade Commission approved a
partnership between the company and U.S.-based Google Inc., the
world’s most popular Internet-search engine.  Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. , a maker of video-game and
pachinko machines, surged 5.6 percent to 1,529 yen, the highest
in more than three years. The company outlined plans to buy back
as much as 5.3 percent of its shares and cancel 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
