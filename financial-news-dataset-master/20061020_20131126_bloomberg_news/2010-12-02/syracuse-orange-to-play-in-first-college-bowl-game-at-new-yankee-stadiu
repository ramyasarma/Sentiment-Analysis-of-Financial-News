Syracuse University will play in the
inaugural college football bowl game at the new Yankee Stadium,
the first postseason game for the Orange in six seasons.  Syracuse accepted an invitation this morning to play in the
Pinstripe Bowl, the school said in a release. The game,
scheduled for Dec. 30, will pit the Orange against a team from
the Big 12 conference.  Syracuse is 246 miles (396 kilometers) from New York City.
The Orange are 7-4 this season, and 4-3 in the Big East -- the
first season since 2004 that the team reached the six-win
requirement for bowl eligibility.  “This is a fabulous opportunity for our institution as
many alums live in the area and our fans can descend upon New
York City for the holidays,” Syracuse Athletic Director Daryl
Gross said in the statement.  The Pinstripe Bowl is the first bowl game in the Bronx
since the University of Nebraska beat the University of Miami in
the 1962 Gotham Bowl in the original Yankee Stadium. The Orange
played in the first football game at the original stadium, a 3-0
win over the University of Pittsburgh in 1923. The new $1.5
billion Yankee Stadium was completed in 2009 and seats 54,251
for football.  Syracuse coach  Doug Marrone , a Bronx native, said the game
and its location would help re-energize a program that has
fallen on hard times. Syracuse won a national title in 1959 and
from 1987 through 1999 played in 11 bowl games. Since 2000, the
team is 46-77 and has played just two postseason games.  “The opportunity to play in the Pinstripe Bowl in my
hometown is part of the whole dream,” Marrone said in the
statement. “New York State is our foundation. This is another
step in our return to prominence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
