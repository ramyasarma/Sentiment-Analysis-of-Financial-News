China will “steadily” push forward
property tax reform during the five years from 2011 to 2015, the
Securities Times reported, citing Zhou Chuanhua, a department
head at the Finance Ministry’s tax administration division.  Taxes will be “gradually” imposed on property owned by
individuals, the report said, citing Zhou.  The country will also expand its resource tax reform to the
whole nation in the five years, the report said, citing Zhou.
Coal and water will be covered in the resource tax as well, the
report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
