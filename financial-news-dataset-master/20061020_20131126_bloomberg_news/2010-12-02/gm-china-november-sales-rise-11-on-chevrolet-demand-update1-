General Motors Co. , the biggest
overseas automaker in China, said sales increased 11 percent in
the country last month as it sold more Buick and Chevrolet cars.  The company and its Chinese joint ventures sold 196,990
vehicles last month, Detroit-based GM said in an e-mailed
statement today. The pace of sales growth slowed from the 19.6
percent increase reported in October.  GM, which raised $23.1 billion in an initial public
offering last month, has said sales in the world’s largest auto
market may reach 2.3 million units this year and rise as much as
15 percent in 2011 as demand grows in the fastest-growing major
economy. China is already the automaker’s largest market by unit
sales and its alliance with SAIC Motor Corp. has a leading 13
percent share.  GM’s passenger-car venture with  SAIC Motor , which makes
Buick Excelle and Chevrolet Cruze cars, increased sales by 33
percent to 105,097 units last month on strong demand for Cruze
sedans and New Sail small cars, according to the statement.
SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co., a mini-vehicle maker in which GM
plans to increase its stake to 44 percent from 34 percent, sold
84,879 mini vehicles in China in November, GM said, without
providing a comparison.  In the first 11 months of 2010, GM’s China sales jumped 33
percent to 2.17 million units, with the company becoming the
first overseas automaker to sell more than 2 million vehicles in
the country in a year, according to the statement.  -- Liza Lin ,  Tian Ying . Editors:  Ian Rowley ,  Garry Smith .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
