The New York Yankees are willing to
increase the value of their three-year, $45 million offer to
free agent  Derek Jeter , ESPN said.  The Yankees today informed Jeter’s agent,  Casey Close , of
their willingness to raise the offer,  ESPN said , citing a
baseball official with knowledge of the exchange. The official
didn’t say whether the Yankees made a new offer.  The conversation was the first since Jeter met with team
officials for several hours in Tampa, Florida, two days ago.  Jeter, 36, an 11-time All-Star and the Yankees’ captain,
batted .270 with a .340 on-base percentage in 2010, both the
lowest in a season since he became a full-time player in 1996.
His 10-year, $189 million contract expired after the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
