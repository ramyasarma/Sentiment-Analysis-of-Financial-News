Britain’s first gas-fired power-
station that captures 90 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions
is to be built by Powerfuel Plc, a mining and energy company,
and Calix Ltd., an Australian cement manufacturer, the Financial
Times reported.  The 10-megawatt demonstration plant, which should be
operating within 12 months, will be located near Doncaster,
northern England, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
