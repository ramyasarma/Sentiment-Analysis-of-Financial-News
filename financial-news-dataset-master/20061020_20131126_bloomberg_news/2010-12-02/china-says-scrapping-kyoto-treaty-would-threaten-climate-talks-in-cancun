China said that scrapping the 1997
Kyoto protocol on global warming would threaten chances for an
agreement to curtail climate change at a United Nations meeting
in Cancun, Mexico this week and next.  “The Kyoto Protocol is the very basis of the framework to
address climate change through international cooperation and
it’s the indispensable pillar of the system,” China’s lead
negotiator, Su Wei, told reporters in the Mexican resort. “If
the pillar is collapsed, you can guess the consequences.”  The comments follow remarks from the head of the Japanese
delegation yesterday that he wouldn’t agree to extend the
agreement, which mandated greenhouse gas emissions reductions
through 2012. Failing to extend the cuts would hurt trading
worth $2.7 billion in carbon emissions credits linked to the UN-
sponsored treaty.  Earlier today, the UN’s lead diplomat organizing the talks
ruled out an agreement on extending Kyoto at this year’s talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
