Wheat rose to a three-week high in
Chicago on speculation that excessive rainfall in Australia will
curb production and dry weather in the U.S. southern Great
Plains may hurt newly planted crops.  More than half of the crop in Australia’s Queensland state
may deteriorate to feed grade following heavy rains, tightening
supplies of grain used to make food. Dry weather in parts of
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the largest U.S. growers of winter
wheat, may deplete soil moisture and limit output. Futures
jumped 7.2 percent yesterday, the most in seven weeks.  “There’s so many fundamentals related to weather, it has
to support the market at least until the end of the year,” said
 Jonathan Bouchet , an analyst at OTCex Group in Geneva. “Wheat
is one of the leading commodities as an investment today.
Overall, commodities are quite bullish.”  Wheat for March delivery advanced 6 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $7.46 a bushel at 10:58 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain reached $7.5175, the highest level since
Nov. 11, and is up 7.5 percent in the past month. The U.S. is
the world’s biggest wheat exporter.  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris climbed 1.4 percent to 232.25 euros ($306.22) a metric
ton. The price has gained 10 percent since Nov. 22, the last
time futures declined.  Corn for March delivery fell 3.25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$5.63 a bushel in Chicago, and soybeans for January delivery
declined 5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $12.78 a bushel. Rice for
January delivery added 3 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $14.405 per
100 pounds, the fourth straight gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
