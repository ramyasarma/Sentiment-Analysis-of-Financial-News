Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said his government will extend by seven months until
Oct. 31 a deadline for stimulus funding for infrastructure
projects.  “This will allow sufficient time for the completion of the
remaining projects,” Harper said today in Mississauga, Ontario,
near Toronto.  Opposition groups, including the New Democratic Party and
the Bloc Quebecois, have called on the government to extend the
deadline for public-works spending.  Economic growth  decreased to the slowest pace in a year
during the third quarter to an annualized rate of 1 percent.
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , who said in October Canadian
deficits will total C$165.2 billion ($164.5 billion) over the
2009-2014 period, had said repeatedly he would be reasonable in
enforcing the original deadline.  The Parliamentary Budget Officer said in a  report  this week
that 24 percent of projects funded under the Infrastructure
Stimulus Fund won’t be completed by March 31, meaning that C$303
million of federal funding wouldn’t take place.  Flaherty said last month next year’s budget won’t contain
new spending measures. He implemented a C$47 billion stimulus
package in his 2009 budget.  To contact the reporters on this story:
