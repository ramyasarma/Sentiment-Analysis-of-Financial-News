Sasol Ltd. , the biggest producer of
motor fuels made from coal, lowered its annual output estimate
by 1.4 percent because of delays in the re-commissioning of its
Secunda plant after a maintenance shutdown.  The revised figure of 7.2 million metric tons is a “more
realistic full-year target,” Sasol said in a statement released
on Johannesburg’s bourse today.  Synthetic-fuel  output was 1.7 million tons in the first
quarter through September, “in line” with expectations, the
Johannesburg-based company said. Output at its Oryx gas-to-
liquids plant in Qatar averaged 27,000 barrels a day, it said.
First-quarter sales were “slightly higher” than the quarterly
average in the second half of last year, it said.  “This is largely attributed to higher product prices and
production improvements,” Sasol said, with stronger prices
countering the negative effect of gains in the rand.  The rand averaged 7.17 against the dollar in the current
financial year so far, compared with 7.65 in Sasol’s first half
a year earlier. Crude oil has averaged $79.07 a barrel in New
York trading, up from $72.17. Sasol posted first-half net income
of 6.3 billion rand ($905 million) a year ago.  Sasol rose for a second day, adding 0.9 percent to 321.99
rand by the 5 p.m. close of trade in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
