Toronto-Dominion Bank , Canada’s
second-largest bank, doesn’t plan to give specific guidance
today on the impact of new capital requirements, Chief Executive
Officer  Edmund Clark  said.  “I know for us, there are several items outstanding that
are of significant value,” Clark said today in a telephone
interview. “What we are saying is, ‘even if you took the most
conservative end of that, we’ll have no trouble meeting those
rules.’”  Clark added that Toronto-Dominion will not need to raise
capital to meet the requirements.  Banks have until 2019 to meet an overhaul of bank
regulation drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. National Bank of Canada told investors this week it
expects to meet that target by the end of 2012, and that it
expects a 250 basis point to 275 basis point reduction on its
capital ratios as it makes the transition.  “I worry a little bit that the industry is getting a
little bit ahead of itself into an arms race,” said Clark, 63.
“The arms race is going to try to cause every one of us to
carry way more capital than the internationally agreed-on Basel
agreement.”  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief Risk Officer  Tom Woods  told investors today the bank expects to have its capital
ratios “comfortable above” the 2019 minimums by Nov. 1, 2012.  Clark is scheduled to speak later today on an earnings
conference call. The Toronto-based lender said today that net
income for the period ended Oct. 31 dropped 1.6 percent to C$994
million ($990 million), or C$1.07 a share.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. local
time to discuss results. To listen, dial +1-416-644-3414 or +1-
