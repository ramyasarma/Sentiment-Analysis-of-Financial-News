What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on speculation that demand for
U.S. supplies will increase as rains damage crops in Australia,
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines, Iowa.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT amid speculation that the debt crisis in Europe will
spread, damping the global economy and demand for U.S. crops,
Roose said. Soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower per
2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open down 0.15 cent
to 0.25 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 4 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago on speculation that demand will ease after
yesterday’s 4.1 percent rally, Roose said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
