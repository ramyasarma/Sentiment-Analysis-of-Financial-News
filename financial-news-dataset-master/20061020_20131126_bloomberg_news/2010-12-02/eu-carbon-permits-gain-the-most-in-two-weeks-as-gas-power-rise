European Union carbon allowances for
December fell to the lowest price in two weeks as German power
erased earlier gains, damping demand for emission permits.  EU allowances for December lost 1.1 percent to 14.67 euros
($19.37) as of 6 p.m. in London on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange. That’s the lowest price since Nov. 16.  German baseload power for next year, a European benchmark,
declined 0.1 percent to 49.90 euros a megawatt-hour, according
to broker prices on Bloomberg. The contract earlier traded as
high as 50.30 euros. Carbon permits are linked to power prices
because utilities often buy emissions allowances when they sell
electricity forward.  To contact the reporters on this story:
