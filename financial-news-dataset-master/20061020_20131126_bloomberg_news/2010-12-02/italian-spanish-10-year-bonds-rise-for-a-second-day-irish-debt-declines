Spanish and Italian 10-year
government bonds rose a second day, reducing the additional
yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
benchmark German bunds. Irish bonds declined.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds fell four basis points
to 5.30 percent as of 8:24 a.m. in London, narrowing the yield
premium over similar-maturity German debt by seven basis points
to 244 basis points. Italian 10-year yields also fell four basis
points, to 4.50 percent.  Irish bonds slid, pushing the yield three basis points
higher to 9.16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
