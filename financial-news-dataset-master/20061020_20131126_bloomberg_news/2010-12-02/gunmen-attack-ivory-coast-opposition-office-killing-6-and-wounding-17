At least six people were killed and
17 were wounded when unidentified “gunmen” entered a party
office of opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara between 10 p.m.
and 11 p.m. last night.  Most people had left the office in Yopougon, a suburb north
of Abidjan, though some youth were present when the attack
happened, Imbassou Ouattara, secretary of the office, said in a
phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
