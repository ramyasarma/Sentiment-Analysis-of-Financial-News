The natural gas market in New York is
contracting as prices head for the first three-year drop on
record, helping to expand trading in heating oil.  Open interest  in gas futures and options has fallen to the
lowest level in more than five years, while  heating oil 
contracts have jumped to the most since at least 1995, according
to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Gas has
tumbled 52 percent since 2007, the most recent year in which the
fuel gained on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Rising gas output is curbing the price swings that traders
seek to boost returns at the same that the prospects of a U.S.
economic rebound are driving fluctuations in heating oil, which
is refined from crude. Production of gas in the U.S.,
intensified by shale drilling, may jump 2.5 percent this year,
according to the Energy Department. Supplies have been at a
 surplus to the five-year average  every week but one since August
2008.  “Natural gas looks like it’s settled into a situation of
structural oversupply,” said Antoine Halff , head of energy
research at New York-based brokerage Newedge USA LLC. “The
perception is that heating oil is a market subject to
significant swings from being oversupplied or undersupplied.”  Gas for January delivery rose 7.4 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to settle at $4.343 per million British thermal units today on
the Nymex. Gas based on the contract closest to expiration
ranged between $3.212 and $6.108 this year. Heating oil gained
4.9 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.4546 a gallon. The front-month
contract fluctuated between $1.8272 and $2.4571 this year.  Declining Interest  Open interest, or the number of contracts or options that
haven’t been closed or delivered, in gas futures and options
fell to 828,690 contracts as of Nov. 23, down 44 percent from
September 2006, according to CFTC data. For heating oil, it was
425,071, close to the 15-year high of 449,980 set on Oct. 5.  Heating oil, a so-called middle distillate of crude, is
advancing amid signs the U.S. economic recovery is gathering
pace, spurring demand for raw materials. Oil will trade at $110
a barrel in 2012, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday.
Morgan Stanley forecasts it will climb to $100 a barrel next
year. It settled at $88 a barrel, a two-year high, on the Nymex
today.  Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded for a 16th straight
month in November, a report yesterday from the Institute for
Supply Management showed. Industrial production also grew in the
U.K. and China, according to separate reports.  Shale Production  “Since 2008, there’s been a view that distillates can be
closely tied to economic growth,” said Halff . “The distillates
market has also become globalized in new ways, whereas the
natural-gas market has been de-globalized because of shale
supplies.”  Production  from shale wells, in fields where rock
formations are fractured and injected with water, sand and
chemicals to release trapped gas, will account for 34 percent of
U.S. output in 2035, doubling from 17 percent in 2008, according
to the Energy Department in Washington. Proven reserves rose in
2009 to the highest level since 1971, the department said in a
report on Nov. 30.  Gas in storage  reached a record 3.843
trillion cubic feet in the week ended Nov. 12.  “When you see the oversupply we have in natural gas and
you see the production levels, you think: what’s going on
here?” said  Mike Rose , the director of energy trading for Angus
Jackson Inc. in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “Producers are still
drilling at a breakneck pace.”  ‘Widowmaker’  Inventories of the fuel in the week ended Nov. 19 were 9.5
percent above the  five-year average , compared with 9.3 percent
the previous week, the Energy Department said on Nov. 24.
Supplies of distillate fuel have dropped 10 percent from a 27-
year high of 176 million barrels reached in August, a department
report showed yesterday.  “Natural gas used to be the widowmaker, where if supply
declined prices could go to $10 or $15,” said  Charlie Katz , a
partner and natural-gas trader with First New York Securities
LLC in New York. “With all the production we have now, people
don’t see that sort of upside potential.”  Gas traded in New York will average $4 a million Btu in
2011, down from a previous forecast of $5.25, Goldman Sachs
analysts led by  Samantha Dart  in London said yesterday. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch said Nov. 23 it sees “downside risks” to
a forecast of $5 for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
