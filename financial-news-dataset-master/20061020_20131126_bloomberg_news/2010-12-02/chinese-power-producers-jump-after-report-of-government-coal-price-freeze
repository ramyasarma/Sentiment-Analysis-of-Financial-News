Chinese power producers including
 Huaneng Power International Inc.  rallied in Hong Kong after the
state-run Xinhua News Agency said the government ordered a
freeze in 2011 contract prices for coal used in power stations.  Huaneng, China’s largest electricity producer, rose as much
as 5.1 percent to HK$4.35 and was trading at HK$4.32 at 10:36
a.m. local time.  Datang International Power Generation Co. , the
second biggest producer, gained 4.3 percent to HK$2.92. The
benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 1.3 percent.  Power-station coal prices under term contracts must be
unchanged from 2010 levels, Xinhua reported yesterday, citing
 Cao Changqing , head of pricing at the National Development and
Reform Commission. “Any form of price increase is not
allowed,” Cao was quoted as saying.  “We believe this is positive for the power producers as
the industry has been suffering from rising coal prices”
without an increase in electricity prices in 2010,  Dave Dai , a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Markets Co., said by
e-mail. “The cap on contracts may to some extent mitigate the
companies from further earnings decline.”  China Huaneng Group Corp., the parent of Huaneng Power, and
other Chinese power producers are running at losses of at least
50 percent this year because of rising coal prices, China Daily
reported, citing Xue Jing, director of the statistics department
of the China Electricity Council.  China Shenhua Energy Co. , the nation’s biggest coal
producer, fell 1.4 percent to HK$32.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
