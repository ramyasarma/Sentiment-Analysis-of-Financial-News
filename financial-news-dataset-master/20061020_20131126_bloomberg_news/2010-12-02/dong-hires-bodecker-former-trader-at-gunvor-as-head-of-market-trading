Dong Energy A/S hired a former
executive at Gunvor International as head of market trading to
develop and improve trading results at Denmark’s biggest power
generator.  Fredrik Bodecker , 42, started yesterday at Dong Energy,
company spokesman  Andreas Krog  said today by phone. The
company’s trading department is based in Hoersholm, north of
Copenhagen.  Bodecker, who has bought and sold energy for more than 15
years, was hired to “improve our competency and develop our
trading,” Henrik Valgma, Dong’s head of portfolio management
and trading, said in an interview. “We want to get even better
at it,”  Bodecker, who reports to Valgma, was head of Nordic power
at Gunvor in Geneva and also worked at RWE AG’s Essent
International unit in the same city after founding Nordic
Commodity Funds AB and leaving in May 2009.  In a year when there was less volatility in energy markets
than normal, Dong’s trading department has “done well, and
better than expected,” in oil and natural gas, Valgma said.  The next-year power contract in Germany, Europe’s biggest
market, traded between 45.05 euros and 55.50 euros so far this
year, compared with a range of 41.60 euros to 59.50 euros in
2009.  As head of market trading, Bodecker will be responsible for
a team of 35 traders buying and selling standard commodity
products for electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and emissions,
with the main focus on northwest Europe. Dong bought and sold
 110 terawatt-hours of electricity  last year, more than three
times Denmark’s annual demand of 34 terawatt hours, it said on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
