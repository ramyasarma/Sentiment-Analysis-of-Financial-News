             Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s largest dairy exporter, quit its U.K. venture with Arla
Foods AmbA as part of a strategy to reduce debt and focus its
consumer sales in Asia, Australia,  New Zealand , the  Middle East 
and  Latin America .  
 The 25 percent stake was not a core investment and its sale
to Viby, Denmark-based Arla will have little impact on the
group’s operations, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Mason said
in a statement today. The venture was Fonterra’s only consumer
unit in  Europe  and no price was disclosed on its sale. The stake
was valued at NZ$67 million ($49 million) as of July 31,
according to Fonterra’s annual report.  
 Fonterra is selling surplus assets to reduce debt and free
up funds for investment in its New Zealand plants, and for
development of new ingredients and consumer products. In April,
it quit an eight-year old venture with Indian cookie-maker
Britannia Industries Ltd. and sold its Western  Australia  ice-cream interests to Nestle SA and Bulla Dairy Foods.  
 The Arla venture was agreed in 2001 to help the partners
sell butter, spreads and cream in the U.K. in competition with
Unilever Plc. It started with about 15 percent of the market by
volume and annual sales of about $280 million, Fonterra said at
the time.  
 Fonterra will continue to license its Anchor brand to Arla
and supply butter to the U.K., Mason said today.
