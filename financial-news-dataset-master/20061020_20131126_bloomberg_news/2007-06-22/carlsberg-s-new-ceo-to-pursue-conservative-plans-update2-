             Carlsberg A/S (CARLB) 's new chief executive
officer will pursue ``conservative'' expansion plans after Nils Smedegaard Andersen leaves, the company's chairman said today,
cooling speculation of a merger with Scottish & Newcastle Plc.  
 Andersen, a 48-year-old Dane, will leave the Nordic region's
largest brewer by the middle of November to become CEO of
shipping company A.P. Moeller-Maersk, Valby, Denmark-based
Carlsberg said today. He has worked at the company for more than
two decades.  
 ``I expect we will be quite conservative in plans and
strategy,'' Chairman Povl Krogsgaard-Larsen said today in a
telephone interview. ``If you want to put it into figures,
possibly 80 percent conservative, 20 percent new aspects.''  
 Andersen's resignation means Carlsberg probably won't merge
with Scottish & Newcastle any time soon, Merrill Lynch & Co.
analysts said today. Carlsberg shares have risen 17 percent this
year on speculation about a combination with the U.K. company,
its partner in a unit that controls  Russia 's largest brewer.  
 ``The resignation of the Carlsberg CEO probably highlights
that the acquisition of Scottish & Newcastle by Carlsberg is not
imminent,'' Merrill Lynch analysts including  David Tovar  said in
a note. ``The business case for such an acquisition remains
attractive, and the combination continues to seem inevitable.''  
 `Sweet Moment'  
 Carlsberg  shares  fell 6 kronor, or 0.9 percent, to 655
kronor in Copenhagen today in London. Scottish & Newcastle's
 stock  dropped 1.7 percent to 636 pence.  
 Andersen is leaving as expansion into regions such as  Asia 
and eastern Europe boosts revenue at the Danish company, which
brewed its first beer in 1847.  
 ``He's giving up a sweet moment at Carlsberg right now, with
earnings growing by 50 percent and a potential big deal in the
next two to three years,'' said Javier Gonzalez-Lastra, an
analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in  London . ``The market believes it
will be with Scottish & Newcastle.''  
 Andersen has said Carlsberg isn't planning to combine with
Edinburgh-based Scottish & Newcastle, though it would be
interested if the U.K. company wanted to sell its stake in the
Russian venture. Krogsgaard-Larsen declined to comment on the
speculation and said ``no specific'' acquisition plans exist at
the moment.  
 Carlsberg is controlled by a 131-year-old foundation set up
to preserve the Danish brewer's independence. Last month, a
charter was amended so the trust can loosen its ownership and
Carlsberg can offer more shares, stoking speculation about a
combination with the British company.  
 `Not Very Happy'  
 ``The change in Carlsberg's charter signaled a more active
role in the consolidation process in the industry,'' said
Vangelis Bratsikas, a  fund manager  at Clariden Bank in Zurich,
which oversees the equivalent of $40 billion, including Carlsberg
stock. A merger would ``make sense,'' he said.  
 The opening of the charter has left Carlsberg with various
opportunities, according to Krogsgaard-Larsen. ``We have no
specific plans at the moment, but a range of possibilities,'' he
said.  
 Carlsberg's departing CEO has a master's degree in economics
from Denmark's University of Aarhus, sits on Maersk's board and
is co-chairman of the EU-Russia Industrialists' Round Table. The
company has spent at least $4.5 billion on acquisitions under his
leadership, according to Bloomberg data.  
 ``We are not very happy to say goodbye to Nils,''
Krogsgaard-Larsen said. ``But we are left in a positive
situation. We have a strong and competent leadership structure. I
think in about four months, we can begin to see the shape of a
new CEO.''  
 `Skillful Manager'  
 Andersen ``is a very skillful manager,'' Jens H. Thomsen, an
analyst at Jyske Bank A/S, said of Andersen. ``He has been able
to implement a new strategy at Carlsberg and to make things
happen. That will be the same at Moeller.''  
 Joergen Buhl Rasmussen, an executive vice president at
Carlsberg, may be an internal candidate to succeed Andersen,
according to Thomsen. ``He was at Gillette before, and he's used
to fast-moving  consumer goods ,'' the analyst said.  
 Andersen's departure won't have much effect on Carlsberg's
strategy, Gonzalez-Lastra said. ``There are other members within
the board that have been very involved in recent decisions in
terms of the strategic direction of the company,'' he said.  
 Though Andersen is ``very much a Carlsberg person'' and
``loyal,'' he found a ``very attractive'' offer and it was
``important for him to accept it'' at this stage of his career,
Carlsberg's Krogsgaard-Larsen said.
