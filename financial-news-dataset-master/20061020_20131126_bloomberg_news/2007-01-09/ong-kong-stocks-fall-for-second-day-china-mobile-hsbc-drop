             Hong Kong  stocks fell on concern a
three-month rally in China-related shares, which lifted the Hang
Seng Index to a record, more than reflected earnings prospects.
 China  Mobile Ltd. declined.  
 ``A correction is expected in the near term, given that in
the last couple of months we've seen a very sharp up-tick in the
market,'' said Teresa Chow, who helps manage $500 million at RBC
Investment Management  Asia  in Hong Kong. ``Some investors would
be inclined to take profits now and buy on the dips.''  
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  fell after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its
rating on the shares amid concern U.S. lending is in decline and
margins at the company's Hong Kong unit are peaking.  
 The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost 131.58, or 0.7 percent, to
19,898.08 in Hong Kong, extending yesterday's 0.9 percent drop.
The measure posted its first two-day decline since Dec. 12-13.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the so-called
H shares of 37 mainland companies, lost 1.3 percent to 9967.48.  
 Stocks tied to China have benefited from the nation's 10
percent economic growth rate, the appreciating  yuan  and
speculation more companies will sell shares on the mainland.  
 Earnings at seven of the Hang Seng's 10 best-performing
stocks in the past three months were related to China. The index
in that time has gained 13 percent, while the H-share measure
climbed 42 percent.  
 Too Far, Too Fast  
 Half of the Hang Seng Index's 36 members declined, while the
rest advanced. January futures dropped 0.5 percent to 19,929.  
 China Mobile (941) , the world's largest cell-phone operator by
users, fell HK$1.40, or 2.1 percent, to HK$66.45, cutting its
three-month gain to 18 percent.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ,
the nation's fourth-largest lender, slid 17 cents, or 3.5 percent,
to HK$4.72. It's risen 37 percent in the same period.  
 China Life Insurance Co., China's biggest insurer, slumped
HK$1.25, or 4.7 percent, to HK$25.60. The stock, which climbed as
much as 82 percent in the past three months, was the  biggest drag 
on the H-share index.  
 The shares had benefited from speculation that the company's
mainland listing would trade at a premium to the Hong Kong stock.
China Life's  yuan-denominated shares  more than doubled in its
first day of trading in  Shanghai  today.  
 ``The positive impact of the listing of China Life's A
shares has already been reflected in the market,'' said Conita Hung, head of research for Delta Asia Securities Ltd. ``H shares
have run up too quickly since December, and they are undergoing
some consolidation.''  
 Buying Laggards  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101) , Hong Kong's fourth-largest
developer, climbed 72 cents, or 3.9 percent, to HK$19.08 as some
investors sought shares that had underperformed the broader
market. The stock had lost 7.9 percent in the week through
yesterday, more than the Hang Seng's 1.4 percent drop.  
 `` Hang Lung  Properties is lagging behind the market,'' said
Delta Asia's Hung. ``Apart from that, investors are optimistic
about its property projects in mainland China.'' Hang Lung plans
to invest as much as HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion) to build 12
commercial properties in China.  
 HSBC (5) , the Hang Seng's largest constituent, fell 70 cents, or
0.5 percent, to HK$141.50. Analysts at JPMorgan cut the London-
based bank's shares to ``neutral'' from ``overweight'' and
lowered their earnings estimates by 3 percent for 2006, 7.5
percent for 2007 and by 5 percent for 2008.  
 ``There will be more selling in the short term because of
the downgrading of HSBC,'' said  Andrew Sullivan , head of Asian
sales trading at Daiwa Securities SMBC Co. in Hong Kong. Loan
growth at HSBC ``depends on the U.S. performance.''  
 CLSA Ltd. also trimmed its target price and earnings
estimates, according to a Jan. 5 report.
