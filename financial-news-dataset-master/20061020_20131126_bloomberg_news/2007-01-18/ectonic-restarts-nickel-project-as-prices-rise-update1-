             Tectonic Resources NL, an Australian
mineral exploration company, said it was restarting mining at
its RAV 8 nickel project in Western Australia, as prices of the
metal soared.  
 The project has an initial mine life of three months,
without specifying how much nickel could be produced, the
company said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange.  
 ``The current proposal will look to exploit the better
grade areas around the margins of previously mined areas,'' the
company said. Mining was suspended in September 2005 at RAV 8
because nickel prices then didn't support work, it said.  
 Prices of nickel, used in the making of stainless steel,
reached a record in  London  yesterday on concern a labor dispute
in  Canada  will cut supply. Prices have jumped sixfold since 2002
as stainless steel production expanded.  
 Shares of the company rose 1.2 cents, or 12 percent, to 11
Australian cents, at 10:52 a.m. Sydney time.  
 The mine produced 15,314 metric tons of contained nickel in
five-and-a-half years of life, the company said on its Web-Site.
It produced 1,654 tons for the year ended June 30, 2005, about
half of the previous year's output, according to the Register of
Australian Mining.
