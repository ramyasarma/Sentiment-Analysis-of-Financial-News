Arsenal is set to make a renewed
bid for Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina in the so-called
transfer window in January, the News of the World reported
today, without citing anyone.  The Gunners had a 15 million-pound ($23.7 million) bid for
the 28-year-old rejected by its Premier League soccer rival
during the summer, the newspaper said.  The News of the World said Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia
made several mistakes in his team’s 3-2 home defeat by West
Bromwich Albion yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
