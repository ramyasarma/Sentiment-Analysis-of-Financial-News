Billionaire  Roustam Tariko , the
owner of  Russian Standard  vodka, said he may expand his liquor
distribution business into neighboring countries.  “We may go to some other markets like Ukraine with our
business model,” Tariko, 48, said in a Sept. 23 telephone
interview from Sydney. “But it’s unlikely we will expand
somewhere else.”  Tariko, ranked Russia’s 47th-richest man by Forbes
magazine, said he will consider acquiring rival spirit makers to
bolster growth. In June, Tariko announced plans to buy  Nemiroff ,
a Ukrainian vodka maker, to add lower-priced brands to his
Russian Standard portfolio.  “We have a strong competitive advantage in vodka from
Russia,” Tariko said. “For me to go and enter another
category, like whiskey, or something else would definitely be an
opportunity, but it would be more expensive.”  Russian Standard says it is the country’s biggest producer
of premium vodka, defined as costing more than 200 rubles
($6.46) per 0.75 liter bottle.  The billionaire is reluctant to introduce flavored vodka, a
tactic he says rival  Pernod Ricard SA  has done successfully with
its Absolut brand, as such a product may lack the long-term
growth of traditional sprits.  Tariko had an estimated fortune of $1.4 billion, Forbes
magazine said in April. His Russian Standard Corp. runs a liquor
distribution business, the original source of his wealth, and
owns a  bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
