Collingwood and St. Kilda will
replay yesterday’s Australian Football League grand final on Oct.
2 with a provision for extra time after the teams tied in the
first drawn final since 1977, the AFL said today.  “It is the view of the AFL commission that it is not
appropriate to ask the teams to come back for a third week, to
decide the 2010 Premiership,” AFL Chief Executive Officer
 Andrew Demetriou  said in an e-mailed statement.  Yesterday’s game ended tied at 68-68, and will be replayed
allowing for extra time of 10 minutes, following criticism from
players including Collingwood captain Nick Maxwell. Extra time
will be played in the unlikely event of another draw in the
replay, the league said.  Maxwell told Australia’s Seven Network television the
concept of a replay was “an absolute joke.”  Yesterday’s result was only the third tie in the history of
Australian rules football’s championship game.  The Oct. 2 game will kick off at 2:30 p.m. local time at
the Melbourne Cricket Ground. A crowd of 100,016 watched
yesterday’s game at the stadium.  To contact the reporters on this story:
