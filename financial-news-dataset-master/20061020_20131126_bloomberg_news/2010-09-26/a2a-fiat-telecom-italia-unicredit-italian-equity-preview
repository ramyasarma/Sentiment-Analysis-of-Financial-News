Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index
was little changed, losing less than 0.1 percent to 20,593.94 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Astaldi SpA  (AST IM) rose for the first day in four,
gaining 1.8 percent to 5.26 euros as Italy’s second-biggest
builder signed a new contract in Turkey.  Azimut Holding SpA  (AZM IM) advanced 1.3 percent to 7.17
euros, the stock’s biggest gain in two weeks. Credit Suisse
Group AG initiated coverage of Italy’s largest independent fund
manager with an “outperform” rating. The brokerage cited
Azimut’s 23 percent increase in assets since 2005, compared with
the industry average 24 percent decline in assets.  Benetton Group SpA  (BEN IM) gained 3.7 percent to 5.54
euros as shares of Italy’s biggest clothing retailer rose above
their 20- and 50-day moving averages.  Beni Stabili SpA  (BNS IM) increased 1.1 percent to 66.85
euro cents, a third consecutive gain. The Italian real estate
company controlled by France’s Fonciere des Regions SA was
upgraded to “outperform” from “neutral” at Exane BNP
Paribas, which cited the stock among ‘restructuring stories” in
the industry.  Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA  (CIR IM) rose 1.1 percent
to 1.5 euros, extending a 5.2 percent gain on Sept. 24.
Cheuvreux lifted its price estimate to 1.8 euros from 1.7 euros,
citing the damages that Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s Fininvest SpA may pay to CIR as part of a legal
case involving the 1991 takeover battle for publisher  Arnoldo
Mondadori SpA .  Fondiaria-Sai SpA  (FSA IM) fell 1.8 percent to 7.52 euros,
the steepest decline in more than a month. Chief Executive
Officer Fausto Marchionni said it’s “too soon” to discuss
dividends, Adnkronos newswire reported, citing comments the
executive made to reporters in Turin.  Marchionni was responding to a question about rumors the
company might not pay a dividend for 2010 earnings, Adnkronos
said.  Assicurazioni Generali SpA  (G IM), Italy’s biggest insurer,
dropped 1 percent to 14.77 euros.  Italcementi SpA  (IT IM) increased for a second day, rising
1.8 percent to 6.62 euros. Mediobanca Securities said in a note
that the country’s largest cement maker forecast that group
sales will grow 3.7 percent a year until 2014. The company said
that sales from emerging markets will advance at 6.3 percent a

maker, advanced 3.5 percent to 8.07 euros.  Piaggio & C. SpA  (PIA IM) rose 3.2 percent to 2.37 euros,
snapping a two-day loss. UniCredit Research, which has a “buy”
rating on the scooter company, said in a note that the potential
reintroduction of government scrapping incentives is “positive
for Piaggio shares, although we would not overemphasize the
impact these incentives are likely to ultimately have on Piaggio
accounts.”  Unione di Banche Italiane SCPA  (UBI IM), Italy’s fourth-
largest bank, retreated 1.5 percent to 7.05 euros, erasing gains
on Sept. 24 as banking shares were among the worst performers in
Europe today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
