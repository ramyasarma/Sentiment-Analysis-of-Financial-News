Michael Geoghegan , the outgoing
chief executive officer of  HSBC Holdings Plc , may receive a
severance package of 23 million pounds ($36 million) in salary,
bonuses and shares, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
how it obtained the information.  The payout, accumulated during Geoghegan’s 37 years at the
bank, will be conditional on the company’s performance and may
be lower, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
