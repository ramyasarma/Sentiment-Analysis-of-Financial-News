Daimler AG , the second-largest
maker of luxury vehicles, predicts that the revamped CLS luxury
coupe and cleaner engines will boost sales next year, putting it
on track to reach its target of 1.5 million cars by 2015.  The Mercedes-Benz Cars unit will introduce a version of the
CLS at the Paris Motor Show this week. The restyled four-door
coupe, featuring broader shoulder lines and a prominent three-
pointed star in the center of the grill, will go on sale in
January starting at 63,427 euros ($85,500), said  Joachim Schmidt , executive vice president for sales and marketing.  Surging growth in China and a recovery in the U.S. are
boosting demand for Mercedes vehicles a year after the financial
crisis led to a 14 percent sales decline. The Daimler unit
anticipates clawing back most of that setback in 2010,
forecasting sales to gain at least 10 percent.  “We have an abundance of product innovations that make us
optimistic that we will have a successful 2011,” Schmidt said
in an interview at his office in Stuttgart, Germany.  The new CLS will likely surpass the 170,000 units sold of
the current version over the course of its lifecycle, Schmidt
said. The model was first introduced in 2004.  The restyled coupe, which is available with headlamps
featuring 71 LEDs that simulate natural daylight, shares
engines, transmissions, and other components with the E- and S-
Class models to improve its profitability. “Economically, it’s
a very interesting model,” said Schmidt.  6-Series, A7  The CLS will face more competition in its second
generation.  Volkswagen AG ’s Audi unit will present the A7 in
Paris this week. The four-door coupe will go on sale in Europe
at the end of October for 51,650 euros.  Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG  is planning a four-door version of the 6-Series coupe.  “The drivers next year could very well be a recovery in
Germany, stronger growth in the U.S. and a continuation of
growth in China,” said  Jose Asumendi , an analyst at RBS, who
recommends buying Daimler shares. He predicts a 5 percent
increase in Mercedes sales volumes for 2011.  Mercedes-Benz plans to introduce a revamped version of the
SLK hard-top roadster and an updated C-Class range, which will
be expanded to add a coupe in 2011. Mercedes will roll out
engines featuring a fuel-saving start-stop feature across most
of its lineup and, toward the end of next year, intends to
introduce new versions of the M-Class sport-utility vehicle and
B-Class compact.  ‘Head-to-Head’  Growth will probably continue in the U.S. as demand
gradually recovers from the recession, while China will
challenge the U.S. as Mercedes’ largest market outside Germany
by 2015. “It’ll be a head-to-head race” for the biggest
Mercedes market outside Germany, Schmidt said.  Mercedes U.S. deliveries rose 11 percent to 144,300 cars
and SUVs through the first eight months of 2010, while China
sales more than doubled to 90,400. Worldwide deliveries of
Mercedes vehicles, including the Smart city-car brand, rose 12
percent to 800,200 autos.  Daimler is targeting sales of 300,000 Mercedes-Benz
passenger cars in China by 2015, when it expects to sell at
least 1.5 million Mercedes brand vehicles globally, a 48 percent
increase from 1 million sold last year.  “In 2015, we will have a lot of new cars that have no
predecessor,” Schmidt said in the Sept. 23 interview.  Mercedes plans to double its lineup of small cars to four
models from two and is building a factory in Hungary to add
capacity for the new models.  Daimler, also the world’s largest maker of heavy-duty
trucks, in July increased its  target  for 2010 earnings before
interest and taxes by half to 6 billion euros on stronger
Mercedes profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
