“Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps”
opened as the No. 1 movie in U.S. and Canadian theaters this
past weekend, earning $19 million in ticket sales for  News
Corp. ’s Twentieth Century Fox.  “Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole,” also a
debut film, was second with $16.1 million, box-officer tracker
 Hollywood.com Box-Office  said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Money Never Sleeps,” the  Oliver Stone -directed sequel to
1987’s “Wall Street,” is News Corp.’s first No. 1 film since
“Avatar” opened in December. Twentieth Century Fox ranks first
among Hollywood studios in sales this year with $1.31 billion as
of today, according to the website  Box Office Mojo .  “While (the opening) wasn’t spectacular, for a  Michael Douglas  or Oliver Stone film which don’t usually open very
strong, this is very respectable,” said  Gitesh Pandya , chief
executive officer of BoxOfficeGuru.com.  Douglas reprises his Oscar-winning role as financier Gordon
Gekko, who has just completed a lengthy prison term. The movie
co-stars  Shia LaBeouf , who plays a young trader in a tale set
amid the 2008 economic meltdown.  Time Warner Inc.’s “Guardians of Ga’Hoole” is a 3-D
animated adaptation of Kathryn Lasky’s “Guardians of Ga’Hoole”
series. The movie features the voices of  Jim Sturgess  and  Helen Mirren  in a fantasy adventure about owls.  ‘Easy A’  It was “a respectable opening, inflated some by 3-D ticket
prices, as they are not a huge franchise like ‘Harry Potter’ or
‘Twilight,’” Pandya said.  “The Town,” last weekend’s top film, dropped to third
with $15.6 million for Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros.  Ben Affleck  stars and directs the bank robbery thriller, which also
features  Jon Hamm , Rebecca Hall and  Jeremy Renner .  “Easy A,” dropped to fourth from second, earning $10.6
million for Sony Corp.’s Screen Gems. The teen comedy stars Emma
Stone as a high school student determined to enhance her social
status.  Lisa Kudrow ,  Stanley Tucci  and  Patricia Clarkson  co-
star.  “You Again” opened in fifth place with receipts of $8.4
million for Walt Disney Co.’s Buena Vista. Kristen Bell,
 Sigourney Weaver ,  Jamie Lee Curtis  and  Betty White  lead a
female-dominated cast about high school rivals who reconnect at
a wedding.  ‘The Social Network’  This coming weekend, Sony’s “The Social Network” debuts.
The fictional take on the origin of Facebook stars Jesse
Eisenberg as  Mark Zuckerberg  and  Justin Timberlake  as venture
capitalist  Sean Parker . It will be joined by two horror movies,
Paramount Vantage’s “Case 39” and Overture Films LLC’s “Let
Me In,” as October kicks off the Halloween movie season.  “The Social Network” should “singlehandedly breathe new
life into the box office as its one of those rare films that
pleases every critic and brings out the commercial moviegoers,”
Pandya said.  Weekend sales for the top 12 films rose 9.3 percent to
$90.8 million from $83 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com
said. Year-to-date receipts total $8.07 billion, up 3.9 percent
from $7.77 billion. Attendance has fallen 1.7 percent this year.  The following table has figures provided by studios to Los
