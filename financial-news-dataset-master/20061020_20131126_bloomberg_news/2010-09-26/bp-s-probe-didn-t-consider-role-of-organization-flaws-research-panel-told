BP Plc ’s lead investigator into the
causes of the Deepwater Horizon drilling explosion said his team
didn’t examine whether organizational failings at the oil
company may have contributed to the April blowout.  Mark Bly, BP’s head of safety and operations, told a
panel of the National Academies in Washington today that the
report the company released September 9 on the spill in the Gulf
of Mexico wasn’t meant as the final word on the disaster.  “This doesn’t represent complete penetration into
potentially deeper issues,” Bly said of the BP report, which
placed much of the blame for mistakes that contributed to the
largest U.S. oil spill on rig owner Transocean Ltd. and
contractor Halliburton Co.  Najmedin Meshkati, a civil engineering professor at the
University of Southern California who serves on the National
Acadamies panel investigating the spill, asked BP for more
information on the tasks rig workers were required to perform
and communications between the rig and onshore facilities.  The  National Academies  provide research on science and
technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
