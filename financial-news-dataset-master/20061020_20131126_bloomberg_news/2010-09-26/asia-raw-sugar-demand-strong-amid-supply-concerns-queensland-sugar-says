Demand for raw in Asia remained
“very strong,” Queensland Sugar Ltd. Chief Executive Officer
Neil Taylor said in a statement today.  “The global supply and demand picture remains tight, with
crop forecasts for Thailand, Pakistan and South Africa now lower
and recent heavy rainfall disrupting the Australian harvest,”
he said. “Analysts predict that international demand for sugar
could outstrip supply for up to six months more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
