---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES  New York: U.S. stocks advanced as Walgreen Co. led a rally in
consumer-staples and health companies and investors speculated
the Federal Reserve will buy more debt to safeguard the economy.
*Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, jumped 11 percent
as earnings topped estimates.
*Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson paced gains in health-care
shares as the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal by
pharmaceutical companies seeking to block thousands of public
hospitals from suing over a federal discount-drug program.
*The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent to 1,147.70 at 4 p.m. in New York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 46.10 points, or 0.4
percent, to 10,858.14.  London: European stocks fell as Irish and Portuguese bonds
plunged, fueling concern that the sovereign-debt crisis is
worsening, while a report showed U.S. consumer confidence
declined to the lowest level in seven months.
*The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.2 percent to
262.36 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London.

p.m. close in Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The yen reached the strongest level versus the dollar
since the Bank of Japan intervened to weaken the currency as a
report showed lower-than-forecast U.S. consumer confidence,
boosting demand for refuge assets. The dollar reached a five-
month low against the euro as consumer sentiment dropped,
fueling speculation the Federal Reserve will resume quantitative
easing, or the large-scale purchase of debt, to bolster the
economy.

4:05 p.m. in New York.

compared with the 1.276 percent average forecast in a Bloomberg

percent, to settle at $1,308.30 an ounce at 1:30 p.m.  METALS  New York: Copper prices rose for the fourth time in five
sessions as inventories fell and a weaker U.S. dollar boosted

$3.628 a pound at 11:31 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
*On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose $63
to $7,973 a metric ton ($3.62 a pound).  OIL  New York: Crude oil futures fell as U.S. gasoline demand
declined for the fifth time in six weeks and on speculation
gasoline inventories rose from a six-month high.
*MasterCard Inc. reported that demand slipped 0.2 percent to
8.98 million barrels of fuel a day in the week ended Sept. 24.
*An Energy Department report tomorrow may show gasoline
