An Argentine judge has suspended a
government order forcing Group Clarin SA-owned Internet provider
Fibertel to shut down, Perfil said.   Federal Judge Elvio Bautista Sagarra told Fibertel to
continue guaranteeing service to more than one million clients,
the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported.   The move comes one month after the government ordered
Fibertel to shut down within 90 days, saying that its merger
with Clarin’s cable television unit, Cablevision SA, was
illegal. Cablevision has vowed to fight the government’s action,
which it said is “totalitarian.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
