Unilever Plc is near a deal to
acquire Alberto Culver Co., maker of Alberto VO5 and TRESemme
hair care products, the Wall Street Journal said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Terms of the purchase couldn’t be obtained, the newspaper
said. Alberto Culver, based in the Chicago suburb of Melrose
Park, has a market value of $3.1 billion, the newspaper said.
The company may be valued at as much as $4 billion with a
typical take-over premium of 20 percent to 30 percent, the
Journal reported.  Personal-care products including shampoo and skin products
have been outperforming Unilever’s other units, the Journal
said. A purchase of Alberto Culver would add Nexxus hair styling
products and Noxzema face cream to the Dutch company’s
portfolio, which includes Degree deodorant and Vaseline.  Unilever agreed to buy Sara Lee Corp.’s shower-gel and
European detergents business last year. The deal hasn’t closed
yet because of concerns by the European Union’s antitrust
regulator.  An unidentified Unilever spokesman had no comment and
Alberto Culver couldn’t immediately be reached, the Journal
said.  Alberto Culver rose 18 cents to $31.48 on Sept. 24 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. This year, the stock has
gained 7.5 percent, compared with a 14 percent increase in the
Standard and Poor’s Midcap Consumer Staples Index.  Unilever, based in Rotterdam, rose 5 cents to 21.85 euros in
Amsterdam trading on Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
