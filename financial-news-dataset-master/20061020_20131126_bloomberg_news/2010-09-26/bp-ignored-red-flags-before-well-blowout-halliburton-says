A  Halliburton Co.  executive
disputed BP Plc’s allegation that the company’s cement job let
oil and gas flow up to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig,
contributing to the blowout in the Gulf of Mexico.  Thomas Roth, vice president of cementing for Houston-based
Halliburton, said today that BP’s well design was to blame for
the explosion that led to the biggest U.S. oil spill.  BP workers ignored “multiple red flags” indicating
the well wasn’t sealed properly and hydrocarbons could escape,
Roth said at a National Academies hearing in Washington
investigating the cause of the April 20 spill. BP officials
earlier told the panel that a faulty cement recipe failed to
keep gas and oil from escaping to the surface.  To contact the reporter on this story:
