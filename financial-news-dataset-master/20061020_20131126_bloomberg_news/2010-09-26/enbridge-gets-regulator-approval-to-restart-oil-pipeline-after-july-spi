Enbridge Energy Partners LP  may
resume oil flow on a pipeline in Michigan tomorrow after
receiving final approval from U.S. regulators today to proceed
following a rupture and spill July 26.  “We are preparing to resume service” tomorrow, Terri
Larson, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “Enbridge has
now received final approval from PHMSA for the restart of Line
6B.”  The company’s plan “is approved to commence no earlier
than the morning of Monday, September 27,” David Barrett, a
director at the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety
Administration said in a  letter today  to Enbridge.  The pipeline was shut after it ruptured, spilling about
19,500 barrels of oil near Marshall, Michigan. The closure
reduced heavy crude supplies for refineries in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and Ontario. BP Plc and United Refining Co. were
forced to pare production after the pipeline was shut.  Enbridge said in a  Sept. 24 letter  to PHMSA that the
company notified Kalamazoo River/Enbridge Oil Spill Response
Unified Command of its intent to restart the pipeline tomorrow.
The company said it is “in a position to return Line 6B to
service the morning of Monday, Sept. 27.”  Line 6B is a  30-inch pipeline , which has a capacity of
290,000 barrels a day without storage constraints, and
transports heavy crude oil from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia,
Ontario, according to Enbridge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
