Chinese customs are tightening
inspections of shipments to and from Japan causing delays for
car parts and machinery deliveries, the Asahi newspaper
reported, without citing anyone.      Customs officials in Beijing have required all air cargo to
be opened and examined since Sept. 25, the report said.   The measures may be in response to Japan’s arrest this
month of a Chinese skipper over a ship collision near disputed
islands, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
