OAO Lukoil , Russia’s largest oil
producer not controlled by the state, together with a group of
investors bought almost 5 percent of Lukoil’s shares from
ConocoPhillips for $2.4 billion, the Moscow-based company said.  Lukoil and the investor group bought 42.5 million shares in
the form of American depositary receipts at a price of $56 each.
The purchase, arranged by  UniCredit Bank AG , was for less than
half of an 11.6 percent holding that ConocoPhillips had made
available under an option that expired yesterday, Lukoil said in
an e-mailed statement.  The deal aims at enhancing the company’s attractiveness to
investors. “It allows us to support our share prices, since the
transaction is funded by the group’s internal resources, without
increasing the company’s total debt,” Lukoil Vice President
 Leonid Fedun  said in the statement today.  Alexei Kokin, an oil and gas analyst at UralSib Financial
Corp. in Moscow, agreed that Lukoil’s share price stands to
benefit. “There is less negative sentiment for the average
investor, as the amount of shares hanging over the market is
less than we thought it would be,” he said by telephone today.  ConocoPhillips, with headquarters in Houston, is selling
down its stake in Lukoil to raise money to repay debt and buy
back its own shares.  A Lukoil spokesman said he could not immediately specify
the amount of stock bought by each investor in the UniCredit-led
group. The spokesman declined to be identified, citing company
policy.  Lukoil on Aug. 16 bought 7.6 percent of its stock from
ConocoPhillips for $3.44 billion. Standard & Poor’s said in July
that Lukoil could threaten its credit rating were it to buy all
of its shares then held by  ConocoPhillips .  Lukoil closed at $58.76 a share in New York on Sept. 24, up
4.2 percent for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
