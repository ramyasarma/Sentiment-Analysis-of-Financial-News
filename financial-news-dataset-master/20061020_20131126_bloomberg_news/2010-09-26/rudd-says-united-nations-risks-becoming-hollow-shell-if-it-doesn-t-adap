Australian Foreign Affairs Minister
 Kevin Rudd  said the United Nations risks becoming a “hollow
shell” if it doesn’t reshape its institutions, with nations
increasingly seeking to sidestep the UN.  Countries need to make the UN’s institutions work and
become effective for global governance, Rudd, who was ousted as
prime minister in June, told the  UN. ’s General Assembly
yesterday.  The UN’s role had changed from the time of its
establishment in the “grim” aftermath of World War II, and the
body needed to remain effective in a world that has become both
“multipolar,” as more emerging powers introduce competing
interests, and more interconnected, he said.  “Two-thirds of a century after our formation, we, the
United Nations, now face increasingly complex global challenges
in an increasingly fragmented world and a much more contested
international space,” Rudd said.  While globalization had improved the lives of many, the
increase in global communication and the movement of people had
created a new set of issues the UN needs to address, including
pandemic diseases, international organized crime and the threat
of terrorism, and climate change, Rudd said.  “These new global realities create an imperative for
responsive, representative and, most critically, effective
systems of global governance,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
