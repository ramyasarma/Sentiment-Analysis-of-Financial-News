Asian  stocks  gained, driving the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index to a five-month high, as a bigger-than-
estimated increase in U.S. capital-goods orders bolstered
optimism exports to the world’s largest economy will rise.  Komatsu Ltd. , the world’s No. 2 maker of construction
equipment, jumped 3.2 percent in Tokyo, while  Canon Inc. , which
gets 28 percent of its sales in the Americas, advanced 2.5
percent.  Korea Zinc Co.  surged 5.4 percent in Seoul, on higher
metal prices. Television Broadcasts Ltd., Hong Kong’s biggest

sought a stake in the company.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 1.2 percent to 127.04
as of 7:36 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest level since April 27, as
the U.S. capital-goods report fueled expectations a global
economic recovery will strengthen. The gauge has climbed 9
percent this month, putting it on course for its biggest monthly
advance since May 2009 and the steepest quarterly gain in a year.  “Rising capital investments in the U.S. is a positive sign
that shows companies expect demand to increase in the next few
months,” said  Ng Soo Nam , Singapore-based chief investment
officer at Nikko Asset Management Co., which has $123 billion in
assets globally. “The stock rally may continue given that
valuations are fair, but we have to watch whether the
improvements in economic data are sustainable.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 1.4 percent. The
government is considering a stimulus package worth as much as
4.6 trillion yen ($54.6 billion), a government official said.  Capital Goods  China’s Shanghai Composite Index and Australia’s  S&P/ASX

changed. The index surged 2.1 percent on Sept. 24 to the highest
level since May 13 following the capital-goods report and

August from a 5.3 percent decline in July, figures from the
Commerce Department showed on Sept. 24 in Washington. The median
forecasts of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for an
increase of 3 percent.  “It’s positive for the whole global economy that demand
for capital investment in the private sector is strong,” said
 Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co.
in Tokyo. “Demand should rise further. Capital investment is
still at 80 percent of the peak.”  Metals Prices  Komatsu rose 3.2 percent to 1,935 yen in Tokyo and Canon
advanced 2.5 percent to 3,890 yen.  Honda Motor Co. , which

from this year’s high on April 15 to its 2010 low on May 25 amid
concern Europe’s debt crisis and Chinese steps to curb property-
price inflation will derail global growth. The gauge has since
climbed 17 percent, including a 13 percent rally since June 30
that has put the index on course for its biggest  quarterly
advance  in a year.  Stocks have rallied as U.S. and Chinese economic reports
buoyed confidence in the global economy, while Japanese
intervention to weaken the yen boosted the outlook for companies
reliant on overseas revenue. Government figures today showed a
deeper slowdown than forecast in Japan’s exports,  The stimulus package that Japan is considering will be
funded by tax revenue and left over funds from the 2009 budget,
a government official said on condition of anonymity.  Estimated Earnings  The Asian benchmark increased 4.2 percent in 2010 through
last week, compared with gains of 3 percent by the  S&P 500  and 4

agreement has been reached, Bonnie Ngan, the spokeswoman, said.
The Apple Daily reported on Sept. 25 that Lee’s billionaire
father may pay about HK$9 billion ($1.16 billion) for a majority
stake in TVB. Henderson Investment Ltd., of which the senior Lee
is chairman, climbed 25 percent to 90 Hong Kong cents.  Also in Hong Kong,  Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd.  gained
9.1 percent to HK3.59 and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. climbed
3.1 percent to HK$12.16. The companies were rated “overweight”
in new coverage by JPMorgan Chase & Co., which said they’re
proxies for the “strong secular growth” of China’s passenger
vehicle industry.  Improving Margins  In Wellington,  Hallenstein Glasson Holdings Ltd.  rose 2.9
percent to NZ$4.24 after the New Zealand-based clothing retailer
said full-year profit surged 53 percent on improving margins.  Japanese consumer lenders slumped today after the Nikkei
