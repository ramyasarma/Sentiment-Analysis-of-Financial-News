Ireland’s government will seek
talks with holders of 4 billion euros worth of senior debt in
Anglo Irish Bank Corp, the Sunday Times said, without citing
anyone. The government may seek to buy back the debt at a
discount or offer to swap the debt for equity in a new asset
recovery bank being created by a split of the lender, the
newspaper said.  The government, which took over the lender in 2009, may
also seek to buy back back 2.4 billion euros of Anglo Irish
subordinated debt at a discount of as much as 90 percent, the
paper said. The debt was issued before the government’s two-year
guarantee was introduced in 2008.  A spokesman for the Finance
Ministry didn’t immediately return a call to his cell phone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
