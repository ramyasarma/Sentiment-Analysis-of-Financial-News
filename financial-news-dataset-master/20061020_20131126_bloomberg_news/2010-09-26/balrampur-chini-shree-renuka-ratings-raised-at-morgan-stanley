Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd. and
Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. were raised to “overweight” from
“underweight” at Morgan Stanley, which also upgraded its view
on the Indian sugar industry to “attrative” from “cautious.”  The brokerage raised its share-price estimate for Balrampur
Chini to 129 rupees from 57 rupees and increased its forecast
for Shree Renuka’s shares to 109 rupees from 43 rupees,
according to a report by Nillai Shah and Girish Achhipalia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
