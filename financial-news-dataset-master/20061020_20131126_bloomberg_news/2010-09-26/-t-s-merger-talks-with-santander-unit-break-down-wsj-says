M&T Bank Corp.  may have abandoned
merger talks with Sovereign Bank, a U.S. unit of Banca Santander
SA, the Wall Street journal reported, citing people familiar
with the negotiations.  The talks are “dead” because Santander officials are
reluctant to agree that the merged lender be run by M&T Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Wilmers , the people said, according to
the newspaper. A compromise plan under which Santander would
have received a majority stake in the combined bank in exchange
for Wilmers getting management control was rejected, the Journal
said.  A spokesman for Santander in Madrid declined to comment on
the report to Bloomberg News today. Michael Zabel, a spokesman
for M&T in Buffalo, New York, also declined to comment.   To contact the reporters on this story:
