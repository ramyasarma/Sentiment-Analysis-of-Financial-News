Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said
it has acquired a controlling stake in Norway’s Visma AS from
HgCapital.  “The company has a very bright future and we are excited
about the prospect of working with HgCapital and its management
team to support Visma through the next stage of its
development,” Mati Szeszkowski, KKR director, said in an e-
mailed statement.  HgCapital Chief Executive Officer Nic Humphries said it
will retain almost 40 percent of its original stake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
