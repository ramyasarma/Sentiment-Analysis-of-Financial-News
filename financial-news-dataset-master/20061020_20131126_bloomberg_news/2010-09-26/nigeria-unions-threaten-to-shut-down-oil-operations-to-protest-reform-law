Nigeria‘s oil industry unions
threatened to shut down all petroleum operations in the country,
accusing the parliament of carrying out a “selective
legislative process,” creating a Petroleum Industry Bill that
benefits global oil companies.  The bill has been framed “to essentially favor the
interest of the international oil corporations,” Nigeria’s
white-collar Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association
and the blue-collar National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas
workers said in an e-mailed statement today.  The two unions will shut down all operations in the
industry “if the government goes ahead with the plan to pass
the Petroleum Industry Bill into law as it is,” the statement
said.  The petroleum and gas industry bill, currently before the
legislature, seeks to reform the way the industry is operated
and funded in Africa’s leading oil-producing nation. Protests by
the unions have often led to shortages of petroleum products in
the continent’s most-populous nation.  The unions want to hold talks “as a matter of utmost
urgency” with Parliament’s joint committee on petroleum and the
oil minister, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Elisha Bala-Gbogbo  in Abuja via Johannesburg at
