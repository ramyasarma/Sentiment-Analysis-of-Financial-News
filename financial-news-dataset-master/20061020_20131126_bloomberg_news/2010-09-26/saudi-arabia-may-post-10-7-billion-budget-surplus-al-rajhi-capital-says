Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s
biggest economy, may report a 40 billion-riyal ($10.7 billion)
budget surplus this year, compared with a budget deficit of 70
billion riyals last year, according to Al-Rajhi Capital.  The Saudi “economy has gained traction,” the Riyadh-based
unit of Al-Rajhi Bank said in its  September economic report 
received yesterday by e-mail. “Non-oil export growth has been
robust.”  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil supplier, announced
in late 2008 a $400 billion, five-year spending package to
strengthen the economy and help finance infrastructure projects.
The non-oil private sector economy will increase 4.4 percent
this year, according to  Al-Rajhi Capital .  “On the back of rising crude production, we expect the oil
sector to grow at 2.5 percent this year against 6.7 percent
contraction last year,” the company said in the report.  Saudi inflation will “moderate” to 5.5 percent by the end
of the year, according to the al-Rajhi report. Saudi inflation
accelerated for a seventh month to reach 6.1 percent in August,
the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Sept. 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
