Macarthur Coal Ltd. , the world’s
largest producer of pulverized coal, said it would pay about 1
to 2 percent more tax under Australia’s revised proposed levy on
mining profits.  “It depends on the price of coal, but it’ll go up another
1 or 2 percent,”  Keith de Lacy , chairman of the Brisbane-based
company, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.’s Inside
Business program today.  Mining companies in July reached an agreement with Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard  on a new minerals resources rent tax,
which included concessions they had sought. This ended a dispute
that cost her predecessor  Kevin Rudd  his job. The new tax, if
passed in parliament, is due to start in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
