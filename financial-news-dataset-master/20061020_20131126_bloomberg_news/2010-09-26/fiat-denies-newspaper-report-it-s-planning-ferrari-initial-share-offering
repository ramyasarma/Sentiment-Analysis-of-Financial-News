Fiat SpA  denied a report in daily
Corriere della Sera that the Italian carmaker may sell shares of
 Ferrari SpA  in an initial public offering.  The newspaper reported today that Fiat may seek a stock
exchange listing for Ferrari to help fund the purchase of more
stock in Chrysler LLC. A Fiat spokesman denied the report by
phone today.  Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said Sept.
16 at a shareholders’ meeting in Turin, Italy that the company
wasn’t planning a Ferrari IPO now. He also said then that Fiat
was still in negotiations to raise its Ferrari stake to 90
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
