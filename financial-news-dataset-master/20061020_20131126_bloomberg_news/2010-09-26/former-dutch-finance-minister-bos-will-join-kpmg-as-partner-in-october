Former Dutch Finance Minister
 Wouter Bos  will join KPMG next month as a partner responsible
for the public sector and healthcare and as an adviser to the
financial industry department of the company.  “If ever it was important in the financial sector to
increase mutual understanding between the private sector and
politicians and supervisors, it is now,” Bos said in a
statement published on KPMG’s  website  today. Bos, who started
his career at  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , will work four days a week.  As finance minister, Bos in 2008 was involved in the
nationalization of some units of Fortis and ABN Amro Holding NV
as they struggled to find funding amid the credit crisis.  Bos resigned as finance minister and deputy prime minister
in February after the coalition cabinet he was part of broke up.
Bos was succeeded by Christian Democrat Jan Kees  de Jager, who
until then was state secretary of finance.  Bos, 47, said succeeding Dutch Central Bank President  Nout Wellink  wasn’t “under discussion now,” news agency ANP
reported earlier today, citing an interview. The term of
Wellink, who also sits on the European Central Bank Governing
Council, ends in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
