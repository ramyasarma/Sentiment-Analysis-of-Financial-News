Jordan’s economic growth
accelerated to an annual 2.9 percent in the second quarter, led
by the mining and transport industries.  The rate compares with 2 percent growth in the first
quarter of 2010, the state-run  Department of Statistics  said.
The kingdom’s economy grew 2.5 percent in the first half of the
year, it said. Growth was 2.3 percent in 2009.  Mining grew 18.2 percent in the quarter, followed by
transportation, storage and communications which increased 9.6
percent, according to preliminary results released by the Amman-
based department in an e-mailed statement.  The economy may expand 4 percent this year, Finance
Minister  Mohammad Abu Hammour  said in a May 20 interview, while
the  International Monetary Fund  says it may grow by 3.4 percent
in 2010 and 4.2 next year, as growth around the region
strengthens. Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the Middle
East, imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on
foreign investment and grants to finance deficits in the budget
and the current account.  Foreign grants more than doubled in the first seven months
of the year to 208 million dinars ($294 million), from 103
million dinars in the same period in 2009, the  Ministry of
Finance  said in a  preliminary report  earlier this month. The
kingdom’s budget deficit narrowed to 281 million dinars in the
seven months after receipt of the grants, compared with a
deficit of 641 million dinars the year earlier.  The projected budget deficit for this year after grants is
about 1 billion dinars, or 6 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with about 9 percent last year.  Agriculture, hunting and fishing rose 9.5 percent, finance
and insurance services expanded 5 percent, while manufacturing
grew 2 percent. Construction shrank by 12.2 percent while water
and electricity output decreased 5.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
