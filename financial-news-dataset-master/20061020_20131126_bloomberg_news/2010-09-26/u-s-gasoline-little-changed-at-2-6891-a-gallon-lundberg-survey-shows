The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations was little changed at $2.6891
a gallon even as supplies rose, according to  Trilby Lundberg , a
fuels analyst.  The price covers the two week period ended Sept. 24 and is
determined following a survey of 2,500 filling stations
nationwide by  Lundberg , an independent gasoline analyst in
Camarillo, California. Lundberg’s survey for the two-week period
ended Sept. 10 showed an average price of $2.6899 a gallon.  Markets are “awash in oil and gas,” Lundberg said in a
telephone interview today. “This tiny change per gallon should
have been more like a 7-cents a gallon drop,” said Lundberg.  Federal Reserve policy makers meeting in Washington said
last week they are willing to ease monetary policy to boost the
economy and lower unemployment. That “affected the dollar price
of crude,” sending it higher, she said.  Rising ethanol prices also propped up the motor fuel, she
said.  The front-month contract for crude oil was little changed
in the two weeks ended Sept. 24, gaining 4 cents to $76.49 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Gasoline for October delivery dropped 1.3 percent to
$1.9471 a gallon.  Gasoline Supply  Gasoline stockpiles  jumped 1.59 million barrels to 226.1
million in the week ended Sept. 17, the highest level since the
week ended March 12, according to the Energy Department.
Supplies of gasoline were 6.1 percent above a year earlier, and
15 percent above the five-year average.  Gasoline  consumption , as measured by what refiners and
blenders supply to wholesalers, fell 1.9 percent to an average
8.85 million barrels a day, the lowest level since Feb. 12,
according to the department.  U.S.  gasoline  demand at the pump rose for the first time in
five weeks in the seven days ended Sept. 17, gaining 1.9 percent
from the prior week’s 23-month low,  MasterCard Inc.  said Sept.
21 in its SpendingPulse report. The driving season traditionally
ends on Labor Day, which this year fell on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
