More than 100 metric tons of fish
were found dead at fish farms in China’s Huanghua river basin
downstream from a collapsed tailings dam at a tin mine owned by
Zijin Mining Group Co., the China Daily said.  The tailings dam at Zijin’s Xinyi Yinyan tin mine collapsed
on Sept. 21 after a landslide triggered by heavy rains caised by
Typhoon Fanapi, the newspaper said on its website.   The incident comes less than three months after one of
Zijin’s copper mines leaked toxic waste into a river, poisoning
almost 2,000 metric tons of fish in the Ting River. Zijin was
forced to shut its copper plant at the Zijinshan mine in Fujian
after the spill.        To contact the editor responsible for this story:
