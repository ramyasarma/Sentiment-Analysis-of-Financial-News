England’s John Parry won the
Vivendi Cup in Paris by two shots to claim a maiden European
Tour golf title on his first full season on the circuit.  The 23-year-old finished on 17-under-par 271 after a 2-
under final round. Sweden’s  Johan Edfors  was 15-under, with
Denmark’s Soren Kjeldsen among five players a stroke further
back. Ireland’s Padraig Harrington warmed up for the Ryder Cup
with an 8-under round to end on 13-under.  Parry collects a check for 204,160 euros ($275,000), the
biggest of his career. He’d recorded only two other top 10
finishes this year, with a best prize of 24,375 euros at the
Joburg Open in January.  The European Tour takes a break this week for the Ryder Cup
at Celtic Manor in Wales. Harrington was among three
“wildcard” picks for Europe’s team to face the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
