India’s money market rates at a
two-year high are making the shortest-term debt investments more
popular than stocks, bonds and gold amid a cash crunch at banks.  The  yield  on one-year treasury bills rose to 6.55 percent
on Sept. 24, about the highest level since December 2008 and 26
times the rate on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Short-term debt funds took in 532
billion rupees ($11.8 billion) in the first eight months of the
year, or 75 percent of the amount asset managers raised,
according to the  Association of Mutual Funds in India .  India’s bills pay the most in Asia except Vietnam as central
bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cuts money-supply growth to the
slowest rate since 2005 to fight  inflation . While policy makers
in the U.S. and Japan are injecting cash into economies where
rates are already near zero, the Reserve Bank of India has
raised borrowing costs five times this year, more than any other
monetary authority in the region.  “Short-term debt yields look quite attractive,”  Navneet Munot , who oversees $8.5 billion as chief investment officer at
Mumbai-based SBI Funds Management Pvt., a unit of the nation’s
largest lender, said in a Sept. 23 phone interview. “Yields are
now at a peak because the worst of inflation is behind us.”  Bills Versus Bonds  Rates on one-year government debt in India have jumped 1.97
percentage points this year, heading for a record annual surge
and dwarfing the 28 basis-point increase in the yield on 10-year
debt to 7.87 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
difference, or yield curve,  narrowed  to 1.32 percentage points
from a record 3.44 percentage points in December 2009.  India’s treasury bills returned an annualized  3.6 percent 
since Dec. 31, beating the  3.2 percent  for bonds, Bloomberg
calculations based on indexes compiled by the National Stock
Exchange of India Ltd. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch show.
Gains in the benchmark  Sensitive Index  of the nation’s shares
slowed to 16 percent this year from 74 percent in the year-
earlier period. Gold has advanced 18 percent in 2010.  Indians added 254 billion rupees to bond funds and pulled
out 76 billion rupees from equities in the eight months through
August, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds.  The government and banks are paying higher rates for short-
term borrowing because the central bank is restricting funds as
demand for credit increases. Bank notes, or certificates of
deposit, due in a year offer  8.05 percent , exceeding 10-year
bond yields across Asia excluding Pakistan. Comparable company
debt has a rate of  8.43 percent , Bloomberg data show.  Money Supply, Rates  Annual growth in bank lending accelerated to 20 percent in
August from a 12-year low of 9.5 percent in October 2009,
according to central bank data.  Yearly expansion in  money supply  slowed to 15 percent this
month from 20 percent a year earlier as Subbarao raised the
benchmark  reverse repurchase  rate by 1.75 percentage points this
year to 5 percent, Reserve Bank data show. The measure is set
for the biggest annual increase since it was introduced in 2000.  The central bank will boost rates at least 50 basis points
more in the year ending March 31, ING Investment Management
Pvt., an Indian venture of the biggest Dutch financial-services
company, forecasts.  Rising borrowing costs have helped lower the nation’s
inflation rate, measured by wholesale prices, to 8.5 percent in
August from a 20-month high of 11 percent in April. The central
bank estimates the pace of price gains, still the fastest in
Asia except Pakistan, will slow to 6 percent by March.  ING Forecast  “We’ll see more inflows into short-term debt funds as the
RBI continues to keep liquidity tight,” K. Ramanathan, who
helps manage the equivalent of $316 million in Mumbai at ING
Investment, said in an interview on Sept. 18. “As the central
bank raises interest rates, money-market rates will climb.”  The difference between India’s one- and 10-year bond yields
will shrink to 1 percentage point as the shorter-term rate
increases faster, he said, without specifying a time frame.  India’s reverse repo rate of 5 percent is the highest in
Asia excluding Indonesia and compares with benchmark rates of
zero to 0.25 percent in the U.S., 7.75 percent in Russia and
10.75 percent in Brazil. Asia’s third-biggest economy grew 8.8
percent last quarter from a year earlier, the most since 2007.  The Reserve Bank’s decision on whether to raise rates
further will depend on the pace of price increases as borrowing
costs are near their “neutral” level, Governor Subbarao said
on Sept. 20 in the southern city of Hyderabad.  Cash at Banks  Cash at India’s banks declined in the year that began April
as the government pursued a $99 billion borrowing program and
companies paid $23 billion in license fees for wireless-phone
services. The rate at which banks lend to one another  overnight 
rose to as high as 6.4 percent on Sept. 22 from 3.3 percent at
the start of the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investors may benefit from the surge in money-market rates
by agreeing to receive fixed one-year rates in exchange for
variable payments in a so-called interest-rate swap, according
to Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, a unit of
France’s second-biggest bank. The one-year swap rate, which has
gained 1.38 percentage points this year, was at 6.45 percent on
Sept. 24, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We believe that the market is overestimating the hawkish
bias of the Reserve Bank and underestimating the potential for
improvement in liquidity in the second half of 2011,”  Darius Kowalczyk  and  Frances Cheung , Hong Kong-based strategists at
Credit Agricole CIB, wrote in a research note on Sept. 22.  Relative Yields  India’s 10-year bond yield is the highest among major
economies except Brazil, where similar-maturity notes pay 11.75
percent. Comparable securities offer 7.62 percent in Russia and
3.32 percent in China and 2.61 percent in the U.S., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  difference  in yields between India’s debt due in a
decade and 10-year Treasuries was 5.26 percentage points on
Sept. 24, little changed from a week earlier. The measure, which
has averaged 3.18 points in the past decade, reached a two-year
high of 5.56 points on Aug. 26.  One-year bills now yield 6.26 percentage points more than
the three-month dollar London interbank  offered rate , a measure
of funding costs for global investors that is currently 0.29
percent, Bloomberg data show. The spread is about the widest
since September 2008.  Foreign  holdings  of India’s corporate and government debt
more than doubled in 2010 to a record $17.4 billion on Sept. 23
as yields climbed. Accelerated investment inflows helped the
rupee strengthen 4 percent against the dollar this month, the
best performance among Asia’s 10-most traded currencies.  “The strong capital inflows will help ease the cash crunch
in the coming months,” SBI Funds’ Munot said. “That will boost
short-term debt prices, and investors who already own them will
gain.”  Indian banks’ loans rose 315 billion rupees in the two
weeks ended Sept. 10, raising outstanding advances to 33.8
trillion rupees, central bank data showed Sept. 24. Loans to
industry and consumers rose 277 billion rupees during the
period, while food credit rose 38.3 billion rupees. Credit rose
19.8 percent, or by 5.58 trillion rupees, in the 12 months
through Sept. 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
