Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
agreed to pay about 5.5 billion kroner ($935 million) in cash
for a 77 percent stake in Norwegian business software maker
 Visma A/S .  The U.S. private equity firm is acquiring the stake from a
group led by HgCapital, said  Nic Humphries , chief executive
officer of HGCapital, by phone. Intermediate Capital Group and
Citi Private Equity are part of the group.  HgCapital, a London-based venture capital company that held
50 percent of Visma, is keeping an 18 percent stake, while
management will hold the remainder, Humphries said.  KKR’s acquisition, its first in Norway, brings to 12 the
number of technology companies in its portfolio, the New York-
based company said in a statement. Oslo-based Visma’s profit has
more than doubled since 2006 when HgCapital won a bidding war
with Sage Group Plc, Britain’s biggest accounting software
maker, that valued Visma at 4.3 billion kroner.  The acquisition values all of Visma at 11 billion kroner,
excluding 900 million kroner in cash that the company holds,
Humphries said. The valuation includes 4.5 billion kroner of
debt, he said.  ‘Return Some Cash’  “We wanted to return some cash” to investors, Humphries
said. “And we wanted to have some of the future growth. We will
continue to think about an initial public offering in two to
three years from now.”  HgCapital, which has 2.4 billion pounds ($3.8 billion)
under management, removed Visma from the Oslo exchange in 2006.
It made an initial investment of 82 million pounds in the
company and then spent another 19 million pounds on
acquisitions.  Visma will report earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 865 million kroner this year,
HgCapital said. Ebitda was 320 million kroner in 2006.  KKR, which had $54.4 billion under management as of June
30, will work with HGCapital and Visma management to expand the
company further, Mati Szeszkowski, head of KKR’s European
technology team, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
