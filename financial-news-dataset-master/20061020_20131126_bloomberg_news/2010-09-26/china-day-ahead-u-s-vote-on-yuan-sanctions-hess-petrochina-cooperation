The House will vote this week on
legislation pressing China to raise the value of its currency,
after a panel approved the measure showing support for U.S.
manufacturers before the November election.  The Ways and Means Committee adopted the measure by voice
vote after the panel’s top Republican, Dave Camp  of Michigan,
joined Democrats in endorsing the bill. Panel Chairman  Sander Levin  of Michigan, a Democrat, said the full House will vote on
the legislation on Sept. 29.  The measure would let companies petition for higher duties
on imports from China to compensate for the effect of a weak
currency. President  Barack Obama  “does not take a position on
this specific legislation,” Jeff Bader, his director of Asian
affairs, said.  Hess-PetroChina Tie-up  Hess Corp. , the fifth-biggest U.S. oil company, will
explore for crude in China in cooperation with PetroChina Co.,
the nation’s largest oil company,  Hess and PetroChina will work with dense rock in the Daqing
oil field, a formation that’s similar to the Bakken basin in
North Dakota, where Hess is already exploring,  Jay Wilson , a
Hess spokesman, said by telephone.  Canada China Backlash  Canadian Trade Minister  Peter Van Loan  said China’s
currency policies risk fueling a public backlash against Chinese
investments in the North American country, and allowing the yuan
to move freely could reduce trade imbalances.  “The risk for the Chinese is that if Canadians politically
begin to feel that they are too disadvantaged you’re going to
start seeing the kind of reactions you’re seeing in the United
States,” Van Loan, 47, said an interview in his parliamentary
office. “We don’t want to see that. We want to keep trade open,
we want to keep investment open.”  China Wants Climate Deal  China wants a binding global climate-change agreement by
late 2011, the  China Economic Times reported , citing Li Gao, a
Chinese negotiator.  China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, hopes
definite measures for the next decade will be implemented after
the United Nations conference in South Africa scheduled for the
end of next year, Li told the newspaper. The biggest obstacle to
reaching an accord is the U.S., he said.  United Biscuits  Bright Food Group Co. Ltd., Shanghai’s biggest food and
dairy company, is in discussions about a possible purchase of
the U.K.’s United Biscuits from Blackstone Group and PAI
Partners.  The Sunday Times reported that Bright Food is in exclusive
talks to buy United Biscuits, the maker of Jaffa Cake and
McVitie’s cookies, in a transaction that may be valued at 2
billion pounds ($3.2 billion).  “Bright Food is now in talks about buying United
Biscuits,” Chen Chunshan, a company spokesman in Shanghai, said
in a phone interview, declining to comment further.  Boshiwa IPO  Boshiwa International Holding Ltd. , a retailer of
children’s clothing, raised HK$2.49 billion ($321 million) in an
initial public offering in Hong Kong after selling stock at the
top of the forecast range, said two people familiar with the
sale.  Boshiwa sold 500 million shares at HK$4.98 each, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information
was private. The Shanghai-based company initially offered shares
at HK$3.88 to HK$4.98 each, according to its prospectus.  TVB Acquisition  Hong Kong Billionaire Lee  Shau-Kee may pay about HK$9
billion for a majority stake in Television Broadcasts Ltd.,
Apple Daily reported Sept. 25, without saying where it obtained
the information.  Lee will acquire the stakes held by TVB Chairman Sir Run
Run Shaw and Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd., the newspaper said.  China Southern Buy and Hold  China has something the U.S. lacks, an airline stock that
investors can buy and hold, according to  Kenneth Fisher , the
billionaire chairman of Fisher Investments Inc. and columnist
for Forbes magazine.  China Southern Airlines Co. , the nation’s largest carrier,
is a stock that investors can retain for “5 to 10 years,”
Fisher, 59, said in an interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene . The company is “a functional representation of
China’s basic need to engage in global trade to grow,” said
Fisher, who oversees $35 billion from Woodside, California.
“You can’t really do that in this day and age without a global
airline.”  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  Bright Dairy & Food Co.  (600597 CH) won regulatory approval
