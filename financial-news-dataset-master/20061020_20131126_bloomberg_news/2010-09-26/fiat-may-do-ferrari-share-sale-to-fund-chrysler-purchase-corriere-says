Fiat SpA  may sell shares of  Ferrari
SpA  in an initial public offering to help fund the purchase of
more stock in Chrysler LLC, daily Corriere della Sera reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Fiat first wants to raise its stake in Ferrari to 90
percent by buying 5 percent held by Mubadala Development Co.,
according to the Italian newspaper. Ferrari might be valued at
3.1 billion euros ($4.2 billion) according to the newspaper.  Fiat Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said Sept.
16 at a shareholders’ meeting in Turin, Italy that the company
wasn’t planning a Ferrari now. He also said then that Fiat was
still in negotiations to raise its Ferrari stake to 90 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
