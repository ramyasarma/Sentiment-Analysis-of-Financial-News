The Texas Rangers reached the Major
League Baseball playoffs for the first time since 1999,
clinching the American League West with a 4-3 win over the
Oakland Athletics.  Jorge Cantu ’s eighth-inning home run last night at the
Oakland Coliseum broke a 3-3 tie and Texas clinched the division
title when reliever  Neftali Feliz  got  Cliff Pennington  to fly
out to left field for the final out.  The Rangers (86-68) became the second major-league team to
clinch a playoff berth, joining the AL Central champion
Minnesota Twins. Oakland fell to 77-77.  The AL East-leading Tampa Bay Rays extended their advantage
over the New York Yankees with a 9-1 win over the Seattle
Mariners and the Yankees’ 7-3 loss to the Boston Red Sox.  Starter  Matt Garza  (15-9) gave up one run in seven innings
of work for the Rays (93-61), who now hold a 1 1/2-game lead
over New York. Tampa needs any combination of two wins or Red
Sox losses to lock up a playoff berth.  The loss for the Yankees (92-63) was their fourth straight.  Boston starter  Jon Lester  (19-9) allowed two hits in seven
shutout innings, becoming the first Red Sox left-hander to win
19 games in 57 years.  J.D. Drew hit his 20th home run and  Victor Martinez  his
19th as the Red Sox drew within 5 1/2 games of the Yankees with
eight games to play. The Yankees host the Red Sox today and play
three games at Boston’s Fenway Park to close the season.  Tulowitzki’s Game-Winner  Troy Tulowitzki  hit a game-winning double that scored
 Carlos Gonzalez  as the Colorado Rockies beat the San Francisco
Giants 10-9 in 10 innings at Coors Field. Tulowitzki went 4-for-
5 with five runs batted in, hitting his 27th homer this season.  The defeat drops the Giants to 87-68, a half-game behind
the San Diego Padres in the National League West. The Padres
knocked off the Cincinnati Reds 4-3 at home.  The Rockies are 83-71, 3 1/2 games behind the Giants and
Atlanta Braves in the race for the NL wild card, which is given
to the team in each league that has the best record without
winning its division.  Bobby Cox , who is retiring after the season, won his
2,500th game as a major-league manager as the Braves topped the
Nationals 5-0 in Washington.  Derek Lowe  (15-12) pitched five shutout innings to earn the
win as the Braves ended a four-game skid.  The Philadelphia Phillies had their 11-game winning streak
snapped by a 5-2 loss to the New York Mets. Philadelphia (93-62)
needs any combination of two wins or losses by the Braves to
clinch the NL East. The Phillies again host the Mets today in
Philadelphia’s final regular-season home game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
