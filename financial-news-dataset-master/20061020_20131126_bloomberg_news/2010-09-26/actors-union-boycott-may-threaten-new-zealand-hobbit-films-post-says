Filming of “The Hobbit” could be
moved from New Zealand after several actors’ unions told workers
to boycott the film, the Dominion Post  reported .  The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, an Australian-
based union, urged actors not to accept work on the film until
producers provided standard union contracts, the newspaper said
today, citing National Director Simon Whipp. Members of the
U.K.’s  British Actors’ Equity  also support a boycott, the
newspaper said.  New Zealand would be “humiliated” and film studios may
avoid the country if the boycott took place, the Post reported,
citing the film’s executive producer  Peter Jackson .  A union contract ensures producers pay fees, including
payments from DVD sales and video rentals, to workers on the
$150 million two-part “Lord of the Rings” prequel, the
newspaper said.  MEAA  members will meet in Auckland tomorrow to assess
their options, the Post reported.  To contact the reporter for this story:
