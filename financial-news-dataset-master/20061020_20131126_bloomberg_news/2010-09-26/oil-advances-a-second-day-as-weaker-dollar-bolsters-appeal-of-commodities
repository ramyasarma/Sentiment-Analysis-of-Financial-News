Oil rose for a fourth day in New
York as equities climbed on signs of renewed capital purchases
by businesses and consumers, boosting traders’ expectations of
increases in fuel demand.  Crude extended its 1.7 percent gain on Sept. 24 after the
euro strengthened against the greenback following a report that
German business confidence climbed to a three-year high. U.S.
 durable goods orders , not including volatile transportation
items, increased a more-than-expected 2 percent in August.
Capital equipment purchases rebounded 4.1 percent after falling
in July, the Commerce Department said Sept. 24.  “The durable goods orders reflect a bit more of a buoyant
manufacturing sector and that’s been a pivot point for the
economy over the last six to 12 months.,” said  David Taylor , an
analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. “With that better-than-
expected data, it’s not surprising to see equity markets
rally.”  Crude for November delivery climbed as much as 36 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $76.85 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest since Sept. 14. It was at $76.60 at 9:39
a.m. Singapore time. The contract settled up $1.31 at $76.49 on
Sept. 24.  Oil rose that day as the dollar fell to its lowest level
against the euro since April 20, boosting the appeal of
commodities. The gain was the biggest since Sept. 10, when the
shutdown of an Enbridge Energy Partners LP pipeline curbed
deliveries of Canadian oil to U.S. Midwest refineries.  Brent crude oil for November settlement climbed as much as
28 cents to $79.15 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, and was at $78.82. The contract gained 76 cents, or 1
percent, to end the session at $78.87 on Sept. 24.  Asian Equities  The price difference between Brent and West Texas futures
in New York has narrowed to $2.23 a barrel today from $4.46 a
week earlier.  Asian stocks rose today, extending a four-week rally, after
a government report showed U.S. demand for capital goods
increased more than expected.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent to 126.19.
Almost four stocks advanced for each one that declined in the
gauge, which is set for its biggest monthly advance since July,
having climbed 8.3 percent this month.  Hedge funds and other market speculators reduced their bets
that crude oil prices would climb. The net-long  positions  held
by money managers declined by 16,286 contracts, or 13 percent,
to 106,323 for the week ended Sept. 21, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report.  Hedge funds also increased bets to the highest level in six
weeks that diesel prices will climb as U.S. exports to Europe
doubled for the industrial and transportation fuel. Bullish
wagers on heating oil, a proxy for diesel, climbed by 58 percent
in the week ended Sept. 21, the CFTC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
