Power Companies looking to operate
nuclear plants in India won’t be allowed to hold a majority
shareholding in the entity, the Business Standard reported today
citing Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state for science and
technology.  The companies, which could include Reliance Power Ltd.,
Tata Power Co. Ltd. and GVK Power & Infrastructure Ltd., will
need to set up a joint venture with the state-owned Nuclear
Power Corporation, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
