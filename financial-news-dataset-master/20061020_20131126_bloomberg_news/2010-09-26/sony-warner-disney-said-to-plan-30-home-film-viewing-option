Sony Pictures, Warner Bros. and
 Walt Disney Co.  are in talks with the largest cable TV systems
to offer films for as much as $30 per showing soon after they
run in theaters.  The studios are talking with In Demand, a partnership of
Cox Communications Inc.,  Comcast Corp.  and  Time Warner Cable
Inc. ,  Bob Benya , chief executive officer of In Demand, said in
an interview. Disney is also discussing streaming films on Web-
linked devices such as  Microsoft Corp. ’s Xbox console and  Sony’s
Corp. ’s PlayStation 3, people with knowledge of the talks said.  Hollywood studios have been looking for ways to generate
additional sales from movies as DVD purchases continue to
decline. A so-called “premium” service would let consumers see
movies on TV without waiting the typical three or four months
for DVDs or cable companies’ $4 or so on-demand showings.  “I think there are a number of other products that we will
be able to create through Internet-connected television,
particularly when you consider our brand focus,”  Robert Iger, 
CEO of Burbank, California-based Disney said at a Goldman Sachs
Groups Inc. conference on Sept. 21.  Sony Corp.  tested the market with users of its Bravia TV by
offering the  Will Smith  movie “Hancock” in 2008 and the
animated film “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” in 2009 for
$24.95. The Tokyo-based owner of Sony Pictures hasn’t announced
plans for another movie through its TV sets.  Time Warner Inc. Chief Financial Officer  John Martin  told
the Goldman Sachs conference in New York last week that the
company’s Warner Bros. studio expects to begin tests on the
service later this year. He said he expected the offering to be
priced at $20 to $30 per viewing.  Disney Test  Disney is likely to test consumer interest in the first
quarter using a single film, said one of the people, who
requested anonymity because the decisions are pending. The
company hasn’t decided on pricing or how long to wait after
theatrical release, the person said.  Jonathan Friedland , a
Disney spokesman, wouldn’t comment on the plan.  Patrick Seybold , a spokesman for Sony’s PlayStation
network, declined to comment, as did  Jim Kennedy , a spokesman
for Sony’s film division. An outside public relations
representative for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft didn’t
respond.  Disney, the world’s largest media company, rose 46 cents to
$33.58 on Sept. 24 in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading .
New York-based Time Warner added 61 cents to $31.37. Sony’s U.S.
traded shares gained 94 cents to $31. Time Warner Cable, also
based in New York, advanced $1.46 to $53.11, and Philadelphia-
based Comcast, the largest U.S. cable system, was up 65 cents to
$18.57 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
