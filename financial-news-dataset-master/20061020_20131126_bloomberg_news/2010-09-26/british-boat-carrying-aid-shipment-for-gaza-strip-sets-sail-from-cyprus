A boat sailing under a British flag
carrying toys, musical instruments, textbooks, fishing nets and
prosthetic limbs left Cyprus for the Gaza Strip today to protest
Israel’s embargo on the Hamas-controlled territory.  Passengers on the “Irene,” won’t “engage in any physical
confrontation and will therefore not present Israelis with any
reason or excuse to use physical force,” Richard Kuper, a
member of  Jews for the Justice of Palestinians , one of the
sponsors of the boat, said in an e-mailed statement today.  On May 31, nine Turks were killed when violence broke out
as Israeli naval commandos tried to stop an aid flotilla from
reaching Gaza and breaking the naval blockade.  Israel says the blockade is legal because it’s in “a state
of armed conflict” with Hamas, which is considered a terrorist
organization by the U.S., European Union and Israel.  Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, ending a partnership
government with Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas ’s
Fatah party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
