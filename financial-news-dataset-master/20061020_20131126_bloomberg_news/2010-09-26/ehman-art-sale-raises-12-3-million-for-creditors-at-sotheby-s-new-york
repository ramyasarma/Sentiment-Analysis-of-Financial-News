Bidders snubbed a six-foot wide
turquoise 1993  Damien Hirst  cabinet, estimated to fetch as much
as $1.2 million at the Lehman and Neuberger Berman art
liquidation sale held in New York on Saturday.  Sotheby’s  tan-carpeted saleroom went quiet as not a single
bidder vied for Hirst’s “We’ve Got Style (The Vessel Collection
-- Blue/Green).” The irony was not lost on observers.  “On the day Lehman went bust, Hirst made a fortune,’’ said
private New York dealer Neal Meltzer, referring to Sotheby’s
Sept. 15-16, 2008 auction of work from Hirst’s studio, which
grossed about $200 million. “On the day Lehman liquidates
Neuberger’s collection, Hirst was out of luck.’’  The Hirst was the nadir of an otherwise mostly solid sale.
The bankrupt  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  raised $12.3 million
for creditors, just above the $8.8 million to $12 million
presale estimate. Of 142 lots on offer, 118, or 83 percent,
found buyers.  The priciest lot seemed thematically on point: a swirling
2001 canvas evoking chaos and implosion, by painter  Julie Mehretu , “Untitled 1’’ sold for $1 million to an unidentified
phone bidder, topping the $800,000 high estimate. Mehretu’s
previous highest price at auction was $394,038, in 2009.  Neuberger’s foresight provided Lehman a handy return,
having acquired the Mehretu in 2001 for $21,726. The artist
recently completed a mural for the lobby of  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. ’s New York office. New York-based asset management firm
Neuberger Berman Holdings LLC was acquired by Lehman in 2003 and
their art collections were merged.  Girl in a Snowstorm  Other hefty prices were achieved for a rainbow-hued canvas
by  Mark Grotjahn , which fetched $782,500, and Chinese painter
 Liu Ye ’s 2004 “The Long Way Home,’’ of a girl in a snowstorm,
which sold for $962,500, above the $700,000 presale projection.  Hirst wasn’t the only fashionable name to founder.  John Currin ’s painting of a matronly woman, the 1991 “Shakespeare
Actress,’’ sold for $362,500, less than half the $700,000 high
estimate.  Richard Prince ’s 2003 joke painting on gatorboard
fetched $212,500, also half the $400,000 high estimate.  Results overall were respectable rather than spectacular,
especially given the sale’s presale buzz. “You had curiosity
from the global financial community,’’ said Sotheby’s  Tobias Meyer , worldwide head of contemporary art. “You had attention
from Wall Street, but Wall Street is not the art world.’’  While the bidding was dominated by serious contemporary art
collectors, attracted to the higher caliber work, a smattering
of Wall Streeters were attracted by the Lehman history. New York
art adviser Maria Carlota Perez bid for a finance-industry
client she declined to name who had “affection’’ for Lehman’s
storied past. Her buys included a 1983 orange collage by German
artist Imi Knoebel for $23,750.  Banker Outbid  A former Lehman investment banker who declined to identify
herself came in pursuit of a print by artist Vik Muniz, lured in
part by the Lehman link. Estimated to sell for up to $8,000,
Muniz’s 1998 silver gelatin print of a tree, from an edition of
five, sold for $23,750, leaving the ex-Lehman banker outbid.  More Lehman art will be sold at  Christie’s International  in
London on Sept. 29 and at Freeman’s in Philadelphia on Nov. 7.  Artsy types at the Sotheby’s sale said they didn’t care one
way or another about the Lehman name.  “Do you think the person who bought the Grotjahn cares it
belonged to Lehman?’’ said private art advisor Josh Baer. “It’s
not  Jackie Kennedy ,’’ he said, referring to Sotheby’s 1996
blockbuster celebrity-estate sale.  Despite some upbeat results, the sale made for poor theater.
Most of the bidding occurred over the phones, conducted by
Sotheby’s phalanx of 22 staffers, about as exciting as watching
a tennis match with invisible players.  Backseat Observers  The Saturday morning sale attracted an atypical blend of
loafer-clad finance types and die-hard contemporary art
collectors, dealers and advisers. The bulk of attendees
clustered in folding chairs toward the back of the salesroom,
ready to observe, not bid.  Auction newbies included a man seated up front, wearing
running shorts, sneakers and a well-worn T-shirt that read
“Thank you Paine Webber.” He winced when auctioneer Meyer
announced the customary 25 percent commission on all purchases
at the start of the sale.  On the sidewalk outside Sotheby’s, painter Geoffrey Raymond
hawked a $45,000 painting of a sinister-looking  Richard Fuld 
titled “The Liquidated Fuld.’’ Raymond has also painted  Eliot Spitzer  and  Richard Grasso , among others. He invited passersby
to write comments around Fuld’s head.  “My Lehman is at the Metropolitan Museum,’’ wrote one.
“I’m still speechless’’ wrote another. “You turd, you cost me
and my clients money,’’ noted a third.  Raymond said he had melded the painting styles of Jackson
Pollock and  Chuck Close  for his Fuld likeness. “It speaks on so
many levels,’’ said Raymond. “Plus, it’s a smoking painting of
 Dick Fuld .’’  To contact the reporter on the story:
