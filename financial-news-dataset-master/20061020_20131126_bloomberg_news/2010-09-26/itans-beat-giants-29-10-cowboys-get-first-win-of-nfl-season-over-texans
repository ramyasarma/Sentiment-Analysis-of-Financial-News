Braylon Edwards  returned from a
first-quarter suspension and had a 67-yard touchdown catch as
the New York Jets beat the Miami Dolphins 31-23 to end a three-
game losing streak against their division rivals.  Edwards sat out the opening 15 minutes of the National
Football League game last night because of his Sept. 21 arrest
for driving while intoxicated.  After the Dolphins scored 17 straight points to overcome a
14-0 deficit at Sun Life Stadium in Miami, Edwards’s touchdown
midway through the third quarter put the Jets back in front for
good.  Mark Sanchez  threw three touchdown passes for the second
straight game as the Jets improved to 2-1.  “It was a dogfight and I’m just glad to be on the winning
side,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said during a news conference,
minutes after New York clinched the win with an interception in
its end zone with 27 seconds left.  While the Jets won their second in a row, the New York
Giants lost for the second straight week.  Chris Johnson  rushed
for two touchdowns to lead the Tennessee Titans to a 29-10 win
at New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  Tennessee took advantage of three Giants’ turnovers and 11
penalties, including one that led to a third-quarter safety and
gave the Titans a lead they wouldn’t relinquish.  “We all understand that we beat ourselves,” Giants coach
 Tom Coughlin  said.  Cowboys Avoid 0-3  The Dallas Cowboys beat the Houston Texans 27-13 on the
road as  Tony Romo  threw two touchdown passes to  Roy Williams .  Dallas, which entered the season tied as the second-
favorite among Las Vegas oddsmakers to win the Super Bowl,
avoided its first 0-3 start since 2001, the year after Hall of
Fame quarterback  Troy Aikman  retired.  No NFL team has started a season with three straight losses
and recovered to win the Super Bowl.  “We really had our backs against the wall with our bye
week coming up,” Cowboys owner  Jerry Jones  told reporters. “If
we didn’t get it done here, it would be five weeks of the NFL
season without a win. That was very much etched in my mind as
well as the players.”  At the Superdome in New Orleans, the Atlanta Falcons sent
the Super Bowl-champion Saints to their first loss of the season
as  Matt Bryant  kicked a 46-yard field goal in overtime for a 27-
24 win.  Garrett Hartley  made a 32-yard field goal for the Saints
(2-1) with nine seconds left in the fourth quarter to force
overtime. He then missed a 29-yard attempt during New Orleans’
first possession in extra time and Atlanta (2-1) drove 57 yards
for the winning kick.  Steelers Undefeated  The Pittsburgh Steelers stayed unbeaten without suspended
quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  as backup  Charlie Batch  threw
three first-half touchdown passes in a 38-13 win over the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers in a matchup of 2-0 teams.  The Minnesota Vikings beat the Detroit Lions 24-10 for
their first victory of the season.  Adrian Peterson  rushed for
160 yards and scored two touchdowns for the Vikings (1-2).  Michael Vick  passed for three touchdowns and ran for
another score as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Jacksonville
Jaguars 28-3. Vick passed for 291 yards for the Eagles (2-1),
who next week will host former quarterback  Donovan McNabb  and
the Washington Redskins.  Also in Week 3, it was Cincinnati 20, Carolina 7; Baltimore
24, Cleveland 17; Kansas City 31, San Francisco 10; Indianapolis
27, Denver 13; Seattle 27, San Diego 20; New England 38, Buffalo
30; Arizona 24, Oakland 23; and St. Louis 30, Washington 16.  The Green Bay Packers visit the Chicago Bears today.  Sanchez to Keller  In Miami, Sanchez threw two touchdown passes to  Dustin Keller  to give the Jets a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter.
The Dolphins rallied behind  Brandon Marshall , who caught 10
passes for 166 yards.  Marshall caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from  Chad Henne 
with 8:47 left in the third quarter that gave the Dolphins a 17-
14 advantage. The Jets went back in front 18 seconds later, as
Edwards spun away from a defender after hauling in his first
pass and raced to the end zone.  Edwards later added a 20-yard reception that helped set up
the Jets’ final score, a 1-yard run by  LaDainian Tomlinson  with
1:55 remaining.  The Dolphins drove to the Jets’ 6-yard line before Henne’s
fourth-down pass was tipped by  Eric Smith  and intercepted in the
end zone by  Drew Coleman .  Henne passed for 363 yards and two scores for the Dolphins,
who fell into a three-way tie with the Jets and Patriots atop
the American Football Conference’s East Division with 2-1
records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
