Anglo Irish Bank Corp. may need a
total capital injection of between 28 billion euros to 29
billion euros, the Sunday Business Post said, without citing
anyone. That figure includes over 20 billion euros already
injected or pledged to the Dublin-based lender.  Ireland’s regulator is due to this week release an estimate
the cost of recapitalizing the state-owned lender as it’s split
into a deposit bank and an asset recovery bank. The regulator
may detail an expected total and a separate figure which would
take account of a stressed scenario based on bigger losses on
Anglo, the Dublin-based newspaper said. A Finance Ministry
spokesman said he could not comment on the report or a report in
the Sunday Times that the government may offer to buy back
senior Anglo Irish debt at a discount.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
