Chinese food manufacturer Bright
Food is in exclusive negotiations about buying the U.K.’s United
Biscuits, the Sunday Times reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The Shanghai-based company edged out rivals, including
 Campbell Soup Co. , in a takeover battle that may value the U.K.
maker of Jaffa Cake and McVitie’s biscuits at 2 billion pounds
($3.16 billion), the newspaper said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
