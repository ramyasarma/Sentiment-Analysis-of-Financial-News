             Dynegy Inc. (DYN)  forecast a profit for
2007 after the acquisition of power plants from LS Power Group
for $2.65 billion.  
 Dynegy, in a statement today, forecast 2007 net income
available to common shareholders of $190 million to $255 million.
That compares with the Houston-based company's forecast in
November for a 2006 loss of $305 million to $325 million.  
 The 2007 forecast, which is equivalent to about 25 cents to
34 cents a share, reflects the impact of the acquisition of
plants from closely held LS Power of East Brunswick, New Jersey,
Dynegy said. The transaction is expected to close at the end of
the first quarter of 2007, the company said  
 ``It's pretty much in line with our expectations,'' said
 Daniele Seitz , an analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. in New York who
rates Dynegy shares a ``buy'' and owns none. Seitz said she
expected 2007 profit of 39 cents a share based on a full year of
results from the LS Power plants.  
 Dynegy expects proceeds that may top $500 million from the
sale of non-core assets in 2007 and will record pretax costs of
about $40 million this quarter because of the reduced value of a
plant in the U.S. Southeast, Chief Financial Officer Holli Nichols said on a conference call with analysts and investors.
She didn't identify the plant that will be written down.  
 Shares of Dynegy rose 15 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $6.85 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has  risen  19
percent since the acquisition of the LS Power plants was
announced on Sept. 15.  
 Heightened Capacity  
 The acquisition will expand Dynegy's generating  capacity  by
71 percent to almost 20,000 megawatts, or enough to supply 16
million U.S. homes, slides prepared by Dynegy for the call
showed. That will make the company the third-largest U.S. power
producer that doesn't own utilities.  
 Plants that will be put up for sale next year mostly are so-
called peakers that are called into service only during times of
maximum demand, Nichols said. The plant whose value will be
written down this quarter also is a peaker, she said.  
 LS Power will get 40 percent of Dynegy's stock and $375
million in cash and notes for the plants. The companies will
create a joint venture to build new plants and expand existing
ones.  
 Dynegy's chief executive officer, Bruce Williamson, sold
assets and unwound a failed energy trading business to avoid
bankruptcy after the collapse of Enron Corp. in 2001.  
 Calpine Corp., which is reorganizing in bankruptcy,
currently is the largest independent power producer in the U.S.
and NRG Energy Inc. is second largest.
