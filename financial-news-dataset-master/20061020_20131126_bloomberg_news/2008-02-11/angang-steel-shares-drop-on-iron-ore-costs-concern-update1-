             Angang Steel Co. (347) , China's second-
biggest steelmaker by market value, and rival  Maanshan Iron &
Steel (600808)  Co. fell in Hong Kong trading on speculation higher iron-
ore prices may cut earnings.  
 Iron ore, a steelmaking ingredient, sold under long-term
supply contracts could rise as much as 80 percent from April,
according to a survey of four analysts Bloomberg News published
Feb. 8. The biggest gain previously was 71.5 percent in 2005.  
 ``The forecast of a 80 percent increase in iron-ore price
is much higher than the average 50 percent increase that markets
expect,'' said Wayne Fung, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Everbright Securities Co. ``Chinese steelmakers would suffer
more pressure on bottom-lines as they need to rely on imports.''  
 Angang Steel fell 6 percent, or 94 Hong Kong cents, to
HK$14.54 at the 4:00 p.m. close on the city's bourse, the
biggest decline since Jan. 28.  Maanshan Iron (323)  declined 4.3
percent to HK$4.05. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell 3.6
percent.  
 Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group,
the world's three biggest iron-ore exporters, are seeking to
raise prices for a sixth straight year as demand from Chinese
steelmakers outpaces supply.
