             Epoch Holding Corp. (EPHC) , a  New York- 
based investment manager, climbed the most in three months after
being selected by  New York  Life Investment Management LLC to
manage $1.1 billion in assets of its MainStay Funds.  
 Epoch rose 91 cents, or 13 percent, to $7.85 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , the biggest percentage increase
since March 26. The stock has lost 14 percent in the past 12
months.  
 Epoch Investment Partners Inc., the sole operating unit of
Epoch, will manage assets in six portfolios, according to a
statement today. Epoch had assets under management of more than
$5.3 billion at the end of last year.  
 “This is a tremendous thing for the company,” said Dennis Barrett, a New York-based analyst for Sidoti & Co LLC, who has a
“buy” rating on the stock.  
 Barrett increased his fiscal 2009 earnings estimate by 1
cent to 14 cents and boosted his estimate for next year to 46
cents from 37 cents. The analyst predicts that Epoch will have
$14.3 billion in assets under management by the end of fiscal
2011. Epoch’s fiscal year ends in June.
