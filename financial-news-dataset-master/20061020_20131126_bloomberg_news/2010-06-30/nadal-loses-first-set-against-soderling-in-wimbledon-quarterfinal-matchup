             Rafael Nadal, the 2008 Wimbledon
champion, lost the opening set of his quarterfinal at the All
England Club today to Sweden’s Robin Soderling.  
 The Spaniard, who missed Wimbledon last year with a knee
injury, is the top-ranked player on the ATP Tour, but is seeded
No. 2 at Wimbledon. The sixth-ranked Soderling took the set 6-3.  
 Nadal claimed his seventh Grand Slam title earlier this
month at the French Open, beating Soderling in the final.
