             Ford Motor Co.  will pay about $3.8
billion in cash to a union health-care fund, a sign the
automaker is confident that Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s focus on the namesake brand will produce profits.  
 Ford was required to pay $859 million to the United Auto
Workers Retiree Medical Benefits Trust by June 30 to fund
benefits for former hourly workers. Ford paid cash even though
it had the option to pay as much as $610 million in stock under
an agreement reached with the union last year. It also prepaid
$2.9 billion toward its health-care obligations, it said today.  
 Ford defied the expectations of  analysts  who had said the
automaker would pay a portion of its obligation in stock because
the second-largest U.S. automaker’s shares have been trading
down since closing at a 52-week high of $14.46 on April 26. The
chief of Ford’s Americas unit also warned analysts the U.S. auto
market had “flat-lined” since last year’s third quarter as
consumers avoided making big purchases.  
 “There was speculation that they would pay with equity;
that would have been a bit alarming,” said  Colin Langan , an
analyst with UBS Securities. “With all of the risk out there,
it’s a good sign that they feel they can pay with cash.”  
 Ford rose 50 cents to $10.38 at 2:08 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, reversing a five trading-day
decline.  
 Ford said it will pay $3.8 billion in cash to the UAW
trust, dropping its balance owed to the fund to $3.6 billion.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said it is also paying
$255 million in deferred dividends to another trust held by
other investors.  
 Debt Reduction  
 Added with other debt payments made in the second quarter,
Ford said it has reduced debt by $7 billion in the quarter,
reducing annual interest payments by $470 million. At the end of
the first quarter, Ford had $34 billion in debt. This should
reduce Ford’s debt to as low as $27 billion.  
 “Our One Ford plan to profitably grow our business is
working, and we are increasingly confident about our future,”
Mulally said in a statement. “We expect to continue to improve
our balance sheet as we deliver on our plan.”  
 Ford used cash for its first payment of $610 million in
December and pre-paid an additional $500 million after its
shares had a fourfold annual  gain  last year. The company said at
the time that it paid in cash because the stock’s volume-
weighted average  share  price in the period before the payment,
which determines the price of the stock it issues to the trust,
was $9.13, less than the $10 the stock closed at on Dec. 31.  
 The stock closed yesterday at $9.88, 13 percent below the
average of about $11.35 in the 30 trading days ending June 28.
The company has 3.34 billion shares outstanding.  
 Cash Surprise  
 Kristin Dziczek , director of the labor industry group at
the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said
she had expected Ford to make payments to the union’s trust in
stock, which would have preserved cash while producing minimal
dilution for shareholders.  
 “It was a big surprise,” she said. “This is a move to
try to get on equal footing with other auto companies. Ford
still has a dirty balance sheet.”  
 Ford has $22.3 billion in automotive gross cash after
paying $3 billion on its revolving  credit line  in April, said
 Mark Fields , the company’s president of the Americas. Ford also
has $31.3 billion in automotive debt, higher than rivals such as
General Motors Co., the largest U.S. automaker, he said.  
 Of the $4 billion, $1.3 billion will come from Ford Credit,
reducing the drain on automotive cash. In the first quarter,
Ford earned $2.1 billion in  cash flow  from operations.  
 2006 Borrowing  
 Ford borrowed $23 billion in late 2006, giving it a cash
cushion that helped it withstand losses and avoid the
bankruptcies that befell its U.S. rivals last year. The company
was able to develop new models as the U.S. auto market fell to
its lowest level in 27 years in 2009. Ford has said the  debt
load  now puts it at a disadvantage against GM and Chrysler,
which had their obligations cut in bankruptcy.  
 The UAW, GM, Ford and the predecessor of Chrysler Group LLC
agreed in 2007 to create retiree health-care trusts to remove
those liabilities from their labor costs. Prior to the payments
Ford has made, the company owed $13.2 billion to the union-run
health-care trust, also known as a Voluntary Employee
Beneficiary Association, or VEBA. Ford has annual payments
scheduled through June 2022, according to company filings.  
 Ford’s U.S. sales have risen 30.3 percent this year, almost
twice as much the overall gain in industry sales. Chief
Executive Officer  Alan Mulally  expanded the namesake brand and
improved quality, helping the company earn $2.7 billion last
year after three years of losses. Mulally has said the automaker
will be “solidly profitable” this year.
