             Tropical Storm Alex has halted about
25 percent of crude production in the Gulf of Mexico and 9
percent of natural-gas output, the U.S. government said.  
 Oil and gas producers report that three rigs and 28
platforms have been evacuated because of the storm, the Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said
today in a  statement  on its website. Almost 396,000 barrels of
daily oil output remain shut-in, along with 600 million cubic
feet of gas.  
 “Shutting-in oil and gas production is a standard
procedure conducted by industry for safety and environmental
reasons,” the agency, which is part of the U.S. Interior
Department, said in the statement.  
 The Gulf produced 1.6 million barrels of oil and an
estimated 6.4 billion cubic feet of gas a day in March,
according to the agency. The report on shut-in production is
based on responses from 23 companies as of 12:30 p.m. New York
time.  
 The Gulf of Mexico hosts about 31 percent of U.S oil output
and about 10 percent of gas production, according to the Energy
Department.
