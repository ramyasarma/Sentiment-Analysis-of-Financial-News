             Soybeans fell, heading for a second
straight quarterly decline, after a government report showed
U.S. farmers will plant more than forecast, adding to world
inventories.  
 An all-time high 78.868 million acres will be  planted , up
1.8 percent from 77.451 million last year, the USDA said today
in a report based on a survey of farmers. Analysts polled by
Bloomberg News expected 78.161 million acres, on average.
Combined production will rise 37 percent in Brazil and
Argentina, the biggest exporters after the U.S.  
 “The plantings report will be negative for the market as
long as the weather remains favorable” into August when plants
develop pods and begin to fill them with beans, said  Anne Frick ,
the senior commodity analyst for Prudential Bache Commodities
LLC  in New York. “This report means there will be plenty of
supplies.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 3.25 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $9.0875 a bushel at 11:03 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Through yesterday, the most-active contract
dropped 3.1 percent this quarter on forecasts of higher South
American production.  
 The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn, government figures show.
