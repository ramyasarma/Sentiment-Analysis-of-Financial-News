             RBS Securities Inc. lifted its
forecast for Argentine  economic growth  this year to 7 percent
from 4.4 percent, citing the likelihood that President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s administration will fuel consumption
ahead of 2011 elections.  
 “This ‘full throttle’ growth strategy is likely to
exacerbate current distortions in the economy,” RBS economist
 Boris Segura  wrote in a report today from Stamford, Connecticut.
This would leave “a heavy legacy to the next administration,”
Segura said.  
 The new forecast comes after South America’s second-largest
economy expanded at the fastest annual pace since 2008 in the
first quarter, led by an increase in domestic consumption. Gross
domestic product grew 6.8 percent from a year earlier and 3
percent from the last three months of 2009, the National
Statistics Institute said.  
 Segura said inflation is running at 21 percent. According
to government statistics, consumer prices rose 10.7 percent in
May from a year earlier. Prices will rise 26 percent this year
after a 15.3 percent increase in 2009, according to Buenos
Aires-based research company Ecolatina.  
 “Given high  inflation , negative real interest rates and
expectations of subdued exchange rate depreciation, we are of
the view that consumers are just advancing purchases as an
inflation hedge,” Segura said.  
 Fernandez may boost social outlays and pensions, Segura
said. He forecast primary spending to rise about 40 percent by
year end.  
 “This expansionary fiscal policy is a tailwind for
economic activity going forward,” Segura said.
