             U.S. farmers sowed more acres with
spring wheat than last year as rain in the northern Great Plains
encouraged planting even as it interfered with field work, the
Department of Agriculture said.  
 About 13.907 million acres (5.6 million hectares) were
planted with spring varieties, up 4.8 percent from last year and
little changed from a March estimate, the USDA said today in a
report. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 13.721
million acres. As much as four times the normal amount of rain
fell in North Dakota, the biggest producer of U.S. wheat, in
April and May, National Weather Service data show.  
 Spring grains “benefited from abundant rainfall but
developed at a slightly slower-than-normal pace,” the USDA
said.  
 Last year, farmers planted 13.268 million acres with spring
wheat, according to the USDA.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 8 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $4.57 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $4.55, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since June 11. The price has dropped 16 percent this
year, partly on increased stockpiles.  
 Growers planted 2.675 million acres with durum wheat, a
high-protein variety used to make pasta and bread, up from a
March estimate of 2.22 million, the USDA said.  
 U.S. stockpiles of all wheat varieties totaled 973 million
bushels as of June 1, up 48 percent from 657 million a year
earlier, the USDA said in a separate report. Analysts expected
940 million. About 1.36 billion bushels were in storage on March
1, government data show.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
