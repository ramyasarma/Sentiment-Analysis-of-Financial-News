             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,
Asia’s top oil refiner, will increase oil processing at its
 second-biggest refinery  by 1.6 percent next month to meet rising
summer demand.  
 Oil processing volume at the Maoming refinery in the
southern province of Guangdong will rise to 1.05 million metric
tons in July, or 247,258 barrels a day, from 243,333 barrels a
day,  Cai Zhan , the plant’s spokesman, said by mobile phone today.  
 Oil-product demand typically rises in China, the world’s
second-biggest energy user, between July and September as school
holidays prompt increased use of transport fuels including
diesel and gasoline.  
 Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, ran the Maoming plant
at its full capacity of about 270,000 barrels a day in July and
August 2009, Cai said on Aug. 26 last year.  
 Demand isn’t too strong right now as compared with previous
years, Cai said today, without elaborating.
