             Copper, aluminum and zinc are
heading for a quarterly slump on concerns about the strength of
the global economy.  
 Three-month delivery copper gained 0.2 percent to $6,504 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:13 p.m. in
Shanghai and has dropped about 17 percent this quarter.
Aluminum fell 0.2 percent to $1,944 a ton and has tumbled 16
percent this quarter. Zinc rose 1.7 percent to $1,773 a ton,
after plunging 25 percent in the quarter.  
 Stocks  sank from Shanghai to New York, with the MSCI World
Index losing the most in 14 months, and two-year Treasury
yields slid to a record low on concern over weakening growth in
China and a slump in U.S. consumer confidence. Still, copper,
which sets the pace for other industrial metals, is 7.7 percent
up from an eight-month low on June 7.  
 “We think the rebound in copper is over and the metal
will resume a downturn on the faltering economy,” Huang
Hongjun, an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co said from Shenzhen.  
 Japan, Asia’s biggest shipper of copper cathode, may
export 8.5 percent less than previously forecast this year amid
increased domestic demand and slowing Chinese demand growth,
Pan Pacific Copper Co. said. China and the U.S. are the world’s
largest consumers of the metal, used in wires and pipes.  
 Yunnan Copper Industry Co. will close a copper furnace for
maintenance from July 1 to April 1, 2011, the smelter said in
exchange filing yesterday. While the overhaul will reduce the
company’s copper and sulfuric acid production, Yunnan Copper
said its output this year will match the company’s plan.  
 Shanghai copper for October delivery slumped as much as
2.9 percent to 51,250 yuan ($7,547) a ton and closed at 51,800
yuan. Shanghai aluminum dropped 0.6 percent to 14,690 yuan and
zinc fell 1.5 percent to 14,610 yuan.  
 Lead for three-month delivery in London added 0.4 percent
to $1,726.50 a ton, nickel rose 0.8 percent to $19,225 a ton
and tin was unchanged at $17,600 a ton.
