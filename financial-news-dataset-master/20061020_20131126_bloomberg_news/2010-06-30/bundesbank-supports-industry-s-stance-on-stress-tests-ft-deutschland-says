             Bundesbank President  Axel Weber 
supports the German banking industry’s opposition to the “full
and uncontrolled” disclosure of the results of stress tests,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  
 Germany’s largest banks are generally willing to take part
in European stress tests, the Bundesbank and financial regulator
BaFin said as they met with industry leaders yesterday.
