             Chile’s peso declined the most among
emerging market currencies after data showed that industrial
sales expanded less than forecast in May.  
 The peso depreciated 0.5 percent to 547.95 per U.S. dollar
at 10:24 a.m. New York time, from 545.24 yesterday. It earlier
reached 548.75 per dollar, the weakest since June 8.  
 The peso was the worst performer among 26 developing market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the country’s  industrial
sales  rose 0.5 percent in May from a year earlier compared with
the 3.1 percent median  forecast  of five economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Output  expanded 4.2 percent, the National
Statistics Institute said today.  
 “Industrial sales were quite a lot worse than expected,”
said  Luis Morales , a currency trader at BCI Corredor de Bolsa in
Santiago. “But 550 per dollar should be a ceiling in this
session.”  
 Chile’s peso has fallen more against the dollar this
quarter than any other Latin American currency tracked by
Bloomberg, losing 4.3 percent. It’s down 7.4 percent this year.
