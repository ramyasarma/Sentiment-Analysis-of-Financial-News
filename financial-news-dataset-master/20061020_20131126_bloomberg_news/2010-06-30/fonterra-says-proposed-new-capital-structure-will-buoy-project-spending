             Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s largest dairy exporter, will have more to spend on plant
expansion once a new capital structure is approved, according to
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Ferrier.  
 The company expects to spend NZ$500 million ($346 million)
a year in New Zealand on capital projects, Ferrier said in a
speech. Farmer shareholders of the Auckland-based company vote
today on a proposal that will create permanent share capital and
remove the need for the company to set aside capital for
redemptions.
