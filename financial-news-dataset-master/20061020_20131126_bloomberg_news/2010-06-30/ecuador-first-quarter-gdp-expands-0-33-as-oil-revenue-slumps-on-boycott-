             Ecuador’s  gross domestic product 
expanded for a third straight quarter as growth in non-oil
industries helped compensate for the steepest decline in oil
revenue since 2007.  
 GDP expanded 0.33 percent in the first quarter from the
previous three-month period and 0.6 percent from the same period
a  year  earlier, the central bank said in a report published on
its  website .  
 President  Rafael Correa  yesterday said revenue from oil,
which represents about a quarter of the South American country’s
economy, had fallen because private oil companies were holding a
“species of boycott” against the government. Ecuador is
forcing oil companies to renegotiate contracts to give the state
greater control over output. Oil revenue slumped a year-on-year
9.6 percent in the first quarter, while Ecuador’s non-oil sector
expanded 2.39 percent.  
 Central bank President  Diego Borja  last week said the
economy has a “growth problem” and won’t meet the government’s
6.8 percent estimate this year because of lower-than-forecast
public spending. Almost six months into the year, the government
has spent only about 25 percent of its $21.3 billion budget.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold Ecuadorean
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 0.02 percentage
point to 9.98 percentage points as of 10:50 a.m. New York time,
according to JPMorgan’s EMBI+ index. Ecuador’s spread has
widened 2.28 percentage points this year, compared with
0.58 percentage point for the index. Ecuadorean sovereign debt
is the second-riskiest after Venezuela’s among 15 emerging
markets tracked by JPMorgan.
