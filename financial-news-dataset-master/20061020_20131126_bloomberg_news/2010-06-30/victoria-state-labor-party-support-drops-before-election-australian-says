             Support for the incumbent Victoria
state Labor party has dropped, five months before an election,
the Australian newspaper reported, citing a Newspoll opinion
survey. The primary vote for Labor fell to 34 percent, down
three percentage points since the last survey and from 41
percent at the end of 2009, the report said. It’s the lowest
level for a Victorian Labor government since August 1992,
according to the report.
