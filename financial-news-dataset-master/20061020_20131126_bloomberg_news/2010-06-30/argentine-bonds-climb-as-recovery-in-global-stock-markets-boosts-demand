             Argentine bonds slumped for a second
day as a U.S. stock slide prompted investors to sell higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  
 The yield on the country’s 7 percent dollar bonds due in
2015 rose 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage point, to 13.27
percent at 4:22 p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg
pricing. The price fell 0.93 cent to 78.63 cents on the dollar.  
 U.S. stocks fell, extending the first quarterly retreat in
more than a year, after Moody’s Investors Service’s warning that
it may downgrade Spain ended an earlier rally.  
 “Trading continues to be equity driven,” said  Gunter Heiland , an emerging market debt portfolio manager who helps
oversee more than $2.6 billion worth of assets at Greenwich,
Connecticut-based fund Gramercy. “A lot of it still depends on
the news coming out of the euro area.”  
 Gramercy hired Heiland and  Jeffrey Grills  last month to
build four new emerging-market debt portfolios. They began
buying bonds last night, Heiland said.  
 Argentina’s peso was little changed at 3.9305 per dollar,
from 3.931 yesterday. The peso declined for a sixth straight
month, dropping 0.7 percent from the end of May.
