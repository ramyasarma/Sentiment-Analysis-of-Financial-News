             Investec Plc , a South African
private bank, increased the pay of Chief Executive Officer
 Stephen Koseff  by 60 percent last year after profit rebounded.  
 Koseff was paid 2.66 million pounds ($4 million), including
a bonus of 2.25 million pounds, in the year through March,
according to the Johannesburg-based bank’s annual report
published today. His pay was slashed by half to 1.66 million
pounds the previous year, from 3.3 million pounds in 2008.  
 Investec, South Africa’s fifth-largest bank by market
value, reported a 19 percent increase in full-year profit to
346.1 million pounds. The bank, which raised its dividend 23
percent to 16 pence a share, climbed 85 percent in London
trading over the 12 months to March 31.  
 Of Koseff’s bonus, 1.26 million pounds will be deferred and
paid in two equal installments in January 2011 and January 2012.
The same deferral applies to Managing Director  Bernard Kantor ,
who received the same bonus and total remuneration as Koseff in
both fiscal 2010 and 2009.
