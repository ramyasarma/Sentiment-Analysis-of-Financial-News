             Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest maker of luxury cars, may invest more than $1
billion to boost the supply of Mexican auto-parts to its U.S.
plants, Mexican Economy Minister  Gerardo Ruiz Mateos  said.  
 “They want to increase the production of auto parts here
in Mexico,” Ruiz Mateos said in an interview in Bloomberg’s
Mexico City office yesterday. He said he’s going to Germany in
the coming weeks to discuss with BMW.  
 BMW is purchasing more supplies outside Germany as part of
a goal to lower costs by more than 4 billion euros ($4.9
billion) by 2012 and to reduce the impact of foreign currency
swings on earnings. By buying components in Asia and North
America, the company will cut currency risk by 1 billion euros
by 2012,  Herbert Diess , BMW’s purchasing and logistics chief,
said in a May 4 interview.  
 For Mexico, the BMW initiative would help President  Felipe Calderon ’s plan to increase foreign investment at a time when
the country’s share of North American auto production may rise
at a quicker pace as U.S. automakers seek lower labor costs.  
 “BMW has the goal of significantly raising its purchasing
volumes in the NAFTA region, including Mexico, in the coming
years,” said  Mathias Schmidt , a spokesman for BMW in Munich.
The company currently has more than 60 suppliers in the country,
he added.  
 BMW  rose  17 cents, or 0.4 percent, to close at 40.07 euros
in Frankfurt trading. The stock has gained 26 percent this year,
valuing the carmaker at 25.7 billion euros.  
 Chrysler, Ford  
 Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S. automaker run by  Fiat SpA ,
said in February it would invest $550 million to begin producing
the Fiat 500 model at a plant in Toluca, Mexico. Last month,
Ford Motor Co. reopened an assembly plant in Cuautitlan to build
2011 Fiesta cars. The factory will generate 2,000 jobs and is
part of $3 billion in investments announced since 2008.  
 Mexico’s share of North American auto production will rise
to 19 percent over the next decade from an average 12 percent in
2000 to 2009, said  Dennis DesRosiers , president of DesRosiers
Automotive Consulting Inc in Richmond Hill, Ontario.  
 The U.S. is BMW’s second-largest market after Germany. In
the first five months, almost one in every five BMW vehicles was
sold in the U.S.  
 BMW is investing $750 million at its plant in Spartanburg,
South Carolina, to boost capacity by 50 percent. The factory,
which manufactures X3, X5, and X6 sport-utility vehicles as
BMW’s sole U.S. assembly plant, will have capacity to produce
240,000 vehicles a year by 2012.
