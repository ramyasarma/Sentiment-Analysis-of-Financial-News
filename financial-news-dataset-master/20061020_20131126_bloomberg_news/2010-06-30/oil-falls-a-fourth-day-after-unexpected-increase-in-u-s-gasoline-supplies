             Crude oil fell for a fourth day in
New York, the longest losing streak in seven weeks, amid concern
the economic recovery in the U.S. and China will slow, curbing
demand in the world’s two largest energy consumers.  
 Oil dropped 0.4 percent yesterday, capping the first
quarterly decline since 2008, after reports showed a slowdown in
U.S. private payrolls last month and an unexpected increase in
weekly gasoline supplies. China’s manufacturing expanded at a
reduced pace for a second month in June, adding to signs the
fastest-growing major economy is cooling.  
 “Sentiment on the economy can be considered still negative,
not so strong,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity derivatives
sales manager at broker Newedge Group in Tokyo. “The  stock
market  is very weak and that’s helping crude oil to fall.”  
 Oil for August delivery fell as much as $1, or 1.3 percent,
to $74.63 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was at $74.38 at 3:27 p.m. in Singapore.
Yesterday, the contract decreased 31 cents to $75.63. Futures,
down about 6 percent this year, lost 9.7 percent in the second
quarter. The market is in its longest pullback since a six-day
drop through May 18.  
 China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 52.1 from 53.9
in May, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in
an e-mailed statement. This missed a median 53.2 estimate from
12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 U.S. companies in June added the least number of workers
since February, data from ADP Employer Services showed yesterday.
Private payrolls increased 13,000, less than a median estimate
of 60,000 in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. A Labor
Department report tomorrow will probably show June payrolls fell.  
 Recovery Pace  
 “There are a lot of concerns about the pace of the U.S.
economic recovery,” said  David Moore , a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in Sydney. “Sentiment is
still relatively cautious. Some of the U.S. data flow was on the
soft side of expectations.”  
 Gasoline inventories  rose 537,000 barrels to 218.1 million
in the week ended June 25, ending a seven-week gain, according
to an Energy Department report yesterday. Supplies, 3.5 percent
above the five-year average, were forecast to decrease by
400,000 barrels, based on a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  
 Crude stockpiles fell 2 million barrels last week to 363.1
million, partly on reduced imports, the Energy Department said.
Distillate fuel inventories, including heating oil and diesel,
climbed 2.5 million barrels to 159.4 million. That’s the highest
in eight weeks.  
 U.S. fuel consumption  declined  2.7 percent to 19 million
barrels a day, the lowest since April, the report showed.  
 Alex Makes Landfall  
 Alex, the earliest Atlantic hurricane since 1995, has
weakened into a category 1 storm as it moved inland over
northeastern Mexico.  
 Eight rigs and 74 production platforms were evacuated
because of the hurricane, according to the Bureau of Ocean
Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Almost 421,000
barrels a day of oil output were shut in, or 26 percent of Gulf
production, along with 919 million cubic feet of natural-gas
output, or 14 percent.  
 Alex was packing maximum sustained winds of 85 miles (136
kilometers) per hour and moving west at 10 mph, according to a
U.S. National Hurricane Center  advisory  posted at 2 a.m. Miami
time. The center of the storm was about 600 miles from BP Plc’s
leaking Macondo oil well, the source of the worst oil spill in
U.S. history, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Brent crude for August delivery fell as much as $1.45, or
1.9 percent, to $73.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It was at $73.71 at 3:28 p.m. Singapore time.
Yesterday, the contract declined 43 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $75.01.
