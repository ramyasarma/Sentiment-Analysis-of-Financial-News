             The rate that banks say they charge
each other for three-month loans in euros rose by the most since
October 2008, according to the British Bankers’ Association.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
rose by almost two basis points to 0.706 percent, the highest
since Sept. 30, 2009, the BBA said. The rate was 0.688 percent
yesterday. The euro Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’
reluctance to lend, narrowed two basis points to 21.5 basis
points as of 11:47 a.m. in London.  
 Three-month dollar Libor was little changed at 0.534
percent.
