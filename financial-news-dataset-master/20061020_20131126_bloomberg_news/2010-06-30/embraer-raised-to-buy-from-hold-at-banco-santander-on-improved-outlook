             Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA
was raised to “buy” from “hold” by Banco Santander SA
analyst Caio Dias, who said shares of Embraer, as the company is
known, doesn’t fully reflect the improved outlook for the
commercial jet, business jet and defense markets.  
 Embraer’s American depository receipts may rise to $29 next
year, according to the brokerage, compared with a 2010 forecast
of $24.
