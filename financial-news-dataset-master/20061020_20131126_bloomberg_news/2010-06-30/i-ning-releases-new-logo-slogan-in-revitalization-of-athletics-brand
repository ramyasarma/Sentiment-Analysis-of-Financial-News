             Li Ning Co. , the Chinese sportswear
maker endorsed by basketball star  Shaquille O’Neal , today said
it has changed its logo and slogan as part of a brand
“revitalization.”  
 The new logo, which is based on the original wavy-line
design, displays a resemblance to the Chinese character for
“people,” according to an exchange filing. The company also
changed its slogan to “Make The Change,” from “Anything is
Possible,” it said.  
 “The new design and slogan are part of Li Ning’s business
target to differentiate itself from its peers, including Nike,”
said  Billy Chen , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Core Pacific-
Yamaichi International. “The company is also attempting to
boost its brand value.”
