             Boeing Co.  agreed to buy defense
contractor  Argon ST Inc.  in a deal valued at about $775 million,
expanding the planemaker’s reach into the market for military
electronics.  
 The offer is for $34.50 a share in cash, or 41 percent more
than Argon ST’s closing price yesterday of $24.43 a share,
according to statements today from the Fairfax, Virginia-based
company and from  Boeing . The companies said the transaction
value was “net of cash acquired.”  
 Boeing’s “willingness to spend $775 million could indicate
confidence” that the company’s business is improving,  Sam Pearlstein , an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities in New York,
said in a note.  
 Argon ST supplies the U.S. military with equipment to
locate and analyze electronic communication signals. The company
expressed interest in “strategic alternatives” in January,
saying it was considering mergers, acquisitions or a sale of
itself.  
 Boeing is paying about 1.9 times Argon ST’s projected 2011
sales,  Peter Arment , an analyst at Gleacher & Co. in Greenwich,
Connecticut, said in an e-mail. Argon ST has “good positions”
in the military market for command and control, cyber security
and intelligence analysis, said Arment, who like Pearlstein
recommends buying Boeing shares.  
 The sale should close by the end of the third quarter,
Boeing said.  
 Boeing fell 29 cents to $62.75 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading , while  Argon ST  rose $9.86, or 40
percent, to $34.29 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  
 1,000 Employees  
 Argon ST has about 1,000 employees, said David Sidman, a
spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing. Argon ST Chief Executive
Officer  Terry Collins  will continue to lead Argon ST as a stand-
alone unit within Boeing, according to the companies.  
 “Combining the strength of Boeing with the experience of
Argon ST will significantly accelerate our capabilities in
sensors, communications technologies and information
management,”  Dennis Muilenburg , chief executive officer of
Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in the statement.  
 Boeing’s military business includes making aircraft as well
as electronics and missile defense systems, generating sales of
$33.7 billion in 2009. Counting civilian and military aircraft,
the company is the world’s largest planemaker and had revenue
totaling $68.3 billion last year.  
 With 21.9 million shares outstanding as of April 30, Argon
ST had a market value of $535 million based on yesterday’s
closing price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net
income  for the year ended in September was $23.7 million on
sales of $366 million.
