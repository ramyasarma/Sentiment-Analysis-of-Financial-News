             BRF - Brasil Foods SA , the world’s
largest poultry exporter, plunged the most in six weeks after a
government agency recommended it sell assets before winning
antitrust approval for the takeover of its biggest rival.  
 Brasil Foods, formerly known as Perdigao SA, fell 1.13
reais, or 4.5 percent, to 24.17 reais at 10:55 a.m. in Sao Paulo
trading. The stock earlier fell as much as 6 percent, the
biggest drop since May 20.  
 The antitrust arm of Brazil’s Finance Ministry recommended
that antitrust regulator Cade require Brasil Foods to license
one of its two principal brands or sell a block of assets before
granting approval of the takeover of Sadia SA.  
 The ministry agency, known as SEAE, said in its report
yesterday that there is “significant concentration´´ in the
fresh beef and industrialized products markets, as well as the
slaughtering of poultry and turkey in some Brazilian states
because of the deal.  
 Perdigao SA agreed to buy rival Sadia last year to form
Brasil Foods after the smaller rival booked more than 3 billion
reais ($1.67 billion) in derivatives losses in 2008.
