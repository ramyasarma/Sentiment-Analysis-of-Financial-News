             Greek bonds are poised to fall
because they will be removed from sovereign debt indexes after
the month ends, cutting demand from investors who use the
benchmarks as a guide to allocating funds, UBS AG said.  
 Greece will be dropped from the gauges after Moody’s
Investors Service cut its rating on the nation to less than
investment grade this month, said UBS, the world’s second-
largest currency trader, in a report.  
 “Managers are expected to sell Greek bonds and re-allocate
among other euro-zone sovereign bonds as a result, which should
unsurprisingly put upward pressure on Greek yields,”  Brian Kim ,
a currency strategist for the company in Stamford, Connecticut,
wrote to clients. Money managers may reinvest funds in German,
French or Italian debt, UBS said.  
 The yield on Greece’s 6.25 percent bond due in June 2020
has climbed to 10.45 percent from 6.53 percent at the end of
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
to 74.569 from 97.899.  
 Greek 10-year  yields  climbed to a record 12.47 percent in
May as the government struggled to reduce its budget deficit.
