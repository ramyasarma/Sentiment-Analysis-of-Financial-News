             Global production of wood pellets,
an alternative fuel for heating, will grow by multiples over the
next decade, helped by the European Union’s renewable energy
regulations, an industry lobby group said.  
 Production will increase to 100 million tons from about 12
million tons now, Christian Rakos, head of the association of
Austrian pellet producers, said today in Brussels. Much of the
increase will come from Canada and the southern U.S.  
 The EU aims to boost the use of renewable energy to 20
percent of the region’s total by 2020, with almost two-thirds of
that coming from plant-based biofuels, pellets and biomass,
Rakos said. Pellets are made by compressing sawdust and chips
from pulp and paper production.  
 Europe is currently the biggest producer and consumer of
wood pellets with companies including Sweden’s Vapo Group among
the largest producers.
