             U.K. stocks dropped, with the
benchmark FTSE 100 Index falling to a ten-month low, after
China’s manufacturing growth slowed and Moody’s Investors
Service said it may cut Spain’s top credit rating.  
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Barclays Plc dropped more than 4
percent, leading shares lower on the FTSE 100.  Chloride Group
Plc  declined 4.1 percent after ABB Ltd. abandoned its pursuit of
the London-listed maker of power-protection gear.  
 The  FTSE 100  lost 111.12, or 2.3 percent, to 4,805.75,
extending its loss for the year to 11 percent. The  FTSE All-
Share Index  retreated 2.3 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index 
declined 2.9 percent.  
 About $400 billion has been wiped off the value of U.K.
stocks this year amid concern that measures to reduce the
deficits of some European countries may curb the recovery and as
China moved to restrict growth in the world’s largest emerging
economy to tame inflation. The FTSE 100 has declined 11 percent
this year and is 18 percent lower than its 2010 high reached on
April 15.  
 Investors “are fleeing risk,” said  Joshua Raymond , a
markets strategist at City Index Ltd. in London. They “are now
fearing that slowing growth in China could impact on metal
demand and company earnings.”  
 The Chinese government’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to
a lower-than-forecast 52.1 in June from 53.9 in May. A reading
of above 50 signals expansion.  
 Fiscal Challenges  
 Spain’s Aaa credit ranking was placed on review for a
possible downgrade by Moody’s.  
 “Deteriorating” growth prospects and challenges in
meeting fiscal targets mean Spain’s top classification may be
lowered by as much as two grades, Moody’s analysts including
Senior Vice President  Kristin Lindow  in New York said yesterday
in a statement. The review will be concluded within a three-
month period, the ratings company said.  
 Spain sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of five-year
debt today, reaching its maximum target set in the auction, the
Bank of Spain said. Demand was 1.7 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.35 times at the last auction on May 6. The notes
were sold at an average yield of 3.657 percent compared with
3.532 percent at an auction of the same notes on May 6.  
 Banks Decline  
 Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, dropped 5.6 percent
to 255.35 pence. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc declined 4.7
percent to 39.47 pence.  
 Shell, Europe’s largest oil producer, retreated 4.5 percent
to 1,624 pence as crude oil fell for a fourth day in New York,
its longest losing streak in seven weeks.  
 Chloride  sank 4.1 percent to 370.1 pence. ABB Ltd., the
world’s biggest supplier of power grids, abandoned its pursuit
of Chloride, deciding not to escalate a bidding contest with
Emerson Electric Co. Chloride said it will discuss with Emerson
its offer announced on June 29.  
 Wellstream Holdings Plc  slumped 13 percent to 440 pence.
The oilfield-services provider said a predicted recovery in the
second half “looks to be slower” than expected because of
“recent events in the Gulf of Mexico.” The company said some
profit may be “delayed” into 2011, according to a statement
today.  
 BP Plc climbed 2.8 percent to 327.95 pence. Sky News
reported the European oil producer, battling to stop a leaking
oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, is in talks with China National
Offshore Oil Corp. regarding the sale of its 6 billion-pound
($9.1 billion) interests in Argentina.  
 Separately, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts said
BP’s first relief well for the leak may be completed in the
first half of July, ahead of the company’s indicated schedule.
The stock has fallen 49 percent since April 20 when an oil rig
explosion triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history.  
 Debenhams Plc soared 4 percent to 55.1 pence as the U.K.’s
second-largest department-store company said gross profit
margins for the year will exceed a previous forecast for a 0.8
percentage-point gain.  
 Tate & Lyle Plc  climbed 1.1 percent to 454.4 pence. The
maker of low-calorie sweetener Splenda plans to sell its sugars
division to American Sugar Refining Inc. for 211 million pounds.
