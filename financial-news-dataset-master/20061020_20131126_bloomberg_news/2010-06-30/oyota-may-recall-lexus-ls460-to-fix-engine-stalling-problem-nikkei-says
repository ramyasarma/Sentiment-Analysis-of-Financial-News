             Toyota Motor Corp. may recall the
Lexus LS460 sedan because the engine may stall while the vehicle
is running, Nikkei English News reported, without saying where
it got the information.  
 The company reportedly hasn’t received any reports of
accidents, Nikkei said. Tens of thousands of sedans may be part
of a worldwide recall, Nikkei said.
