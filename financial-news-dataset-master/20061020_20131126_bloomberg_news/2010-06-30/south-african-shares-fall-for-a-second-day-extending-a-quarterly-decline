             South Africa’s  FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index  fell for a second day, sliding 439.88, or 1.7
percent, to 26,258.82. The measure lost 8.7 percent this
quarter, the first quarterly decline since March 2009.  
 The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  
 Anglo Platinum Ltd.  (AMS SJ), the world’s biggest platinum
producer fell for a second day, losing 16 rand, or 2.2 percent,
to 729 rand.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.  (IMP SJ), the second-
largest, dropped 4 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 180 rand. The metal
used in clean-emissions technology by carmakers retreated for a
third day, sliding as much as 1.6 percent to $1,518.65 an ounce.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd.  (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, slumped 5.03 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 200.86 rand,
extending yesterday’s 3.9 percent drop.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL
SJ) retreated 8.01 rand, or 2.9 percent, to 268.99 rand. Copper
extended its biggest quarterly decline since 2008 in New York
and London after a U.S. jobs report showed employers added fewer
jobs than economists forecast, adding to concern that demand may
slow.  
 Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd.  (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-
largest producer of the metal, increased 1.90 rand, or 2.4
percent, to 81.40 rand, the highest since Dec. 4. Gold rose for
a second day as signs of a struggling U.S. labor market stoked
demand for bullion as a means of protecting wealth amid economic
uncertainties.  
 Naspers Ltd.  (NPN SJ) gained for the first time in five
days, climbing 2 rand, or 0.8 percent, to 259.90 rand. Investec
equity analyst  Jonathan Kennedy-Good  raised his recommendation
on Africa’s biggest media company to “buy” from “hold,” with
a 12-month target estimate of 360 rand per share.  
 Pan African Resources Plc  (PAN SJ) advanced 4 cents, or 5.5
percent, to 77 cents after dropping 5.2 percent yesterday. The
gold exploration and production company said that a “major zone
of gold mineralization” was defined at its Royal Sheba prospect
and it has identified “several zones” at its Barberton Mines
(Pty) Ltd.
