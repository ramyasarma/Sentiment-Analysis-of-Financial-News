             U.S. customs officials began closing
Web sites that offer pirated movies, fulfilling a promise to
crack down on illegal downloads that Hollywood executives say
cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion a year.  
 The Homeland Security Department’s Immigration and Customs
Enforcement arm announced  Operation  In Our Sites today at  Walt
Disney Studios  in Burbank, California. Federal agents seized
nine website domain names, and assets from 15 bank, Paypal,
investment and advertising accounts. They also served search
warrants on four residences.  
 Greater enforcement is a lobbying priority for the
entertainment industry, which has lost sales as consumers gain
access to free music and movies on the Web. The administration
of President Barack Obama is intensifying efforts to rein in
pirated movies and music, Victoria Espinel, the U.S.
intellectual property enforcement officer, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee on June 23, vowing to shut non-U.S. sites.  
 “We will go after the foreign-based websites and Web
services that infringe our intellectual property rights,”
Espinel told the panel.  
 The U.S. sought search warrants to retrieve data from the
hard drives of servers in the U.S. that are used to deliver
movies, a government employee with knowledge of the operation
said before the announcement. Sites located off U.S. shores were
to be blocked, with users re-directed to a U.S. government site,
said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on
pending enforcement actions.  
 Domain Names  
 The targeted domain names include TVshack.net, movies-
links.tv, now-movies.com, planetmoviez.com and filespump.com,
according to a statement from Immigration and Customs.  
 Cases are expected to be referred to the U.S. Attorney’s
office in southern New York and to another unidentified office,
the person said.  
 Motion picture piracy costs the U.S. economy more than $20
billion annually,  Barry Meyer , chief executive officer of  Time
Warner Inc.’s  Warner Brothers unit, said in written testimony at
the hearing. He estimated that there were more than 1.78 million
illegal downloads of “Sherlock Holmes,” which starred  Robert Downey Jr ., in the 30 days following its December release.  
 The Hollywood crackdown is part of a larger push to halt
traffic in pirated and counterfeit goods, including
pharmaceuticals and software, that Espinel outlined in her
testimony.  
 The federal action was announced by John Morton,
Immigration & Customs assistant secretary, along with Walt
Disney Studios President Alan Bergman and Frederick Huntsberry,
chief operating officer at Paramount Pictures, a unit of New
York-based  Viacom Inc.  Also attending were members of Directors
Guild of America and other trade unions who argue that piracy
harms jobs.  
 Walt Disney Co., the world’s largest media company, lost 33
cents to $31.97 at 2:29 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Viacom, controlled by  Sumner Redstone , fell
38 cents to $31.69.
