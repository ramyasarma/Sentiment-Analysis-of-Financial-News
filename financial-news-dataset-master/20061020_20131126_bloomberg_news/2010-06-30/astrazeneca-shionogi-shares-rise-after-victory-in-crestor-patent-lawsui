             AstraZeneca Plc  surged to the
highest level in more than three years in London trading after a
U.S. court upheld a patent on the Crestor cholesterol pill,
removing a threat to the blockbuster’s $4.5 billion in sales.  
 AstraZeneca’s stock gained 7.5 percent today after U.S.
District Judge  Joseph J. Farnan Jr . ruled yesterday that a
patent on the active ingredient in Crestor is valid and
enforceable until 2016. AstraZeneca’s partner Shionogi & Co.
rose 7.2 percent in Tokyo trading.  
 The victory may clear the way for London-based AstraZeneca
to increase share repurchases or pay a special dividend with its
$9.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, said  Gareth Powell , who helps manage $200 million in health-care funds at
Polar Capital. The company may announce next month when it
releases earnings that it’s increasing stock repurchases to as
much as $4 billion annually from about $1 billion now that it
has won the case, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  Alexandra Hauber  wrote
in a note to clients today.  
 “If it had gone the wrong way, it would have been an
absolute nightmare,” Powell said in an interview in London.
“The implications now are, what will they do with all the
cash?” Powell, who doesn’t own AstraZeneca shares, said he will
assess his position after “the stock settles down.”  
 AstraZeneca rose 222 pence, or 7.5 percent, to 3,169 pence,
the highest price since Nov. 7, 2006. It was the biggest advance
since Nov. 24, 2008.  
 Generic Competition  
 The company still faces cheaper copies of six drugs by
2014, including its two biggest sellers: Nexium for ulcers and
the Seroquel antipsychotic. Chief Executive Officer David
Brennan has said that the threats may result in “fluctuating
earnings” until 2014 and that investors should instead focus on
his efforts to return cash to them.  
 AstraZeneca repurchased more than $4.7 billion of shares in
2007 and 2008, yet halted buybacks in the third quarter of 2008
to conserve cash during the financial crisis. The company
resumed buybacks this year and plans to spend as much as $1
billion.  
 “With the Crestor overhang and risk of significant
downside removed, investment focus should shift to the potential
upside from a buyback program,” Hauber wrote. A $4 billion
annual buyback would push earnings per share up by 20 percent by
2014, she wrote. The company may signal an increased
repurchasing plan when it announces earnings on July 29, wrote
Hauber, who  raised  AstraZeneca shares to “neutral” from
“underweight.”  
 Shionogi Rises  
 “We wouldn’t say anything prior to our half-year results”
about buyback or dividend plans, AstraZeneca spokesman  Chris Sampson  said in an interview. “People will just have to wait.”  
 Shionogi climbed 124 yen, or 7.2 percent, to close at 1,843
yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the most since Nov. 10, 2008.
Crestor brought $565 million in royalty revenue to Shionogi in
the year ended March 31, or 18 percent of sales. The dispute had
been capping Shionogi shares, which have fallen 8.3 percent this
year, said  Mayo Mita , an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo.  
 Shionogi shares may reach 2,200 yen in the next 12 months,
said  Fumiyoshi Sakai , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, in a
note to clients.  
 The judge in Wilmington, Delaware, rejected challenges by
companies including  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  that
sought to market copies of the medicine.  
 AstraZeneca also faces a review by a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel on July 28 of its experimental
anti-clotting treatment Brilinta that “may cause further
volatility,” Hauber wrote.  
 “Brilinta is very important to think about now as the next
key binary event,” Powell said. “It really is the key thing
for investors now. It’s much more important longer-term.”
