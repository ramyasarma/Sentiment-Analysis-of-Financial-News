             Public school systems in the U.S.
spent the most per student on education in 2008 in at least 16
years, after adjusting for inflation, according to an analysis
of U.S. Census data by Bloomberg.  
 The average spending per pupil was $10,259, a 6.1 percent
increase over the previous year, according to a U.S. Census
Bureau  report  released on June 28. That’s the biggest spending
increase since at least 1992, the earliest year for which data
was immediately available, when adjusted for inflation in 2009
dollars, the Bloomberg analysis found. New York spent the most,
laying out $17,173 per pupil, according to the census report.
Utah spent the least per student, just $5,765.  
 The data don’t reflect recent budget cuts affecting school
systems around the U.S. after the nation’s worst recession since
the Great Depression. U.S. Education Secretary  Arne Duncan  and
the Obama administration are prodding Congress to pass the
“Keep Our Educators Working Act,” a  bill that would add $23
billion in funding intended to save 100,000 to 300,000 jobs for
teachers and other school personnel.  
 “The census report reflects the good times before the
recession kicked in,” said  Jack Jennings , president of the
 Center on Education Policy , a Washington-based nonpartisan and
nonprofit group. “That’s the most spending per student on
education that we’ll see in a while.”  
 The policy group is getting ready to release its own survey
that shows most school districts reported a decline in funding
in 2009 and 2010 and expect to have less in 2011, Jennings said.  
 Spending Matters  
 How much states spend per student is influenced by economic
activity, tax rates and the cost of labor and materials,
Jennings said. Higher spending levels can mean better facilities
and better-paid, higher quality teachers if administrators and
instructors are held accountable, he said.  
 “School quality isn’t just about money, but money
certainly helps,” Jennings said.  
 After New York, the school systems that spent the most on
education were New Jersey ($16,491); Alaska ($14,630); the
District of Columbia ($14,594); Vermont ($14,300); and
Connecticut ($13,848). After Utah, the states who paid the least
per student were Idaho ($6,931), Arizona ($7,608); and Oklahoma
($7,685) and Tennessee ($7,739).  
 Public education is the single largest category of state
and local government expenditures, said Lisa Blumerman, chief of
the governments division at the U.S. Census Bureau, in a
statement. Teacher salaries make up the largest spending
category for public elementary and secondary education, totaling
$203.5 billion in 2008. The data used for the study came from a
survey of all 15,569 public school districts.
