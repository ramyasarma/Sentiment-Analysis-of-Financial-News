             Shire Plc  overstates the benefits of
Intuniv, its drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
in children, in promotional materials, U.S. regulators said.  
 Brochures in a patient starter kit for the drug make
“unsubstantiated effectiveness claims” and “omit and minimize
important risk information,” the Food and Drug Administration
said in a June 22  letter  to the company posted today on the
agency’s website.  
 Shire won FDA approval in September to sell the once-daily
extended-release tablets to treat the attention disorder in
children and adolescents. The Dublin-based company has been
betting on Intuniv and Vyvanse, the successor to Shire’s
Adderall treatment for hyperactivity, to counter losses after
generic versions of Adderall reached the market in April.
Intuniv, whose chemical name is guanfacine hydrochloride,
brought in $5.4 million in  sales  last year, Shire said in a
statement.  
 Clinical studies don’t support the company’s claims that
the drug improves “individual behavioral problems” such as
“bedtime blowups,” “homework hassles” and “mall
meltdowns,” the FDA said.  
 The promotional materials cited in the agency’s letter have
been “removed from the field,”  Matt Cabrey , a U.S. spokesman
for Shire, said today in a telephone interview.  
 “This is something we take very seriously, and we are now
reviewing the information and working closely with the FDA in
order to update the materials with the correct information,”
Cabrey said.
