             Japanese  stocks  plunged, extending a
global rout and sending benchmark indexes to their lowest levels
in seven months, as a slump in U.S. consumer confidence fueled
concern about the prospects for a global economic recovery.  
 Canon Inc. , a camera maker that counts Europe as its
biggest market, sank 1.9 percent as the dollar and euro weakened
against the yen. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest commodities
trader, lost 1.9 percent after oil and metal prices slumped.
Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., the world’s biggest maker of silicon for
semiconductors, lost 4 percent, leading chip shares lower after
Mizuho Securities Co. cut its investment rating.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 2 percent to 9,382.64 at
close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index dropped for a seventh
consecutive day, losing 1.3 percent to 841.42 as almost five
times as many stocks declined as advanced. Both gauges retreated
to their lowest closing levels since Nov. 30.  
 “The view is spreading among investors that a recovery in
the global economy won’t be as easy as people had expected,”
said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $65 billion. “Moves
by countries around the world to tighten fiscal policies are
behind the plunge in markets.”  
 The Topix has slumped 16 percent from its high this year on
April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and Chinese steps to
curb property prices will hurt global growth. The retreat has
widened the index’s drop this year to 7.3 percent and cut the
price of stocks in the gauge to 16.4 times  estimated earnings ,
the lowest level since December 2008.  
 China, U.S. Confidence  
 The Nikkei 225 declined the most today among benchmark
indexes in the Asia-Pacific region. This  quarter  the gauge lost
15 percent and the Topix declined 14 percent, their biggest
drops since the quarter ended December 2008, immediately
following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  in the U.S.
climbed 0.4 percent today. In New York yesterday, the gauge
retreated 3.1 percent to its lowest level since Oct. 30 after
the New York-based Conference Board cut its estimate for Chinese
economic growth.  
 The private research group also said yesterday that its
index of U.S. consumer confidence slumped to 52.9 this month,
below the lowest forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, from a revised 62.7 in May.  
 “Investors are getting excessively anxious about the
future of the global economy,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities
manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  
 Yen, Commodities  
 Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent
of its sales abroad, lost 1.9 percent to 2,597 yen and Canon
dropped 1.9 percent to 3,330 yen. They were the  heaviest drags 
on the Topix.  
 Sony Corp., an electronics maker that gets about 70 percent
of its revenue from outside Japan, slumped 1.9 percent to 2,383
yen. Fanuc Ltd., a maker of industrial robots, retreated 2.2
percent to 10,140 yen. Electronics makers were the biggest drag
on the Topix among its 33 industry groups.  
 The yen appreciated against the euro to as much as 107.69
today from 108.82 at yesterday’s close of stock trading in Tokyo.
Against the dollar, it strengthened to as much as 88.39 from
88.76. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas income for
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  
 Mitsubishi Corp. declined 1.9 percent to 1,864 yen. Mitsui
& Co., a trading company that counts commodities as its biggest
source of profit, slid 2 percent to 1,054 yen. The company also
had its credit outlook cut to “negative” from “stable” by
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.  
 Oil, Metals Decline  
 Crude oil for August delivery dropped for a third day today.
It fell 3 percent yesterday in New York to settle at $75.94 a
barrel, the biggest one-day drop since June 4. The  London Metal
Exchange Index  of six metals including aluminum and copper
tumbled 5.5 percent yesterday, its largest slide since May 17.
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials tumbled 2.8
percent, the most since Aug. 14. Only gold climbed.  
 Chip-related shares retreated today, led by  Shin-Etsu
Chemical  after Mizuho Securities Co. cut its investment rating
on the maker of wafers for semiconductors to “neutral” from
“outperform.” The stock sank 4 percent to 4,175 yen. Sumco
Corp., a competitor, lost 1.9 percent to 1,489 yen. Tokyo
Electron Co., the world’s second-biggest maker of semiconductor
equipment, declined 3.1 percent to 4,855 yen.  
 Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S. maker of computer
memory, fell the most in 19 months yesterday on concern it has
too many unsold chips and that output of other products isn’t
increasing fast enough. The stock plunged 13 percent, the
biggest retreat in the S&P 500.  
 Shionogi & Co. soared 7.2 percent to 1,843 yen today, the
drugmaker’s sharpest gain since November 2008. Its partner
AstraZeneca Plc won a U.S. court ruling that will help prevent
generic-drug makers from selling lower-cost copies of their
Crestor cholesterol pill until 2016. Shionogi climbed the most
in the Nikkei 225 and was the gauge’s biggest support.
