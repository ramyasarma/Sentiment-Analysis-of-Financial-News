             Besix Group, the Belgian contractor
that helped build the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, won a $750
million contract in a joint venture to build the third phase of
the New Doha International Airport passenger terminal complex.  
 The project, to be built with Midmac Contracting, is set
for completion by the fourth quarter of 2012,  Orascom
Construction Industries , which owns 50 percent of Besix Group,
said in a statement today on its  website .  
 The builders will be responsible for all structural,
mechanical and electrical works as well as the design of the
airport lounge and retail area, according to the statement.
Besix’s share of the contract is about 50 percent of its value,
the statement said.  
 Orascom Construction, Egypt’s biggest publicly traded
builder, closed 1.85 percent down at 227.44 Egyptian pounds
($39.93) today in Cairo, before the announcement, valuing the
company at 47 billion pounds according to  Bloomberg data .  
 Orascom said in June that Besix won a $265 million contract
for the North Manama causeway in Bahrain as part of a joint
venture with the Haji Hassan Group.  
 Orascom operates in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and
Asia. The company announced a joint venture in January with
Morgan Stanley to invest in infrastructure in the Middle East
and Africa.
