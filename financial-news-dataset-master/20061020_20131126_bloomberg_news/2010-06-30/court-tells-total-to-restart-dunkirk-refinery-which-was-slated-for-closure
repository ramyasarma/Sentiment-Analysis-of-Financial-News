             A French court has ordered Total SA
to restart its Dunkirk refinery, which the company plans to
close, a Confederation Generale du Travail labor union official
said.  
 The decision by the Douai, northern France, court is a
“big victory” for workers protesting the closure, CGT official
Charles Foulard said in a telephone interview today.
