             China’s benchmark  stock index  dropped
for a seventh day, the longest losing streak in 18 months, as a
bigger-than-expected slowdown in the country’s manufacturing
last month added to evidence the economy is cooling.  
 Jiangxi Copper Co.  and Shenhua Energy Co. paced losses by
commodity producers as metal and oil prices declined. Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd., the nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal, slid 2.8 percent after cutting the price of
alumina. Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. fell among health-care
companies on concern valuations are excessive.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index  retreated 24.58, or 1 percent,
to close at 2,373.79, the lowest since April 8, 2009. The seven-
day decline is the longest since an eight-day slump that ended
Dec. 31, 2008. The  CSI 300 Index  slid 1.4 percent to 2,526.07.  
 “The latest indicators are pointing to a slowdown
in the economy,” said  Zhang Ling , a fund manager at
Shanghai River Fund Management Co. “The correction is far
from over.”  
 The Shanghai Composite tumbled 23 percent last quarter,
capping the  biggest loss  since the three months to March 2008,
as policy makers tightened rules for the property market and
concern grew that Europe’s austerity measures will hurt demand
in China’s largest export destination. The equity index is the
world’s third-worst performer this year, down 28 percent.  
 The government’s Purchasing Managers’ Index declined for a
second month, falling to 52.1 from 53.9 in May. That was less
than the median 53.2 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 12
economists. An HSBC Holdings Plc manufacturing index slid to a
14-month low.  
 ‘Steady Moderation’  
 Zhang Liqun , a researcher for the Chinese cabinet, said the
manufacturing data indicates a “steady moderation” to a more
sustainable pace of growth after an 11.9 percent expansion in
the first quarter.  
 Jiangxi Copper, the biggest producer of the metal, lost 2.6
percent to 23.44 yuan, capping a 42 percent drop this year.
Shenhua, the largest coal producer, retreated 1.1 percent to
21.73 yuan.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. , the listed unit of the
fourth-biggest coal miner, slipped 3.8 percent to 15.80 yuan.  
 Oil for August delivery fell as much as 1.9 percent to
$74.21 a barrel in electronic trading in New York, a fourth day
of declines. Three-month delivery copper fell as much as 1.8
percent in London today. Aluminum declined 1.6 percent and zinc
lost 2 percent.  
 Aluminum Corp. of China, better known as Chalco, slumped
2.8 percent to 8.91 yuan, the lowest since March 2009. The
company said it cut the spot price for alumina by 7 percent, the
Beijing-based company said today.  
 Slower Demand  
 Economic growth is moderating, a rebound in exports is
weakening, and slower domestic demand is leading to a build-up
of finished-goods inventories, said the logistics federation,
which released the government’s PMI. Industrial production is
entering a “light season” and the output of heavy energy users
such as metal and oil processers contracted last month, it said.  
 Investors are growing jittery about signs of a slowdown in
China. A downward revision by the Conference Board on its April
economic outlook for China contributed to a 4.3 percent plunge
on the Shanghai Composite on June 29.  
 Still, Citic Securities Co. strategists led by Yu Jun said
the benchmark gauge may climb above 3,000 points in the second
half as slowing inflation and a decline in home prices ease
investor concerns of further tightening measures.  
 The brokerage recommended investors buy shares of insurers,
banks, property developers, agriculture producers and machinery
and home-appliance makers.  
 A gauge tracking health-care stocks slid 3.4 percent,
sending its price-earnings ratio to 22 times. The decline was
the most among the 10 industry groups on the CSI 300 Index,
which trades at 16.9  times  reported earnings after a 29 percent
loss this year.  
 Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine retreated 5.4 percent to 36.95
yuan. Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment Co. slid 5 percent to
33.53 yuan, paring an annual rally to 57 percent.  
 “Investors gave a high premium to pharmaceutical stocks to
reflect their defensive nature,” said  Wu Kan , a Shanghai-based
fund manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “As most sectors become cheaper after the decline on
the broader market, investors are now considering rerating
valuations of pharmaceutical stocks.”  
 The following companies were among the most active in
China’s markets. Stock symbols are in brackets after companies’
names.  
      Bright Oceans Inter-Telecom Corp.  (600289 CH) gained 7.1
percent to 9.33 yuan, the most since March 5, after the company
said International Business Machines Corp. bought 5.92 million
of its shares for 50 million yuan.  
 Chongqing Water Group Co.  (601158 CH), a Chinese water-
treatment company, dropped 3.9 percent to 6.90 yuan, extending
yesterday’s 10 percent slump after 225 million of its shares
became tradable yesterday.  
      Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery Co.  (002126 CH), a maker of auto
parts, surged by the 10 percent daily limit to 20.05 yuan.
First-half profit likely rose by between 210 percent and 260
percent from a year earlier, compared with the previous
prediction for a gain of 130 percent to 180 percent, according
to a company statement dated today.
