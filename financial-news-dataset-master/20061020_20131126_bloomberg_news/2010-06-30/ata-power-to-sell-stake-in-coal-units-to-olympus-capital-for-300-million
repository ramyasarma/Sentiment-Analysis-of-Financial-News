             Tata Power Ltd. , India’s largest
non-state generator, will raise $300 million by selling stakes
in two units that own Indonesian coal mines to  Olympus Capital
Holdings Asia  to pay for securing more supplies and reduce debt.  
 Olympus Capital , a Hong Kong private-equity firm with $1.2
billion under management, will own as much as 15 percent in Tata
Power units Bhira Investments Ltd. and Bhivpuri Investments Ltd.
once the transaction is complete, Tata Power said in a statement.  
 Tata Power plans to increase its coal imports to 22 million
metric tons a year by 2014, J.K. Niyogi, head of international
operations, said June 1. The company has secured 12 million tons
of coal from Indonesia to meet its demand and will seek more
from the nation and South Africa, Niyogi said.  
 The company agreed to pay $1.3 billion in March 2007 to buy
a 30 percent stake in coal mining units PT Kaltim Prima Coal and
PT Arutmin Indonesia owned by PT Bumi Resources.
