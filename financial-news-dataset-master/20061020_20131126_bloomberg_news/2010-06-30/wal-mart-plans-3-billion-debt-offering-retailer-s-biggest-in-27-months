             Wal-Mart Stores Inc ., the world’s
largest retailer, plans to sell $3 billion of debt in its
biggest dollar-denominated bond transaction since April 2008.  
 The offering consists of $750 million of 5-year notes, $1.5
billion of 10-year bonds and $750 million of 30-year securities,
 Greg Rossiter , a company spokesman, said today by telephone from
Bentonville, Arkansas. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, he said.  
 Wal-Mart is tapping the U.S. debt market for a second time
this year, after issuing $2 billion of bonds in March, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based
retailer may be raising capital to fund share repurchases,  Carol Levenson , director of research at Gimme Credit LLC, said in a
note today.  
 The company “is a rarity among retailers by virtue of its
extremely high and stable credit quality and financial
flexibility,” Levenson wrote. “It does take some nerve to
launch a corporate bond amid the current volatile markets, but
who better than Wal-Mart to test the waters?”  
 The 5-year debt may yield 53 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the 10-year notes may yield 70
basis points more than benchmarks, and 30-year bonds may pay a
spread of 108 basis points, according to a person familiar with
the offering who declined to be identified because the terms
aren’t set.  
 Stock Buyback Plans  
 Wal-Mart, which operates in 15 countries, announced a $15
billion share buyback program earlier this month and said it
purchased a record $3 billion of stock, consisting of 55.6
million shares, in the first quarter. The company has benefited
from growth in Mexico, Canada and China, as sales declined at
U.S. stores amid the worst recession since the 1930s. In March,
Wal-Mart boosted its annual dividend by 11 percent to $1.21.  
 Bonds issued by Wal-Mart have been the third-best
performers this month through yesterday among the 50-biggest
U.S. investment-grade borrowers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data show. The debt has surged 3.76 percent, trailing bonds
issued by Altria Group Inc., which rose 3.78 percent, and
American International Group Inc., which gained 4.8 percent.  
 Wal-Mart has $1.25 billion of 4.125 percent notes maturing
tomorrow, and $800 million of 4.75 percent debt due in August,
Bloomberg data show. It has $3.36 billion of bonds maturing next
year.  
 In April 2008, Wal-Mart sold $1 billion of five-year notes
and $2 billion of 30-year bonds, the data show.  
 Wal-Mart’s Rating  
 The new issue will represent the biggest debt sale by a
non-financial U.S. company since Discovery Communications sold
$3 billion of debt on May 26.  
 The average U.S. investment-grade bond pays a 209 basis
point spread as of yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate Master index.  
 Moody’s Investors Service assigns Wal-Mart a grade of Aa2,
two levels below the top investment-grade rating, and Standard &
Poor’s ranks it an equivalent AA.  
 Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc are managing today’s sale, the person said.
