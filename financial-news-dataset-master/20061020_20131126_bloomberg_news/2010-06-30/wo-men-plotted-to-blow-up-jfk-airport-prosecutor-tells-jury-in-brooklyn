             An ex-airline employee and a former
member of Guyana’s parliament plotted to blow up fuel lines and
tanks at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, a
prosecutor told jurors at the start of their terrorism trial.  
 “They took concrete steps to make this plan a reality,”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Winge Berger told the jury today
in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. “Fortunately, the
attack never happened. You see, the FBI was onto these men.”
