             South African stocks and the rand
headed for their first quarterly retreat in more than a year on
investors’ concern that slower economic growth from China to the
U.S. will damp demand for commodities.  
 The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  fell for a second day,
sliding 124.62, or 0.5 percent, to 26,574.08 as of 1 p.m. in
Johannesburg. The measure, in which commodity stocks account for
more than 40 percent of the weighting, has lost 7.5 percent in
the past three months, the first quarterly decline since March
2009. The rand has weakened 5.1 percent in the last three
months, last trading at 7.6286 per dollar.  
 Commodities are heading for their worst quarter in more
than a year, with the S&P GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw
materials plunging 2.9 percent yesterday as U.S. consumer
confidence sank more than forecast in June. The world’s largest
economy will slow in the next two quarters, according to as many
as 66 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The same is also likely
to occur in China, the biggest user of everything from coal to
copper, the surveys show.  
 “The U.S. is struggling to create jobs and China is
starting to run out of steam,”  Graeme Korner , a director at
Alpha Equity in Johannesburg, said by phone. “Debt levels in
the developed economies remain high and investors are starting
to question what the outlook for 2011 looks like.”  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
retreated 1.6 percent to 202.60 rand, bringing its decline in
the last three months to 20 percent.  Anglo American Plc  lost 1.3
percent to 273.48 rand, 14 percent drop since the end of March.
 Sasol Ltd. , the world’s biggest maker of motor fuel from coal,
slipped 0.9 percent to 277.50 rand, bringing its slump in the
last three months to 8.3 percent.  
 ‘Price Relapse’  
 “Fears about global growth and the sovereign-debt crisis
mean risk trades are being questioned, which implies weakness
for volatile currencies and commodity plays like the rand,”
 Imran Ahmad , an emerging-markets strategist in London at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in a telephone interview.
“Slower global growth suggests we could see a bit of a price
relapse for commodities. Nothing dramatic but the pressure for
now is downward rather than upward.”  
 RBS expects the rand to weaken to 8.30 to the dollar by
yearend, said Ahmad.
