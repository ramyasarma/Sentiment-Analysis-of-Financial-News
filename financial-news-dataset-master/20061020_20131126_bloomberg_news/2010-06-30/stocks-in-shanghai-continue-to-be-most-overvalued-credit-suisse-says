             Chinese stocks  traded in Shanghai
are still the most “overvalued” in Asia excluding Japan, even
after a drop in the market’s premium to the region, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index’s premium to the rest of Asia
has slipped to 34 percent from 84 percent on Dec. 31, based on a
model comparing price to book value against return on equity,
Credit Suisse analysts  Sakthi Siva  and Kin Nang Chik wrote in a
report today.  
 Siva, who is top ranked for Asian strategy in Institutional
Investor’s 2010 poll, said she prefers  South Korean , Thai, the
Philippine and Hong Kong-traded Chinese stocks.
