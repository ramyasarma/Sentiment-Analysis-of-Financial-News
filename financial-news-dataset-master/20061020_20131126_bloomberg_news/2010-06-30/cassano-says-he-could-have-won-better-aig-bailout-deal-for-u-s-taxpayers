             Joseph J. Cassano , whose derivative
bets on subprime loans forced American International Group Inc.
into a U.S. bailout, said he could have negotiated discounts on
collateral calls had he remained with the company.  
 Cassano could have won “a much better deal for the
taxpayer” by negotiating with banks demanding collateral from
AIG, Cassano said today in testimony to the  Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission . Cassano, 55, former head of AIG’s Financial
Products unit, left the company in March 2008. The insurer was
bailed out by the government in September of that year in a
rescue that used taxpayer funds to cover AIG’s obligations to
banks on derivative trades.
