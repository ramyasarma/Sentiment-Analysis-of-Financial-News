             Elon Musk , chief executive officer
of  Tesla Motors Inc. , made at least $24 million from the
electric-car maker’s initial public offering, restoring some of
the wealth he’s staked on the company and other startups.  
 Tesla set a price of $17 a share and Musk sold 1.42 million
shares, including an over-allotment to underwriters, according
to filings and data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla  rose  41 percent
yesterday, the second-biggest rally for a U.S. IPO this year.  
 Musk, 39, who made about $300 million selling PayPal Inc.
and Zip2 Corp., said in February he had just $650,000 in
“liquid assets” and got loans from friends to pay fees and
support for estranged wife  Justine Musk , according to a divorce-
related filing. The value of his remaining 26.9 million Tesla
shares was about $641 million, based on today’s close.  
 Tesla, the Palo Alto, California-based maker of the
$109,000 electric Roadster bought by  Brad Pitt  and  George Clooney , is using proceeds from the IPO to begin production of
the battery-powered Model S sedan and develop a range of
rechargeable models. Along with celebrity customers, Tesla
investors include Daimler AG.  Toyota Motor Corp.  said in May it
will buy a $50 million stake.  
 Tesla fell 6 cents to $23.83 at 4 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .  
 Energy Department Loan  
 The company also won $465 million of U.S. Energy Department
loans last year to expand production and sales of electric
vehicles and components. Terms of the federal loan agreement
require Musk and other top Tesla executives to retain at least
65 percent of the company’s shares. Musk has said in interviews
he’s invested at least $70 million of his own money in Tesla.  
 A divorce settlement won’t affect his stake, Musk said in a
Bloomberg Television interview yesterday.  
 “The Department of Energy, the underwriters, underwriters
council, other investors have done their due diligence,” Musk
said. “To the best of their assessment, they don’t think it
will have an effect.”  
 Musk is also CEO of closely held Space Exploration
Technologies Inc., or SpaceX, a Hawthorne, California-based
builder of rockets to carry satellites into space and supply the
International Space Station. He also leads  SolarCity Inc. , a
solar-panel installer.
