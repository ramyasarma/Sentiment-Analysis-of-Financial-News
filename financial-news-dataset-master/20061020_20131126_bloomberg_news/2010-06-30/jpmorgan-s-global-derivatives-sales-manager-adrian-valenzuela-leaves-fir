             JPMorgan Chase & Co. ’s global
derivatives sales manager,  Adrian Valenzuela , has left the
company.  
 Valenzuela’s departure last week comes three months after
his boss,  David Herzberg , left the firm.  Richard Berliand , who
ran JPMorgan’s global prime services business which oversaw
Valenzuela’s division, announced yesterday he would retire after
23 years at the company.  
 Valenzuela, who was based in London, joined JPMorgan in
2007 from Merrill Lynch & Co., where he was a managing director
and head of the Alpha Strategies group, the company said at the
time. Previously, he worked at London-based hedge fund WMG
Advisors.  
 Valenzuela’s departure was confirmed by his former
assistant, Leigh Baker, in London. JPMorgan spokesman  Brian Marchiony  wasn’t available for comment. Financial News earlier
reported Valenzuela leaving the New York-based company.
