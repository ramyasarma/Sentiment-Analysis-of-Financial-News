             Hindustan Copper Ltd., India’s
monopoly producer of the metal ore, fell in Mumbai trading on a
report the company has been valued at a discount to its current
market capitalization by at least three banks that have bid to
manage its share sale.  
 The government may raise half of the 60 billion
rupees ($1.3 billion) it estimated if the banks’ advice is
accepted, according to the Economic Times report today.  
 The shares fell as much as 4.1 percent to 460 rupees and
traded at 467.95 rupees as of 9:05 a.m.
