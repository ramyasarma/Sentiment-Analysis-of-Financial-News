             Peru’s sol is headed for its biggest
monthly gain since January on bets that growth in South
America’s sixth-largest economy will boost the local currency.  
 The sol advanced 0.7 percent against the dollar this month,
the steepest increase since January, when the currency gained
1.1 percent. It dropped 0.1 percent today to 2.8265 per dollar
at 11:56 a.m. New York time, from 2.8240 yesterday. The currency
has strengthened 0.6 percent during the quarter and 2.2 percent
in 2010.  
 Peru’s economy grew at the  fastest pace  in 19 months in
April, leading the central bank to revise its GDP forecast for
the year to 6.6 percent from 5.5 percent previously.  
 “Dollars are flowing into Peru thanks to the economic data
and expectations the sol will keep on strengthening,” said
 Ricardo Villamonte , head trader at Banco de Credito del Peru.
“More investment is coming into the region because of
confidence in the U.S. and Europe.”
