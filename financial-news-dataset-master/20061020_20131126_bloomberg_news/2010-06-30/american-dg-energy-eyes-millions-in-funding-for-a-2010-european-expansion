                  June 30 (Bloomberg New Energy Finance) --  American DG
Energy  Inc., a Massachusetts-based provider of heat and power
technologies, is looking to secure $3 million to $10 million
within months to establish a European subsidiary.  
 Chief Executive Officer  John Hatsopoulos  said the company
acts as an “on-site utility,” purchasing natural-gas powered
CHP units from the technology developer Tecogen, then installs,
operates and maintains them instead of selling the electricity
and hot water generated.  
 American DG, which joined the Russell 3000 index earlier
this month, said it hopes to establish a subsidiary in Europe by
year-end by raising initial funding from private investors,
institutional investors and funds.
