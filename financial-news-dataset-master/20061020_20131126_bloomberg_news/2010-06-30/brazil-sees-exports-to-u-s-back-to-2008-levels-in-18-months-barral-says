             Brazilian exports to the U.S., the
Latin American country’s second-biggest market after China, will
increase about 20 percent this year and return to 2008 levels
within 18 months, Trade Secretary  Welber Barral  said.  
 U.S. demand for Brazilian products is gradually recovering
as the U.S. economy rebounds, Barral said in an interview in
London today. Shipments to Europe will increase 3 percent to 4
percent this year and haven’t been badly hurt by the sovereign
debt crisis, he said.  
 Exports from Latin America’s largest economy to the U.S.
fell 43 percent to $15.6 billion in 2009 from 2008 as the
recession hurt demand for aircraft, iron ore and oil products,
according to the  Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign
Trade . The U.S., which buys about 10 percent of Brazil’s
exports, imported $7.26 billion of Brazilian goods from January
through May, a 22 percent rise from the same period last year.  
 “We need to recuperate in the U.S. market,” Barral said.
“The truth is that recovery will be slow, as the whole U.S.
economy is coming back slowly. We need another year to a year
and half to return to 2008 levels.”  
 China accounts for about 15 percent of Brazilian exports,
making it the nation’s biggest market.
