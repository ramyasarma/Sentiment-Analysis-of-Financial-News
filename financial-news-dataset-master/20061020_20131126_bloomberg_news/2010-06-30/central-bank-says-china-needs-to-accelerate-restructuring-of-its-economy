             China needs to accelerate its
economic restructuring and deepen financial reforms, the
People’s Bank of China said today.  
 The economy will maintain relatively steady growth this
year although it faces a “complicated situation” with
challenges at home and abroad, the central bank said in a report
on its website today.
