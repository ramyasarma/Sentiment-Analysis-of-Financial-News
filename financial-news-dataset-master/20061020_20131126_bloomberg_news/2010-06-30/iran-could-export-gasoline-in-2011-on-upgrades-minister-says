             Iran could begin exporting gasoline
as early as next year after upgrading its refineries, the oil
minister said today, even as the country now faces stiffened
U.S. sanctions that target fuel imports.  
 Iran aims to become self-sufficient in gasoline by adding
35 million liters (9.23 million gallons) of daily production
capacity through new units at existing refineries, the
ministry’s news agency,  Shana , cited  Masoud Mir-Kazemi  as
saying. The increase would enable Iran to produce excess fuel
for export, Shana quoted the minister as telling reporters after
a cabinet meeting. The country can already meet domestic needs
by refining fuel in petrochemical plants, Shana cited Mir-Kazemi
as saying.
