             Palladium, heading for the first
quarterly decline since the end of 2008, may fall toward $437.52
an ounce, the lowest in three weeks, according to technical
analysis by Commerzbank AG.  
 The attached chart shows the metal has fallen near its May
to June “support line” and the 50 percent retracement of its
advance since late May, one of the levels singled out in so-
called Fibonacci analysis. The second attached chart shows a
drop below these levels could push prices toward the late March
low of $440.25 and the 61.8 percent retracement of the rise
since May at $437.52.  
 “This is where we anticipate the market to stabilize,”
 Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at Commerzbank in London,
said in a report dated yesterday. “In case it doesn’t, the
technical outlook would turn bearish with the 200-day moving
average at $423.20” being targeted, he said.  
 Palladium for immediate delivery traded at $452.83 an ounce
at 10:30 a.m. in London today. The metal, used mainly in auto-
exhaust catalysts and jewelry, is down 5.7 percent this quarter.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.
