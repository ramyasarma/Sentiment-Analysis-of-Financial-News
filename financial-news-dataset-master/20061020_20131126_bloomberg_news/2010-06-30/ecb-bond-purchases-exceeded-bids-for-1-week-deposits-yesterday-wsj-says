             The European Central Bank took in 
less money from the banking system yesterday than it’s spent in
the first seven weeks of its bond-buying program, the Wall 
Street Journal reported.  
 The ECB received bids for only 31.8 billion euros of 
one-week deposits, against the 55 billion euros it needed to 
attract to match its purchases of Greek and other bonds, the 
newspaper said, adding that an ECB spokesman declined to 
comment.
