             The pound’s rally will be short-
lived as government-spending cuts curtail growth, forcing the
Bank of England to keep interest rates at a record low,
according to Commerzbank AG.  
 Sterling has risen because of a convincing emergency budget
and one member of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee
voting to raise rates at its last meeting, which stoked rate-
increase speculation, Commerzbank strategists led by Ulrich
Leuchtmann in Frankfurt wrote in a research note today.  
 “Speculation of this nature should however be premature,
in particular against the background of the government’s savings
programme,” they said. “If our view should be confirmed by BOE
comments, sterling is likely to receive a dampener. Until then
the appreciation trend is likely to continue.”  
 The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5047 as of 8:49 a.m. in
London, and weakened 0.4 percent to 81.20 pence per euro.
