             Clarkson Plc , the world’s largest
shipbroker, rose the most in two weeks after the company
reported continued steady improvement in its markets.  
 The shares jumped 35 pence, or 4.1 percent, to 895 pence at
9:58 a.m. in London. That’s the biggest increase since June 11
and values the company at 169.9 million pounds ($255.1 million).
The stock has advanced 21 percent this year.  
 “We have been pleased to see further positive signs across
a number of our markets,” London-based Clarkson said in a
statement distributed by Regulatory News Service. “These
trends, augmented by the movement in the value of sterling
against the U.S. dollar, mean that trading for the six months to
June 30, 2010, is ahead of the board’s expectations.”  
 Clarkson Securities Ltd., the company’s derivatives unit,
said on June 28 it handled the first cleared container shipping
trade. The contracts are used to hedge against or bet on future
hire rates for container ships. The Baltic Dry Index of costs to
ship commodities such as coal and iron ore collapsed a record 92
percent in 2008 before rebounding last year.  
 The  Baltic Dirty Tanker Index , a measure of costs on tanker
routes, fell 35 percent last year and 42 percent in 2008.
