             The Red Cross appealed for $3.3
million of emergency funding to help 385,000 people in  Niger , a
West African country that is experiencing food shortages.  
 The charity needs money to provide “vulnerable
households” with vouchers that will enable them to buy food in
regions where grain is available, the Geneva-based International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in an e-
mailed statement today.  
 More than 10 million people across West Africa are facing
severe hunger and malnutrition because of drought, poor harvests
and rising food prices, Oxfam International said earlier this
month. Almost half of the 7.1 million people in Niger, one of
the world’s poorest countries, are suffering food shortages, the
Red Cross said today.  
 “Most families are unable to even access the cereals that
are available because they are too expensive, and incomes have
been too low because of the bad harvest,” the charity said.
“The situation for children under five is worsening, so another
focus of our work is to provide community based screening and
referral of acute malnutrition cases.”
