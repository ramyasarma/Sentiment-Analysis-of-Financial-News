             Rafael Nadal, the 2008 Wimbledon
champion, beat Sweden’s Robin Soderling in four sets to reach
the semifinals at the All England Club today.  
 The Spaniard, who missed Wimbledon last year with a knee
injury, is the top-ranked player on the ATP Tour, but is seeded
No. 2 at Wimbledon. He won 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 against the
sixth-ranked Soderling.  
 Nadal claimed his seventh Grand Slam title earlier this
month at the French Open, beating Soderling in the final.
