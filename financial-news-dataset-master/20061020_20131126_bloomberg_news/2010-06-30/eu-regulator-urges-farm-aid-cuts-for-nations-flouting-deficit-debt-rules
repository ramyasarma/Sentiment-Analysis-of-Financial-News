             European Union regulators proposed
cutting farm subsidies for countries with excessive budget
deficits, seeking to widen the range of penalties for
spendthrift governments that endanger the euro’s stability.  
 The European Commission said countries that fail to bring
deficits back below the limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product could be denied EU agricultural aid, forcing them to
support farmers from their own budgets.  
 A wider array of sanctions would “strengthen the
credibility of the EU’s fiscal framework,” the Brussels-based
commission said in a statement today. “These should also be
used preventively and would kick in at an earlier stage.”  
 EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn 
said the idea is to use the 27-nation bloc’s budget “as
additional leverage” to compel governments to comply with
fiscal rules.  
 Agriculture is the biggest single subsidy provided by the
EU, accounting for 55 billion euros ($67.6 billion) out of a
total budget of 117 billion euros in 2008.  
 The commission also proposed financial sanctions on euro-
area countries that make “insufficient progress” toward
budget-cutting targets. It also sought reductions in EU
infrastructure subsidies for deficit violators.  
 Rehn told reporters in Brussels he aims to make legislative
proposals for the new sanctions by the end of September.
