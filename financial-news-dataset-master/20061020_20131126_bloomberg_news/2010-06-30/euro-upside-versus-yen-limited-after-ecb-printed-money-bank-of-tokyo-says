             The potential upside for the euro
against the yen is limited after the European Central Bank
effectively conducted quantitative easing, according to Bank of
Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ.  
 The euro will fall close to 100 yen as Japanese investors
favor U.S. assets over euro-region ones,  Derek Halpenny ,
European head of global currency research in London, wrote in a
report today.  
 The ECB drained 31.8 billion euros ($39.1 billion) in one-
week funds yesterday, short of the 55 billion euros it aimed to
remove from the financial system after spending that amount on
European government bonds since May 10.  
 “The ECB have been strenuous in informing the markets that
every cent of purchases would be drained but already, and after
a relatively small sum of purchases, the ECB has effectively
conducted quantitative easing,” Halpenny said. “The upside
potential for euro-yen is limited in these circumstances.”  
 The euro rose 0.9 percent to 108.92 yen as of 10:57 a.m. in
London.
