             CMA CGM SA said that no decision has
been taken on a possible new investor and that talks are
continuing.  
 Activity recovered very strongly in the first half, the
French shipping company said in an emailed statement.  
 Wansquare reported earlier today that CMA CGM’s controlling
Saade family has decided on the Qatari Holdings investment fund
as its preferred new co-owner.
