             Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA,
Italy’s state-owned lender, may swap part of its holding in  Enel
SpA  for a stake in  Eni SpA , daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The lender may reduce its 17 percent stake in Enel, Italy’s
largest utility, to 5 percent in exchange for a 7 percent stake
in energy company Eni, according to the newspaper.  
 Cassa Depositi at a board meeting today may also consider
buying the Trans Austria gas pipeline, Il Sole said. Eni owns 89
percent of TAG. That deal would be linked to a swap between the
two energy companies, Sole reported.  
 Cassa Depositi may also consider returning stakes in other
companies, including the Italian Post Office, to the Treasury,
Sole said.
