             Brazil’s real rose the most in a
week as policy makers signaled Latin America’s biggest economy
may expand at the fastest pace in more than two decades in 2010.  
 The real climbed 1 percent to 1.7963 per dollar at 8:53
a.m. New York time, from 1.8134 yesterday. The gain extended the
currency’s increase in June to 1.4 percent, paring its quarterly
decline to 1 percent. The real is down 2.9 percent this year.  
 Brazil’s gross domestic product may grow 7.3 percent this
year, up from a 5.8 percent forecast in the central bank’s March
report. Consumer prices will rise 5.4 percent this year, up from
a 5.2 percent forecast in the March report, according to the
bank’s base-case scenario. Inflation will slow to 5 percent in
2011, compared with a 4.9 percent forecast in March.  
 “The Brazilian inflation report endorsed a bullish growth
outlook, reinforcing the view that demand in Brazil remains very
strong, primarily on the back of credit,” said  Flavia Cattan- Naslausky , a currency strategist with RBS Securities Inc. in
Stamford, Connecticut. “That keeps a high-rates scenario in
Brazil. That’s where Brazil is differentiating itself in spite
of external factors, and that’s a positive for the real.”  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
 contracts  due in January fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.33 percent.
