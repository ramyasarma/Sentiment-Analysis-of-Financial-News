             Nissan Motor Co.  Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said it’s inevitable that wages in the
automotive industry in developing markets will rise, following
labor unrest in China over low pay.  
 “I’ve never seen an emerging country where wages don’t go
up,” Ghosn said during a question and answer session after a
speech at a university in Bangkok. Carmakers in countries
including Brazil, China, India and Thailand will have to raise
salaries, he said.  
 Striking workers in China, the world’s largest automobile
market, has forced parts makers to boost wages, increasing
production costs for Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor
Co. At least eight strikes have taken place in the past month in
the country, where a shrinking supply of low-cost labor is
increasing workers’ bargaining power.  
 Car and parts companies need to implement salary increases
“in a way that is smooth, in a way that is anticipated and
realistic,” Ghosn said.  
 Nissan is asking its management in China to be “more
present, more communicative” as a result of the strikes, he
said. The labor unrest won’t lead Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan
to reorganize its operations there, the executive said.  
 “People want a better life,” Ghosn said. “Our role is
not to deny that.”
