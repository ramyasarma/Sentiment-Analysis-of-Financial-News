             The Swiss franc snapped a four-day
gain against the euro before a report forecast to show the
economy is recovering from recession, as rising stock markets
sapped demand for the currency as a refuge.  
 The franc weakened from near its strongest level against
the European currency since the euro’s 1999 debut. Switzerland’s
leading economic indicators likely stayed at the highest in more
than two years in June, economists said before the report is
released today. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  added 0.2 percent,
recovering some of a 3 percent plunge yesterday.  
 “The franc has declined as the euro got a boost from an
improved risk environment,” said  Ian Stannard , a senior
foreign-exchange strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London. “The
Swiss franc is likely to remain very well supported going
forward.”  
 The franc weakened 0.2 percent to 1.3213 per euro as of
9:46 a.m. in London and was little changed at 1.0819 per dollar,
near the lowest level since May 3. The franc appreciated to
1.3166 yesterday, its strongest-ever level against the euro.
