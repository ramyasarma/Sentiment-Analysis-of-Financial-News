             Rice fell to the lowest price in
more than three years after a U.S. government report showed an
increase in farmland planted with long-grain varieties.  
 U.S. growers seeded 2.765 million acres with the grain, up
21 percent from a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture
said in a  report today . In  March , the USDA forecast 2.575
million acres would be seeded. Rice has plunged 35 percent this
year on rising production and declining demand.  
 “That acreage number is much bigger than we thought it was
going to be,” said  Dennis DeLaughter , the owner of Progressive
Farm Marketing Inc. in Edna, Texas. “This is a huge acreage.
We’re going to be sticking rice in garages in the Rice Belt.”  
 Rice futures for September delivery fell 30.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $9.685 per 100 pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price earlier touched $9.55, the lowest since Oct. 31, 2006.
Futures fell 21 percent in the second quarter.  
 The acreage increased because the price had risen late last
year when farmers were making planting decisions, topping out at
$16.27 on Dec. 14, a 13-month high, DeLaughter said.  
 “The acreage number is accurate because when growers were
making their decisions, we had prices from $13 to $15, and they
thought the market was crying for more rice,” DeLaughter said.
“I was saying that we were planting too much rice, that if we
planted more rice we’d have a real dilemma.”  
 The most-active futures contract may fall as low as $8.80
before rebounding, said DeLaughter, who grows rice, wheat and
corn in southeastern Texas.  
 “That would bode well for sales,” he said. “We could see
some countries step in and buy at that level. We are looking at
a very, very long year for rice growers.”
