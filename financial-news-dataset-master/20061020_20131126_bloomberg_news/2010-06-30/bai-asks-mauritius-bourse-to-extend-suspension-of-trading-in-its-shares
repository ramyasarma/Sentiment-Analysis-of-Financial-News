             British American Investment Co. Ltd.
asked the Stock Exchange of Mauritius to extend the suspension
of trading in its shares until July 9 from June 30, the bourse
said.  
 Trading in the company’s stock will resume on July 12,
according to a statement from the Port Louis-based stock
exchange, distributed by Cim Stockbrokers in an e-mail today.
The company asked for the extension after the late receipt of
offer documents by some of BAI shareholders from Seaton
Investment Ltd., the exchange said.
