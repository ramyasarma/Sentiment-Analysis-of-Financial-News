             Asian  stocks  fell, dragging the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to its biggest quarterly decline in more than
a year, as a slump in U.S. consumer confidence fueled concerns
about the strength of the global economy.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
declined 1.2 percent after the drop in the U.S. Conference
Board’s confidence index contributed to the biggest slump in
commodity prices in 10 months. Honda Motor Co. and  Canon Inc. ,
which get more than a quarter of their revenue in the Americas,
slid 1.9 percent in Tokyo as a stronger yen dented their profit
outlooks.  Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.  led chip-related shares lower
after Mizuho Securities Co. cut its investment rating.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  fell 0.9 percent to 112.90 as
of 7:32 p.m. in Tokyo, the lowest level since June 11. The gauge
has slumped 9.8 percent this quarter, the most since the three
months to Dec. 31, 2008, on concern Europe’s debt crisis and
Chinese steps to curb property prices will hurt global growth.
U.S. President Barack Obama said yesterday the U.S. economy
faces “headwinds” from the European debt crisis.  
 “The view is spreading among investors that a recovery in
the global economy won’t be as easy as people had expected,”
said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $65 billion. “Moves
by countries around the world to tighten fiscal policies are
behind the plunge in markets.”  
 Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  lost 2 percent, the
biggest decline among Asia-Pacific benchmark gauges. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index
and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 0.6 percent.  
 U.S. Confidence  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  increased 0.7
percent. The gauge slumped 3.1 percent yesterday to its lowest
level since Oct. 30 after the Conference Board’s gauge of
confidence among consumers slumped to 52.9 this month from a
revised 62.7 in May as Americans became pessimistic about the
outlook for the labor market and the economy.  
 The  MSCI World Index  was little changed. The gauge slid 3.2
percent yesterday after the Conference Board revised its April
leading economic index for China to a 0.3 percent increase from
a gain of 1.7 percent reported June 15.  
 China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  lost 1.2 percent today
amid speculation economists may reduce their forecasts. A third
of China economists may reduce their “overly bullish” growth
estimates for 2010 and 2011 in coming weeks because of property
tightening measures,  Ting Lu , a Hong Kong-based economist at
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients.  
 Negative Sentiment  
 “It’s not a bad thing that the Chinese government is
trying to cool down the economy, but it’s had a negative impact
on market sentiment,” said  Khiem Do , Hong Kong-based head of
multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd.
which oversees about $10 billion.  
 Speculation global growth will slow has helped drag down
the average price of stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index to
about 14.2 times estimated profit, compared with 24 times a year
ago. The gauge lost 0.5 percent last week after new-home sales
in the U.S. tumbled to a record low.  
 BHP, Australia’s biggest oil producer, sank 1.2 percent to
A$37.65. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s No. 3 mining company, lost
2.6 percent to A$66.66.  Mitsubishi Corp. , which trades
commodities, fell 2 percent to 1,864 yen in Tokyo.  Korea Zinc Co. 
the world’s second-biggest smelter of the metal, lost 3.5
percent to 218,000 won.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials tumbled
2.8 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 14. Copper futures in
New York lost 5.2 percent, while oil declined 3 percent.  
 ‘Skittishness, Nervousness’  
 “We have seen some very positive trends in a number of
sectors,” U.S. President Obama said at the White House after a
meeting with his economic advisers yesterday. “Unfortunately,
because of the troubles we’ve seen in Europe, we’re now seeing
some headwinds and skittishness and nervousness on the part of
the markets.”  
 PetroChina Co. , the country’s biggest oil producer, fell as
much as 2.4 percent before closing up 0.3 percent at HK$8.77.
Declines were limited after the company and JX Holdings Inc.,
Japan’s biggest refiner, signed a preliminary agreement to form
a venture to produce fuel at a plant in western Japan.  
 Japanese exporters declined as the stronger yen threatened
to reduce the value of overseas income when repatriated. The yen
appreciated against the euro to as much as 107.69 today from
108.82 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. Japan’s
currency rose to as much as 88.39 per dollar from 88.76.  
 Foxconn Loss  
 Honda sank 1.9 percent to 2,597 yen. Canon declined 1.9
percent to 3,330 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. , which gets about a third
of its sales in North America, fell 0.5 percent to 626 yen.  
 Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the world’s largest
electronics contract manufacturer, tumbled 5.8 percent to NT$114
in Taipei after its Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. unit
forecast a wider first-half net loss.  Foxconn  plunged 6.9
percent to HK$5.11 in Hong Kong.  
 Shin-Etsu, which makes silicon wafers for semiconductors,
lost 4 percent to 4,175 yen after Mizuho cut its investment
rating to “neutral” from “outperform.”  
 Sumco Corp. , a competitor, sank 1.9 percent to 1,489 yen.
Tokyo Electron Co., the world’s second-biggest maker of
semiconductor equipment, declined 3.1 percent to 4,855 yen.  
 Chip stocks in Asia also fell after Micron Technology Inc.,
the largest U.S. maker of computer memory, slumped the most in
19 months yesterday on speculation it has too many unsold chips
and that output of other products isn’t increasing fast enough.  
 In Seoul,  Samsung Electronics Co. , Asia’s biggest chipmaker,
slumped 2.3 percent to 774,000 won, while  Hynix Semiconductor
Inc. , the world’s second-largest computer-memory chipmaker,
declined 2.2 percent to 25,050 won.  
 Dena, Shionogi  
 Dena Co., which operates auction and shopping websites,
tumbled 8.9 percent to 2,344 yen, the biggest decline in the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The stock was downgraded to “hold”
from “buy” at Deutsche Bank AG.  
 Also in Tokyo,  Shionogi & Co. , which makes the Crestor
cholesterol pill, rose 7.2 percent to 1,843 yen after winning a
U.S. court ruling that will help prevent sales of cheaper copies
of the drug. In Seoul,  Woongjin Energy Co. , a solar components
maker, surged 45 percent to 13,800 won its first day of trading.
