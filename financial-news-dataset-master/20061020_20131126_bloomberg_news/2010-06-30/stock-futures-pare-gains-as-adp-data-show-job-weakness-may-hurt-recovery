             Global stocks, U.S. index futures
and commodities pared gains, while Treasuries trimmed their
decline, as an industry jobs report spurred concern the
employment market is struggling to recover.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September rose 0.2 to 1,037 at 8:34 a.m. in New York after
rallying 0.9 percent earlier.  The MSCI World Index  of 24
developed nations was little changed, wiping out a 0.3 percent
advance. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose
less than one basis point to 2.96 percent after climbing as much
as four basis points earlier. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities
increased less than 0.1 percent after rallying 0.9 percent.  
 The pullback in riskier assets came as ADP Employer
Services said companies in the U.S. expanded payrolls by 13,000
in June, lower than the 60,000 median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Earlier gains in stocks, U.S. futures and
commodities came after European lenders sought less central-bank
funding than investors had estimated, easing concern the
region’s debt crisis is worsening.  
 “Lame is the first word that comes to mind,” Peter
Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York,
said in a note to clients about the ADP jobs data. “Bottom line,
relative to the monthly increase in the labor force that is
needed to be absorbed by job growth, we are in the midst of a 3rd
straight jobless recovery.  
 The S&P 500 plunged 3.1 percent yesterday to its lowest
level since Oct. 30, on concern over weakening growth in China
and a slump in American consumer confidence. The decline pushed
the gauge to its cheapest valuation relative to expected company
earnings since March 2009, when an 80 percent rally followed.  
 The S&P 500 is valued at 12.8 times projected profits,
according to Bloomberg data, after falling 11 percent this
quarter. The index has tumbled 14 percent from this year’s high
on April 23 on concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
China’s moves to slow the world’s largest emerging economy will
dent global growth.
