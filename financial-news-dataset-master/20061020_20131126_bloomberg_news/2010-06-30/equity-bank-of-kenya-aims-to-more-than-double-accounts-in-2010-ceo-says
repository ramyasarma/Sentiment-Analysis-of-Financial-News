             Equity Bank Ltd. , Kenya’s largest
provider of small loans, plans to more than double the number of
accountholders this year after forming a partnership with
 Safaricom Ltd. , East Africa’s biggest mobile-network operator.  
 “This is providing an opportunity to open at least 5
million new accounts by the end of the year,” Chief Executive
Officer  James Mwangi  said in an interview in Moscow today.  
 Safaricom and Equity Bank announced on May 18 an initiative
where Kenyans will be able to open bank accounts through
Safaricom’s mobile money-transfer service known as MPESA.  
 Branded Mkesho, the new service will allow Equity Bank,
which has 4.5 million customers, to transform Safaricom’s more
than 18,000 MPESA sales agents into mobile-banking agents. MPESA
has almost 10 million customers, Pauline Vaughn, who runs the
service, said June 23.  
 Equity Bank also plans to start a mortgage-lending unit and
will allocate $200 million to the project, Mwangi said.  
 The bank owns 25 percent of  Housing Finance Co. , Kenya’s
only publicly traded mortgage company. Housing Finance has
doubled lending to 16 billion shillings ($195.8 million) since
it began its partnership with Equity in July 2007. Equity Bank
will continue issuing mortgages through Housing Finance even
after it begins providing such loans directly, Mwangi said.  
 “We now would be able to do both,” Mwangi said.
