             Celgene Corp. , the maker of blood
cancer drugs, agreed to buy  Abraxis BioScience Inc.  for $2.9
billion in cash and stock to acquire a solid-tumor medicine.  
 The acquisition values Los Angeles-based Abraxis at $71.93
a share, 17 percent more than yesterday’s closing price on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. That calculation excludes the value of
tradable rights that Abraxis shareholders will receive.  
 Celgene, which markets the best-selling pill Revlimid, will
gain the drug Abraxane, approved by U.S. regulators for treating
metastatic breast cancer. The medicine brought in $315 million
in sales last year, 88 percent of Abraxis’s revenue, and is in
testing for lung and pancreatic tumors. Celgene has been making
acquisitions to expand in oncology, and Abraxane enables it to
broaden from hematology treatments into solid tumors.  
 “Abraxane appears to be a good strategic fit for Celgene’s
oncology franchise and appears poised for growth via label
expansions, and broader geographic promotion,” said  Eric Schmidt , an analyst at Cowen & Co. LLC in New York, in a note to
investors today. “On the negative side, Celgene is paying a
substantial premium,” he said.  
 The acquisition probably will close in the fourth quarter,
the companies said. The purchase will reduce earnings at Summit,
New Jersey-based Celgene next year, and will increase profit in
2012, the companies said in a statement.  
 Significant Value  
 “Executing this plan will create significant value and
afford us the potential to grow Abraxane to $1 billion in
revenue in 2015,” said  Robert Hugin , Celgene’s president and
chief executive officer, on a conference call today.  
 Each Abraxis share will be converted into $58 a share in
cash and 0.2617 of a Celgene share, according to the statement.
The stock portion of the deal is valued at $13.93 a share based
on yesterday’s closing price for Celgene.  
 Abraxis holders also will receive one contingent value
right per share that entitles them to payments if the company’s
Abraxane drug is approved by U.S. regulators for lung and
pancreatic cancer, and royalties if the treatment and other
products meet sales goals. Abraxis has five compounds in various
stages of development, all focused in solid tumors.  
 Morgan Stanley & Co. was the financial adviser to Celgene
on the transaction. Lazard Freres & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
and BofA Merrill Lynch acted as co-financial advisers to
Abraxis.  
 Shares React  
 Celgene fell $2.42, or 4.6 percent, to $50.82 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Abraxis rose $12.89, or
21 percent, to $74.20.  
 Abraxane’s “nab” technology combines the proven
chemotherapy paclitaxel with the protein albumin, enabling the
drug to be given at a higher dose and breach blood vessel walls
more effectively, according to the company. Celgene may explore
the application of this technology to other compounds, including
its experimental lung-cancer therapy amrubicin, said  Geoffrey Porges , an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co. in New York, in
a note to investors today.  
 At a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology
earlier this month, Abraxis presented data from a study that
found Abraxane benefitted more than one-third of pancreatic-
cancer patients who didn’t respond to a standard treatment. The
company also presented the results of a late-stage trial that
showed Abraxane worked better than paclitaxel as a first-line
treatment for lung cancer.  
 Celgene’s two top-selling drugs are Revlimid and Thalomid,
which are treatments for multiple myeloma. They brought in more
than 80 percent of the company’s $2.69 billion in 2009 revenue.
In January, Celgene acquired closely held Gloucester
Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $340 million, gaining the marketed
lymphoma drug Istodax.
