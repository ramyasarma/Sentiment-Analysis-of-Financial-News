             (Corrects value of Eni stake in fourth paragraph to 12.4
billion euros.)  
 Italy’s Finance Ministry will swap
part of its 20.3 percent stake in oil company Eni SpA, for 17.4
percent of Enel SpA, Italy’s biggest electricity company, and
shares of STMicroelectronics SpA and Poste Italiane SpA with
state-controlled lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA.  
 The agreement stems from a ruling by the country’s
competition regulator, CDP said in a statement on the Italian
exchange.  
 In addition to the Enel stake, the Finance Ministry will
receive CDP’s 35 percent holding in Poste Italiane, the
country’s postal service, and a 13.8 percent stake in
STMicroelectronics.  
 The amount swapped of the ministry’s Eni stake, currently
worth about 12.4 billion euros, will be determined based upon
the value of the stakes it receives, CDP said. The Enel stake
owned by CDP is worth about 5.7 billion euros.
