             German Deputy Finance Minister
 Steffen Kampeter  said he’s confident that European Union
governments will act should the planned publication of stress
tests on banks reveal weaknesses.  
 “Our expectation for the stress tests is that it will
communicate confidence to the markets our banking sector is
stable,” Kampeter said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television.  
 The tests “are a good chance to show how strong the
European banking system is at the moment,” he said yesterday by
phone from Berlin. “If there are weaknesses, we’re confident
that national governments, within their schemes, will solve any
necessities for political or economic action.”  
 The EU has pledged about $915 billion to reassure markets
and backstop the euro, which has fallen 14 percent against the
dollar this year on concerns that Greece’s debt crisis is
spreading. The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-
year bonds over benchmark German bunds has jumped to about 800
basis points, almost five times the level a year ago.  
 Kampeter said he doesn’t “see a necessity” to restructure
Greek debt, saying the country’s budget consolidation program is
“working quite well.”  
 Kampeter said he’s less concerned about the euro’s exchange
rate than the currency’s stability over time. The euro “is very
stable and will survive any sources of instability,” he said.  
 The deputy minister rejected criticism that Germany’s
planned deficit reduction from next year may  damp growth  in
Europe. The cuts are “moderate but necessary, and that shows
that fiscal consolidation and a certain impulse for growth are
not contradictory.”  
 Germany’s labor union-affiliated IMK economic institute
yesterday raised its 2011 economic growth forecast to 1.5
percent from 1.2 percent and said Germany’s budget deficit will
decline from 4.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 to
3.8 percent of GDP in 2011.
