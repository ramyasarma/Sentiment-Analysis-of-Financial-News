             Cattle futures climbed to almost a
four-week high on speculation that U.S. beef supplies will
shrink as rising corn prices spur farmers to feed livestock less
or trim herds. Hogs also gained.  
 Corn, the main ingredient in cattle feed, jumped the most
in nine months today on the Chicago Board of Trade after a
government report showed farmers sowed fewer acres than
expected. U.S. beef production this year may be the  smallest 
since 2005, after farmers cut herds in 2008 and 2009, as high
feed costs and the recession led to losses.  
 Gains in cattle futures have “got more to do with the
grains than anything,” said  Troy Vetterkind , the owner of
Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in Chicago. “It’s one of those days
where the momentum is to the topside.”  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 1.275 cents, or 1.4
percent, to 90.025 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier the price touched 90.5 cents, the highest
since June 3. The most-active contract still dropped 3.8 percent
during the quarter, the first decline in five quarters.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.175
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.1305 a pound.  
 Corn Prices Surge  
 Corn climbed as much as 30 cents, the most allowed by the
CBOT, to $3.74 a bushel today. Farmers sowed 87.872 million
acres (35.6 million hectares), which was below a prior
government forecast, as wet, cold weather last month reduced
plantings, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report.  
 Wholesale- choice beef  rose to a three-week high at midday
at $1.5555 a pound, according to the USDA. Beef prices were
supported by “some last-minute buying” by retailers ahead of
the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, Vetterkind said.  
 Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.7 cent, or 0.9
percent, to 81.65 cents a pound on the CME. Futures declined 1.5
percent this quarter, the first drop in three quarters.
