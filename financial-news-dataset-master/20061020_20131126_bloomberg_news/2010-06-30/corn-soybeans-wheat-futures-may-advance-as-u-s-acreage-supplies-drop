             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after a government report
said that U.S. growers seeded less of the grain than
anticipated, said  Mike Zuzolo , the president of Global Commodity
Analytics in Lafayette, Indiana.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
after a U.S. report showed supplies on June 1 fell 4.2 percent
from a year earlier. Soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2
higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open 0.2
cent to 0.3 cent a pound higher.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on speculation that demand for the grain to use
as animal feed will increase after the area seeded with corn
declines.
