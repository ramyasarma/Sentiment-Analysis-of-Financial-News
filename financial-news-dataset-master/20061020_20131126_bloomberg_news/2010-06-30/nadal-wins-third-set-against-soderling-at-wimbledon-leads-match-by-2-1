             Rafael Nadal, the 2008 Wimbledon
champion, won the third set of his quarterfinal at the All
England Club against Sweden’s Robin Soderling in a tiebreak to
lead 2-1.  
 The Spaniard, who missed Wimbledon last year with a knee
injury, is the top-ranked player on the ATP Tour, but is seeded
No. 2 at Wimbledon. He leads the sixth-ranked Soderling 3-6, 6-
3, 7-6 (7-4).  
 Nadal claimed his seventh Grand Slam title earlier this
month at the French Open, beating Soderling in the final.
