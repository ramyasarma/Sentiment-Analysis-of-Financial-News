             Woongjin Energy Co. , a solar
components maker, rose on its trading debut in Seoul on demand
from investors who missed buying the stock in its initial public
offering.  
 The shares advanced 45 percent to 13,800 won as of 10:54
a.m. on the Korea Exchange from the offer price of 9,500 won.
The benchmark Kospi index retreated 1.3 percent.  
 Woongjin raised 150 billion won ($124 million) last week by
selling 15.88 million new shares above its offer range of
between 7,500 won and 8,500 won. Individuals applied for 162
times the number of shares allocated to them, according to lead
arranger Daishin Securities Co.  
 Woongjin’s operating  profit  may grow 26 percent annually by
2012, helped by increasing output and strong demand,  Han Byung Hwa , an analyst at Hyundai Securities Co. said in a report today.
Han rated Woongjin a ‘buy’ with a six-month target price of
17,000 won.  
 Woongjin plans to spend 270 billion won between November
last year and September to boost its silicon ingot production
capacity to meet rising demand, the joint venture of  Woongjin
Holdings Co.  and  SunPower Corp. , the second-biggest U.S.
manufacturer of solar-power modules, said on June 1.  
 The global market for solar energy may grow 60 percent a
year by 2012, according to the company. Woongjin Energy’s sales
reached 118.9 billion won last year.
