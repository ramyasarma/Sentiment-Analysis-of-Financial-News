             Tea production in Kenya, the world’s
biggest exporter of black tea, slowed in recent weeks because of
rising temperatures in the country’s main growing areas, the Tea
Board of Kenya said.  
 “The slowdown is expected to last for about three months,”
Sicily Kariuki, the board’s managing director, told reporters
today in the capital, Nairobi.  
 Output will drop after rising 15 percent in the first half,
Kariuki said, without providing detailed production figures. The
East African country produced 139.3 million kilograms (307.1
million pounds) of the leaf in same period a year earlier,
according to the board’s  website .  
 Heavy downpours in Kenya during the March-to-May rainy
season ended an almost two-year drought, which had cut
agricultural production. In the first quarter, tea production
surged 69 percent to 111.7 million kilograms, the board said in
April.  
 Egypt is the biggest buyer of Kenya’s tea, followed by the
U.K. and Afghanistan. The country plans to seek new markets in
North America, Titus Kipyab, the tea board’s chairman, told
reporters in Nairobi today.  
 “Over-concentration in five traditional markets continues
to pose a risk, with over 75 percent of all tea exports being
sold to Egypt, Pakistan, the U.K., Sudan and Afghanistan,”
Kipyab said.  
 Kenya also plans to boost tea-growers’ earnings by branding
the commodity, Kipyab said, without providing further details.
As much as 94 percent of the tea produced in the country is
exported in bulk, he said.
