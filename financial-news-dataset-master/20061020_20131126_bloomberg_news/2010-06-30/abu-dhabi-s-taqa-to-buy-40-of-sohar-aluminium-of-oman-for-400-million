             Abu Dhabi National Energy Co., known
as TAQA, agreed to buy a 40 percent stake in Sohar Aluminium Co.
of Oman from Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority for $400
million.  
 “Our track record in power generation means that we are
well placed to add value to such an energy-intensive business as
aluminum,” TAQA’s Chief Executive Officer  Abdulla Saif al- Nuaimi  said in a statement today. “This is a high-quality
operation and is not only expected to increase TAQA’s cash flow,
but provides entry for us into the Sultanate of Oman.”  
 Abu Dhabi Water owns 51.05 percent of TAQA, which has oil
and gas production assets and utilities in the Middle East,
North America, the North Sea and India. Its TAQA North unit
bought a portion of Suncor Energy Inc.’s assets in west central
Alberta in Canada for C$285 million, it said on June 23.  
 Sohar Aluminium ’s other shareholders are Oman Oil Co.,
which holds 40 percent, and  Rio Tinto Group , with 20 percent,
according to Sohar’s company’s website.
