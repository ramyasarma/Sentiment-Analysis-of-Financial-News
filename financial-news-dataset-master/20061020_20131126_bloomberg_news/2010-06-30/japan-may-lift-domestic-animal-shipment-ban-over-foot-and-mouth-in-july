             Japan may lift a ban in July on
domestic beef and pork shipments imposed two months ago after an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth, as no cases have been found since
the government completed culling infected animals last week.  
 Shipments of live animals from disease-hit areas in
Miyazaki prefecture in southern Japan may resume as early as
July 16, unless a fresh outbreak occurs, said Hiroaki Ogura at
the animal health division of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries. The government finished slaughtering all
infected animals on June 25.  
 The resumption could boost meat supply in Japan,
potentially curbing demand for imported pork and beef, as
Miyazaki is the nation’s second-biggest pig producer and third-
largest for beef cattle. Foot-and-mouth is one of the most
contagious livestock diseases and can have high mortality rates
in young animals, according to the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health, or  OIE .  
 “The risk of the disease’s spread is declining,” Ogura
said today in a telephone interview. “We plan to finish culling
of the vaccinated animals today or tomorrow.”  
 Japan is set to complete the slaughter of 276,049 animals,
of which 199,293 were infected and the rest were vaccinated for
protection from the disease. Of the total, 208,076 were pigs,
67,956 were beef cattle and dairy cows, and the rest were sheep
and goats.  
 First Outbreak  
 The figures represent 2.1 percent of Japan’s total swine
herd and 1.5 percent of overall cattle and cows. The country’s
first outbreak of the disease since 2000 was reported on April
20 from a cattle farm in Tsuno town in eastern Miyazaki.  
 Japan imposed a ban on the movements of animals that live
within a radius of 10 kilometers from the affected farms. The
government also prohibited shipments of animals living in a
radius of 10 to 20 kilometers of the disease-hit farms for trade
outside the area.  
 Japan slaughtered 1.47 million hogs in April to produce
114,300 metric tons of pork, the latest  data  from the
agriculture ministry showed. The number dropped 1.8 percent from
March, while the volume decreased 1.7 percent.  
 The wholesale price of pork averaged 428 yen ($4.8) per
kilogram in Japan’s meat markets in April, rising 1.9 percent
from March, the ministry data showed.  
 Limited Impact  
 “Foot-and-mouth disease has had limited impact on the
balance of supply and demand in Japan’s meat markets, as the
affected animals represent a small share of the nation’s total
herd,” Yuichi Imasaki at the ministry’s meat and egg division
said today by phone.  
 The number of cattle and cows Japan slaughtered in April
rose 5.3 percent from March to 105,553, according to the
ministry data. Beef production increased by 6.4 percent to
45,314 tons. The wholesale price for beef rose 6.5 percent to
1,067 yen a kilogram on average in April.  
 Japan  imported  475,000 tons of beef in the year ended March
31, climbing 1.2 percent from a year earlier, according to the
ministry. Australia was the biggest supplier with 355,488 tons,
while the U.S. was the second-largest with 73,823 tons.  
 Japan imported 692,000 tons of pork last fiscal year,
declining 15 percent from a year earlier. The U.S. represented
40 percent of the total supply, while Canada was the second-
largest exporter with 25 percent.
