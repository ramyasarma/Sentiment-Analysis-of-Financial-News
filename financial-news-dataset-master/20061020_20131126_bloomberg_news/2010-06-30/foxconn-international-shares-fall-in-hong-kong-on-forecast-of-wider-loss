              Foxconn International Holdings Ltd.
fell in Hong Kong premarket trading after it predicted
its first-half loss will widen in part because of lower prices
for its products.  
 The shares declined 4.9 percent to HK$5.22 on the city’s
stock exchange. The company also cited “changes in product mix
and higher depreciation expenses” as reasons for the higher
deficit, according to a Foxconn statement. The supplier to Nokia
Oyj and Motorola Inc. posted a loss of $19 million in last
year’s first half.
