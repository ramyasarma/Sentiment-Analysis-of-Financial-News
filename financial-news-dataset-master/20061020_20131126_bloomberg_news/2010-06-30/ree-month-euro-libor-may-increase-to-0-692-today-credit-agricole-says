             The rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros may rise today, according to Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  
 The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for such loans
may climb to 0.692 percent, said Orlando Green, a fixed-income

 Libor for three-month dollars may stay at 0.533 percent,
Green said.  
 The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for three-
month loans may increase to 0.764 percent, he said. The rate was
