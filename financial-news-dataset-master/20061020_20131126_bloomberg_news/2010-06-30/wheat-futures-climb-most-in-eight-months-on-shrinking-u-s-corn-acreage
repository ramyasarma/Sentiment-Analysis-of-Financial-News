             Wheat rose the most in eight months
after a government report showed shrinking U.S. corn acreage,
signaling lower grain supplies for livestock feed.  
 U.S. farmers sowed 87.872 million acres (35.6 million
hectares) with corn, fewer than expected and below a prior
government forecast as below-average temperatures and wet
weather in May interfered with field work. Spring-wheat acres
may total 13.907 million, up 4.8 percent from last year and
above analysts’ estimates.  
 “The wheat numbers look bearish, but that’s going to be
tempered by the corn numbers,” said  Jason Britt , the president
of Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri.
“Corn is going to be the trump card. Wheat, in this report, is
in a follower’s role.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 23.25 cents, or
5.1 percent, to $4.8025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest increase since Oct. 12. The most-active contract
gained 3.5 percent in the second quarter, partly on speculation
that world production will fall because of wet weather in the
U.S. and Canada, the world’s biggest wheat shippers.  
 As much as six times normal precipitation fell on growing
areas of the U.S., delaying the harvest, and abnormally large
amounts of rain fell on the western Prairies of Canada, curbing
seeding and damaging crops.  
 Milling wheat traded in Paris rose the most in more than a
year on concern that warmer temperatures in France, the European
Union’s biggest producer, will curb yields.  
 Wheat for November delivery on the NYSE Liffe exchange in
Paris closed 3.6 percent higher at 145.75 euros ($178.66) a
metric ton, the biggest jump since the contract started trading
in March 2009.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
