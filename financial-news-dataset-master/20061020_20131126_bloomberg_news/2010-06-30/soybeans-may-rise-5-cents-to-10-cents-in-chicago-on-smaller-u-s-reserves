             Soybeans may rise 5 cents to 10
cents a bushel after the government said U.S. reserves on June 1
were smaller than analysts expected, said  Mark Schultz  at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co.  
 Soybeans from last year’s harvest totaled 571 million
bushels as of June 1, down 4.2 percent from 596 million a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report.
That’s the smallest inventory since 2004. Eight analysts in a
Bloomberg survey expected 592 million bushels, on average.
