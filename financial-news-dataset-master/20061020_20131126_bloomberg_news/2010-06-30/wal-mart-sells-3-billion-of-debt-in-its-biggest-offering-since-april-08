             Wal-Mart Stores Inc ., the world’s
largest retailer, sold $3 billion of debt in its biggest dollar-
denominated bond transaction since April 2008.  
 The company sold $750 million of five-year notes that yield
53 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1.5
billion of 10-year debt that pays 70 basis points more than
benchmarks and $750 million of 30-year bonds at a 108 basis-
point spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Wal-Mart tapped the U.S. bond market for a second time this
year, after issuing $2 billion of notes in March, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based
store operator may be raising capital to fund share repurchases,
 Carol Levenson , director of research at Gimme Credit LLC, said
in a note today.  
 The company “is a rarity among retailers by virtue of its
extremely high and stable credit quality and financial
flexibility,” Levenson wrote. “It does take some nerve to
launch a corporate bond amid the current volatile markets, but
who better than Wal-Mart to test the waters?”  
 Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,  Greg Rossiter , a company spokesman, said today by telephone from
Bentonville, declining to comment further.  
 Stock Buyback Plans  
 Wal-Mart, which operates in 15 countries, announced a $15
billion share buyback program earlier this month and said it
purchased a company record $3 billion of stock, consisting of
55.6 million shares, in the first quarter. The retailer has
benefited from growth in Mexico, Canada and China, as sales
declined at U.S. stores amid the worst recession since the
1930s. In March, Wal-Mart boosted its annual dividend by 11
percent to $1.21.  
 Bonds issued by Wal-Mart have been the third-best
performers this month through yesterday among the 50-biggest
U.S. investment-grade borrowers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data show. The debt has surged 3.76 percent, trailing bonds
issued by Altria Group Inc., which rose 3.78 percent, and
American International Group Inc., which gained 4.8 percent.  
 Wal-Mart has $1.25 billion of 4.125 percent notes maturing
tomorrow, and $800 million of 4.75 percent debt due in August,
Bloomberg data show. It has $3.36 billion of bonds maturing next
year.  
 In April 2008, Wal-Mart sold $1 billion of 5-year notes and
$2 billion of 30-year bonds, the data show.  
 Wal-Mart’s Rating  
 Wal-Mart’s issue is the biggest debt sale by a non-
financial U.S. company since Discovery Communications sold $3
billion of debt on May 26, Bloomberg data show.  
 The average U.S. investment-grade bond paid a 209 basis
point spread as of yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate Master index.  
 Moody’s Investors Service assigns Wal-Mart a grade of Aa2,
two levels below the top investment-grade rating, and Standard &
Poor’s ranks it an equivalent AA.  
 Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the sale, Bloomberg Data show.
