             Women hold about 7 percent of Italy’s
corporate management positions, compared with an average of 30
percent to 35 percent in other developed nations, according to a
study by research firm Gea-Consulenti Associati.  
 Women hold 809 of the 11,730 management jobs at the 1,800
companies in the study, Milan-based  Gea  said in a statement
today. Of those positions, 36 percent are top-level jobs
including chief executive and chairman roles.  
 A lack of financial support for working mothers is forcing
Italian women to choose between careers and families, leading to
the lowest level of female employment in the European Union,
according to data from Eurostat, the EU’s Luxembourg-based
statistics office.  Silvio Berlusconi , after being elected prime
minister for the third time in 2008, appointed a record four
women to his then 12-member cabinet.  
 Fininvest SpA Chairman  Marina Berlusconi , the prime
minister’s oldest daughter, is ranked 33rd in Forbes Magazine’s
list of the world’s 100 most powerful women. She also sits on
the board of Mediobanca SpA, Italy’s largest publicly traded
investment bank and is the only Italian on the Forbes list.  
 South Korea and Japan have the worst record for pay
equality between the sexes in a sample of 21 member countries of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
according to a March 8 report. That study didn’t include Italy.
