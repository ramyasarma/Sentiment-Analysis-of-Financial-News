             Dubai shares declined, leading the
drop in the Gulf, after a slump in U.S. consumer confidence
fueled concern about the global economic recovery.  Shuaa Capital
PSC  fell as the head of its brokerage division resigned.  
 The  DFM General Index  lost 1.4 percent to 1,461.8, the
lowest since February 2009. The gauge fell 21 percent this
quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2008. Investment
bank Shuaa slid the most in a week and  Emirates NBD PJSC 
dropped. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  retreated 0.8 percent and
in North Africa, Egypt’s gauge declined a seventh day. Crude has
fallen 9.5 percent this quarter, as of 5:24 p.m. in Dubai.  
 Declines are “in line with the global backdrop,” said  Ali Khan , head of cash-equity trading at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital
Ltd. “Focus is returning to the euro zone, disappointing data
in the U.S. and weaker oil.”  
 Emerging-market stocks decreased after the U.S. Conference
Board’s gauge of confidence among U.S. consumers fell to 52.9
this month from a revised 62.7 in May as Americans became
pessimistic about the outlook for the labor market and the
economy. The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index slid 3.1 percent
yesterday, bringing the drop for the quarter to 11 percent.  
 Crude for August delivery declined as much as 0.8 percent
to $75.33 a barrel and last traded at $75.79 a barrel. The six
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil.  
 Shuaa Declines  
 Shuaa  lost 6.3 percent to 1.05 dirhams. The U.A.E.’s
biggest investment bank said  Mohammed Ali Yasin , chief executive
officer of its brokerage division, will leave the company at the
end of August.  
 “Any high profile exit will likely test investor
confidence, especially in this highly sensitive and volatile
market,” said  Saud Masud , a Dubai-based analyst at UBS AG.  
 Emirates NBD, the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank by
assets, fell 2.8 percent to 2.43 dirhams, the lowest since March
7 and  Emaar Properties PJSC  slid for a third day, losing 1.3
percent to 3.06 dirhams, the lowest since June 17.  
 Egypt’s EGX 30 Index benchmark fell for the seventh day,
its longest losing streak in a year. The measure slid 1.4
percent to 6,033.09, bringing the slump for the quarter to 11
percent.  
 Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  fell 0.2 percent, Bahrain’s  gauge  slid
0.4 percent and the  QE Index  in Qatar dropped 1 percent. Abu
Dhabi’s  measure , Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  and
 Kuwait SE Price Index  decreased 0.7 percent.
