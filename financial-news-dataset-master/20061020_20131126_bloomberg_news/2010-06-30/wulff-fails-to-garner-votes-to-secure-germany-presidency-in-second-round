             German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
candidate, Christian Wulff, failed to win enough votes to secure
the German presidency in a second round of voting in Berlin
today.  
 Wulff won 615 votes in the 1,244-member assembly, while the
opposition candidate, Joachim Gauck, got 490 votes. A third
candidate, Luc Jochimsen, won 123 votes. A first round earlier
today also produced no winner.  
 Voting will now go to a third round, also to be held today.
A total of 623 votes was needed to win in the second round. In
the third round, the candidate with the most votes wins.
