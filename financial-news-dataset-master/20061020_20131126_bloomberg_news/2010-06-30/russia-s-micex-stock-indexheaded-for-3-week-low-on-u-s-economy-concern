             Russian stocks slid to their lowest
level in three weeks after a slump in U.S. consumer confidence
fueled concern the global recovery is faltering.  
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , the country’s largest miner, fell 4
percent and steelmaker  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel  dropped 1.4
percent. The 30-stock  Micex Index  slipped 1.1 percent to
1,309.31 at the close in Moscow, taking its loss this quarter to
9.7 percent. Stocks erased gains of as much as 0.4 percent today
after the central bank kept its key rates on hold. The ruble was
little changed against the dollar at 31.2550, down 6.1 percent
in the quarter.  
 Emerging-market stocks fell as investors sold riskier
assets after an unexpected drop yesterday in U.S. consumer
confidence added to concern sparked by the revision of an
economic indicator for China. Oil, Russia’s key export earner,
slid 21 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $75.73 a barrel.  
 “Russia is still trading around the external concerns
about the growth in China and U.S. consumer confidence,”  Tom Mundy , a strategist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow, said by
phone today.  
 President Barack Obama said the U.S. economy faces
“headwinds” from Europe’s debt crisis after a meeting
yesterday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. The
U.S. Conference Board’s gauge of confidence among U.S. consumers
slumped to 52.9 this month from a revised 62.7 in May.  
 Interest Rate  
       OAO Severstal , the country’s largest miner, fell 2.2
percent to 308.09 rubles.  OAO Rosneft , Russia’s largest oil
producer, retreated 1 percent to 192.79 rubles, its lowest level
in more than 10 months.  OAO Lukoil,  the country’s biggest non-
state oil company, dropped 1.6 percent to 1,621.56 rubles.  
 Bank Rossii left its refinancing rate at a record low 7.75
percent, it said on its website today, as forecast by all 15
economists in a Bloomberg survey. It also kept the repurchase
rate charged on one- and seven-day loans unchanged at 6.75
percent. The regulator last trimmed rates on May 31.  
 OAO Polyus Gold , the country’s largest gold producer,
advanced to its highest in almost seven months, rising 3.5
percent to 1,632.02 rubles, after announcing plans to merge with
KazakhGold Group Ltd.
