             Defending champion Roger Federer
lost the third set against Tomas Berdych today to trail 2-1 in
their Wimbledon tennis quarterfinal.  
 The Swiss, seeking to tie Pete Sampras’s Open era men’s
record of seven titles at the All England Club, last failed to
reach the final in 2002. Berdych of the Czech Republic leads 6-
4, 3-6, 6-1 on Centre Court.  
 Federer is ranked No. 2 on the ATP Tour, although is seeded
No. 1 at Wimbledon.
