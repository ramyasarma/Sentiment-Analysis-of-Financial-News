             Moody’s Investors Service is
“optimistic” on Colombia because President-elect  Juan Manuel Santos  plans to create a fiscal stabilization fund and enjoys
“strong” support in Congress, analyst  Alessandra Alecci  said.  
 “All these factors have us optimistic about the country
and we are going to be looking at it very carefully in the next
few months,” Alecci said in a phone interview today from New
York. “There is definitely potential for Colombia to move
towards investment grade.”  
 Moody’s rates Colombia’s foreign debt Ba1, or one level
below investment grade. It has a stable outlook on the rating.
Standard & Poor’s rates the nation’s foreign bonds at BBB-, the
lowest level of investment grade, and the government at BB+, one
step below. Colombia is rated BB+ by Fitch Ratings.  
 Colombia’s peso bond rose, pushing benchmark yields to
their lowest level since April 2006, on speculation an upgrade
would lure more foreign investors to the country’s debt,
according to  Julian Cardenas , head analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.75
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. That’s the
lowest level on a closing basis since April 3, 2006. The bond’s
price jumped 0.698 centavos to 122.127 centavos per peso.  
 ‘Very Strong Support’  
 The peso rose the most in seven weeks, jumping 1.1 percent
to 1,900.11 per U.S. dollar, from 1,920.35 yesterday.  
 Santos’s “very strong” support in Congress will help the
South American nation pass reforms that will allow it to address
a widening budget deficit, according to Alecci. Santos will take
over a government on Aug. 7 that’s forecast to have a
consolidated budget deficit of 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product, the biggest since 2002.  
 Santos named former cabinet colleague  Juan Carlos Echeverry 
as finance minister on June 21, charging him with balancing the
budget by 2014. Echeverry has said the new administration will
create a stabilization fund using royalties from oil and coal
sales.  
 After Colombia’s Conservative and Radical Change parties
endorsed Santos following the first-round vote, Santos has about
70 percent of backing in Congress, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG.  
 ‘Encouraging’  
 The “very strong” Congressional support “means if they
want to tackle certain reforms they can do it,” said Alecci.
Colombia’s increased oil output is also “very encouraging,”
she said.  
 Colombia lost its investment grade rating with Moody’s
eleven years ago when insurgent violence and a banking crisis
helped trigger six straight quarters of contraction between 1998
and 1999. S&P also cut Colombia below investment grade in 1999.  
 As President  Alvaro Uribe ’s defense minister from 2006 to
2009, Santos oversaw some of the biggest defeats for the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, including a
2008 raid in Ecuador that killed the rebel group’s No. 2 leader,
 Raul Reyes . Uribe’s security policies helped almost halve the
number of murders and slash kidnappings 93 percent by 2009,
spurring economic gains. The economy grew at its fastest pace in
three decades in 2007 and attracted a record $10.6 billion in
 foreign direct investment  in 2008.  
 The government expects the economy to grow 3 percent this
year and 4 percent in 2011, while forecasting foreign direct
investment to reach $10 billion this year.  
 “We’re going to look in the next few months because
there’s a new administration and they are likely to announce
their policies and we want to see what they are,” Alecci said.
