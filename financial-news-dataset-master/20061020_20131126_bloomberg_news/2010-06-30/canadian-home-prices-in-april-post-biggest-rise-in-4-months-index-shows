             Canadian home prices posted their
biggest monthly increase in four months in April, the  Teranet-
National Bank  Composite House Price Index showed.  
 Prices rose 0.8 percent during the month, led by Halifax,
Ottawa and Montreal, according to a report released today by
National Bank Financial. On an annual basis, prices rose 12.9
percent, led by Toronto’s 17 percent gain.  
 The index has tracked home-price changes in six Canadian
cities -- Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary and
Vancouver -- since February 2000. For the first time in eight
months, all of the six cities surveyed showed a monthly increase
of more than 0.5 percent.
