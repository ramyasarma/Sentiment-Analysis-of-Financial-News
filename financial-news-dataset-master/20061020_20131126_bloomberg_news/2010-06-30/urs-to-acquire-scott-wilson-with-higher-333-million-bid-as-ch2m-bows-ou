             URS Corp. , a U.S. engineering-
advisory company, agreed to buy U.K.-based  Scott Wilson Group
Plc  after sweetening its offer to about 223 million pounds ($333
million) to trump a competing proposal from CH2M Hill Cos.  
 The purchase is for 290 pence a share, URS and Scott Wilson
said today in a statement. Closely held CH2M of Englewood,
Colorado, said it withdrew its bid.  
 The moves ended a bidding war for Basingstoke, England-
based Scott Wilson, an engineering adviser whose projects
include London’s Crossrail train line. CH2M offered 189 million
pounds on June 28, hours after Scott Wilson accepted a 161
million-pound bid from San Francisco-based URS.  
 “URS’s higher bid is justified based on what we see as
expanded growth prospects,”  Stewart Scharf , a Standard & Poor’s
equity analyst in London, said today in a note to clients. He
recommends buying URS shares.  
 URS and Scott Wilson said their boards approved the
transaction.  
 URS fell 24 cents to $39.35 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Scott Wilson rose 5 pence to 266
pence in London trading before the new URS offer was announced.
