             India’s monsoon, the main source of
irrigation for the nation’s 235 million farmers, was 15 percent
below average until yesterday, the weather office said.  
 The nation received 132.5 millimeters of rain in the June 1
to June 29 period, the India Meteorological Department said on
its website. That’s less than the 155.3 millimeters average
considered normal for the period.
