             Poland’s central bank, meeting for
the first time under Governor  Marek Belka , left the benchmark
interest rate at a record low for a 12th month and forecast
inflation will stay under control as the economy accelerates.  
 The Narodowy Bank Polski held the seven-day reference rate
at 3.5 percent, in line with the forecasts of all 17 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  
 A year of low borrowing costs following a combined 2.5
percentage-point reduction helped Poland’s economy, the largest
of the European Union’s eastern members, avoid recession in 2009
and accelerate this year. The central bank raised its forecasts
for economic growth in 2010-2012 and for inflation this year and
in 2011, while lowering the projection for 2012, according to
post-meeting statement by the Monetary Policy Council.  
 “We’re not very worried by the projections,” Belka told
reporters at a news briefing. “The council took a look at new
factors that may increase inflation pressure in the medium term.
That can be taken as an indication of where our attention will
be focused.”  
 Belka said those “new factors” include a more volatile
zloty, which has “destabilized” the currency’s long-term
tendency to appreciate. The zloty has lost almost 7 percent
since April 9, when the bank bought foreign currency to lower
the Polish currency from a 16-month high.  
 At 5:21 p.m., the zloty was trading at 4.1287, unchanged
from its level just before the 1:35 p.m. rate announcement and
up 0.3 percent on the day.  
 Tightening Nears  
 “Policy makers may have changed their view after recent
data showing the recovery is gathering speed both in Poland and
abroad,” said Marcin Mazurek, an economist at BRE Bank in
Warsaw. “The moment to start thinking about rate tightening is
nearing and I’d be interested to know if some members still
think it should start with a ‘corrective’ increase of 50 basis
points.”  
 Missing was the Monetary Policy Council’s summary of the
balance of risks to its 2.5 percent annual inflation target,
which had been a fixture in post-meeting statements since 2004.
Analysts had used the sentence to gauge whether the bank’s
policy bias was neutral or tilted toward higher or lower rates.  
 ‘Different Way’  
 “Please treat this as a change resulting from the
appointment of a new Governor, who has chosen to communicate
with the market in a different way,” Belka said.  
 Poland’s central bank increased its projection for 2010
gross domestic product growth to between 2.5 percent and 3.9
percent, compared with its previous February forecast of between
2.1 percent and 4.1 percent. For 2011, the bank boosted its
growth forecast to between 3.3 percent and 5.9 percent from the
previous projection of between 1.8 percent and 4 percent.  
 The inflation forecast was increased for both this year and
2011, when the central bank projected annual price increases
from 2.1 percent to 3.3 percent. At the far end of the bank’s
two-year policy horizon, in 2012, projected inflation was
reduced to between 2.2 percent and 3.7 percent from the previous
forecast of between 2.6 percent and 4.6 percent.  
 “It’s surprising that a significant acceleration of GDP in
2011 doesn’t generate serious inflation pressure in the
projection,” said  Adam Antoniak , a senior economist at BPH Bank
in Warsaw, which predicts the central bank will raise rates by
25 basis points this year.  
 Below Target  
 In May, inflation was below the central bank’s 2.5 percent
target for a second month at 2.2 percent, the slowest since
August 2007. Still, output rose an annual 14 percent in May, the
fastest pace in 25 months, retail sales increased 4.3 percent,
more than economists expected,  unemployment  declined and
salaries advanced.  
 Economic growth eased to 3 percent in the first quarter
from 3.3 percent in the last three months of 2009 and the
second-quarter pace may be slower because of damage caused by
floods in May and June.  
 Spending on repairs to that damage may bolster economic
growth by 1 percentage point, with half the money spent next
year, according to  Mateusz Szczurek , chief economist at ING Bank
in Warsaw.  
 Szczurek forecasts second-half economic expansion of 3.1
percent to 3.3 percent, revising his full-year forecast to 3.1
percent from 2.7 percent.
