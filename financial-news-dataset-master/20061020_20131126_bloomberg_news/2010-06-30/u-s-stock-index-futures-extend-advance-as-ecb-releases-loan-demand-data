             U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after the European Central Bank said banks sought 131.9
billion euros ($161.8 billion) in three-month loans as a 12-
month facility expires, less than some economists had expected.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September added 0.7 percent to 1,042.7 as of 10:22 a.m. in
London.
