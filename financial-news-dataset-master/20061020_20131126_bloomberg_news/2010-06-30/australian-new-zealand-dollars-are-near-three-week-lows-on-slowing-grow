             The Australian dollar fell for a
fourth day, reaching the lowest level in three weeks, after
economic reports at home and abroad signaled growth is slowing.  
 The New Zealand dollar earlier declined as expansion in
China’s manufacturing slowed for a second month. Building
approvals in Australia unexpectedly dropped in May while retail
sales growth weakened. Global stocks slid as investors sold
higher-yielding assets as U.S. data on manufacturing and home
sales trailed economists’ estimates and initial jobless claims
rose.  
 “You can see the Aussie back down to 80 cents and further
losses in equity markets,” said  Thomas Averill , a senior
consultant in Sydney at HiFX, a currency risk management firm.
“Into the weekend it would be a very brave person that’s long
risk, so you’re either going to be short or standing on the
sidelines.” A short is a bet an asset will decline.  
 Australia’s currency fell 0.7 percent to 83.52 U.S. cents,
from 84.08, at 11:15 a.m. in New York. It touched 83.16 U.S.,
the lowest level since June 10. The currency slid 2.1 percent to
72.81 yen.  
 New Zealand’s dollar fell as much as 0.8 percent to 67.95
U.S. cents, also the weakest since June 10, before trading at
68.50. It fell 1.4 percent to 59.70 yen.  
 Australian home-building approvals fell 6.6 percent in May,
compared with economists’ median forecast for no change.  Retail
sales  rose 0.2 percent, a third of the pace in April, the
statistics bureau said. That was less than the 0.3 percent
retail sales advance economists had predicted for May in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 Payrolls, Manufacturing  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index  of shares fell 1.4 percent,
extending a nearly 10 percent second-quarter slump. China’s
Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 52.1 in June from 53.9 the
previous month, the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
today. That was less than the 53.2 median forecast by economists
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell to a 10-month intraday
low as a gauge of manufacturing fell to 56.2 in June from 59.7 a
month earlier pending and new home sales plunged 30 percent in
May, more than twice as much as forecast.  
 U.S. Labor Department data today showed initial claims for
U.S. unemployment benefits increased by 13,000 to 472,000 in the
week ended June 26, compared to the median forecast for 455,000
in a Bloomberg News survey. A report tomorrow will show U.S.
payrolls fell by 125,000 in June, according to a separate 
survey.
