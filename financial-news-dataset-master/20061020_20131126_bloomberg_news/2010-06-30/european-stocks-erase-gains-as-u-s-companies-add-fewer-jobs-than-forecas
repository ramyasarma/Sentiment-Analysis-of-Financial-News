             European stocks declined, erasing
earlier gains, as a private report showed U.S. companies added
fewer jobs than forecast.  
 Rio Tinto Group led a gauge of basic-resources shares to
the biggest drop among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Verbund AG slid 6 percent after Austria’s largest
utility announced plans to sell as much as 1 billion euros
($1.22 billion) of shares.  
 The Stoxx 600 fell 0.2 percent to 243.33 at 1:44 p.m. in
London, having earlier climbed as much as 0.7 percent. The gauge
has fallen 7.7 percent since the end of March and is on course
for its first quarterly drop since the rally in global equities
began in March 2009.  
 Companies in the U.S. added fewer workers in June than
forecast, according to data from a private report based on
payrolls. The 13,000 gain followed a revised 57,000 increase the
prior month, figures from ADP Employer Services showed today.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast an increase
of 60,000, according to the median estimate.  
 Banks limited declines in the Stoxx 600 after European
lenders sought less three-month money than forecast at a
European Central Bank tender. National Bank of Greece SA gained
3.1 percent to 9.07 euros.  
 Rio Tinto, the world’s third-biggest mining company, slid
2.1 percent to 2,985 pence, the lowest level since May 25.
Verbund dropped 6 percent to 25.20 euros.
