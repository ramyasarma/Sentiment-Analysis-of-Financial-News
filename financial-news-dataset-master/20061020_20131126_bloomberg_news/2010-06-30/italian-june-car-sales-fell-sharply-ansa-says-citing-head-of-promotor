             Italian car sales fell sharply in
June, news agency Ansa reported, citing the head of auto
industry research firm Promotor.  
 “It will be a little worse than May and April, a double-
digit decline,” Gian Primo Quagliano, the head of Promotor, was
quoted as saying at a Milan conference. Italy’s Transport
Ministry releases June car sales figures tomorrow.
