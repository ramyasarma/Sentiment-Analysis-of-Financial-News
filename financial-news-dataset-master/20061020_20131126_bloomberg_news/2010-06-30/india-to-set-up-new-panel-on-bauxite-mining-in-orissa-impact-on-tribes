             India will immediately set up a new
four-member panel to consider proposals to mine bauxite in
districts of the eastern state of Orissa, including the
potential impact on tribal communities, the Environment Ministry
said in a statement today.  
 The panel will review all previous reports relating to the
use of forest land for mining in the districts of Kalahandi and
Rayagada, the statement said. The committee will give its
findings within 30 days of its formation.  
 Vedanta Resources Plc. wants to mine bauxite in the state.
