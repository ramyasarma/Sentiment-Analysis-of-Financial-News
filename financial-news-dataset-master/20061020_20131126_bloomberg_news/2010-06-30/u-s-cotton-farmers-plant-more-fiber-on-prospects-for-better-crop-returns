             U.S. farmers seeded 3.8 percent
more cotton than forecast in March, spurred on by the
prospect for higher returns than corn and soybeans.  
 About 10.909 million acres (4.41 million hectares)
were planted with the fiber, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said, up from a March forecast of 10.505
million that was based on a survey of growers’ intentions.
The seeded area, the first increase since 2006, would be up
19 percent from last year and the biggest jump since 1995.  
 “They’ve expanded acreage everywhere they can find to
expand it in Texas,”  Mike Stevens , an independent trader
in Mandeville, Louisiana, said in a telephone interview
last week. “It’s the best opportunity cotton producers
have had in West Texas in a lifetime, with prices and
conditions so conducive to a good crop.”  
 Cotton prices have rallied 3.3 percent this year,
while corn futures declined 17 percent and soybeans dropped
13 percent.  
 “Cotton futures prices and contract opportunities
remained good during spring and into planting season while
other crop prices seemed to weaken somewhat,”  Don Shurley ,
a professor and cotton economist at the University of
Georgia in Tifton, said in an e-mail last week. “Prices
remaining attractive likely have resulted in some acres
intended for corn and soybeans shifting to cotton.”  
 Analysts’ Estimate  
 The average estimate of 12 analysts and traders in a
Bloomberg News survey was for 10.8 million acres of cotton
sown this year. As of June 27, 62 percent of the U.S. crop
was in good to excellent condition, versus 42 percent a
year earlier, the USDA said this week.  
 Last year, plantings fell to 9.15 million acres, the
least since 1983, USDA data show. Farmers ended up
harvesting about 7.529 million acres, the department said.  
 Today’s report is based on a survey of farmers
nationwide conducted during the first two weeks of June.  
 Growers in Texas, the biggest cotton-producing state,
planted 5.718 million acres, up 14 percent from last year,
the USDA said. In Alabama, California, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, planted acreage
surged over 30 percent.  
 The U.S. is the world’s third-biggest cotton exporter
and producer, after China and India.  
 Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.32 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to 78.13 cents a pound yesterday on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The most-active contract has
gained 3.3 percent this year.
