             “ The Twilight Saga: Eclipse ,” the
third film in Summit Entertainment LLC’s teen-vampire series,
generated record sales of more than $30 million from midnight
showings in U.S. and Canadian theaters.  
 “Eclipse” surpassed the previous record of $26.3 million
set last year by “The Twilight Saga: New Moon,” the second
film in the franchise based on  Stephenie Meyer ’s books, the
Santa Monica, California-based studio said today in an e-mail.  
 The first two “Twilight” films earned more than $1.1
billion in global ticket sales, according to researcher  Box
Office Mojo . “Eclipse” may take in as much as $175 million
over the five days ending July 4, based on the estimate of
Jeffrey Hartke, a Hollywood Stock Exchange analyst.  
 “Eclipse” is opening today in a record 4,416 theaters,
besting “Iron Man 2” when it made its debut on May 7 in 4,380
theaters, according to researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office. More
than 4,000 theaters offered midnight showings of “Eclipse,”
Summit said.  
 Summit executives weren’t available to comment, spokesman
 Paul Pflug  said in an e-mail.  
 Summit plans two more movies based on Meyer’s fourth book,
“Breaking Dawn.” The films focus on Bella Swan, a teenager
whose move to a small town puts her in the company of vampires
and werewolves. In “Eclipse,” Swan, played by  Kristen Stewart ,
must choose between two suitors, vampire Edward Cullen and
werewolf Jacob Black.
