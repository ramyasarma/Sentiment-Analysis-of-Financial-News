             Murjani Group , the Indian franchisee
for Tommy Hilfiger and  Calvin Klein , will set up 500 Hilfiger
accessories stores in the next five years as rising incomes
allow people to spend more on watches, clothes and belts.  
 Murjani, which opened the first Hilfiger store in 2004,
will also double the number of places it sells the brand’s
apparel to 2,000 in five years, Chairman Mohan Murjani said by
phone from Mumbai. The accessories stores will sell watches,
belts, wallets and stationery.  
 Increasing incomes, urbanization and awareness about
western brands is helping Hilfiger and other western brands to
boost sales in a nation where revenue from selling apparel is
predicted to more than double to as much as $55 billion in 2015,
 according to consultant McKinsey & Co . Indians spend the most on
buying clothes after food, with apparel accounting for about 10
percent of total retail sales in India, McKinsey said.  
 Murjani sells Hilfiger in 98 cities in India through about
1,000 stores. Murjani, which set up its first retail store in
Shanghai in 1930, owns the rights to sell Hilfiger, Calvin Klein
and  French Connection  in India. The group also owns a luxury
mall in Mumbai.  
 New York-based  Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.  said in March it
agreed to buy Hilfiger from private-equity firm Apax Partners LP
for about $3 billion.
