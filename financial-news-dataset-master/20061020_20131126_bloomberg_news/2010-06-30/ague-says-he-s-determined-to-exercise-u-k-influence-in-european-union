             Foreign Secretary  William Hague  will
say he is “determined” to increase the U.K.’s influence in the
European Union by securing more posts for British officials in
institutions run by the 27-nation bloc.  
 “It is mystifying to us that the previous government
failed to give due weight to the exercise of British influence
in the EU,” Hague will say today in London in his first major
foreign-policy speech since taking power last month, according
to excerpts released in advance by his  office .  
 The outgoing Labour government “neglected to ensure that
sufficient numbers of bright British officials entered EU
institutions, and so we now face a generation gap developing in
the British presence in parts of the EU,” Hague will say.  
 Britain’s place in Europe divided Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party in the 1980s and 1990s and led to
the downfall of Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher  in 1990. Like
her successor,  John Major , Cameron -- and his Foreign Secretary
Hague -- face the quandary of how to make deals in Brussels
without upsetting a domestic party traditionally hostile to the
EU.  
 Today Hague will also set out how Britain will extend its
“global reach and influence” and reveal that he communicates
with “quite a lot of” his foreign ministerial counterparts by
text message, according to the excerpts.
