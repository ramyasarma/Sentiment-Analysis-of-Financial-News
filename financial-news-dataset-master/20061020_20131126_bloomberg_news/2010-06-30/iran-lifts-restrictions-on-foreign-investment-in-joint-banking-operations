             Iran lifted a cap on the percentage
of shares in Iranian banks that can be owned by a foreign
individual or company, the government said.  
 President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  signed an order on June 27
for government departments, including the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, to implement the banking-law amendment approved by
the parliament in May, the government said today on its  website .  
 The original law, which applied to both Iranians and
foreigners, restricted the amount of shares in a bank that a
single company could own to 10 percent and an individual to 5
percent. Iranian ownership of banks is still subject to the
limits, the government said.  
 The U.S. Congress on June 24 approved sanctions on Iran
that bar access to the American financial system for banks that
do business with the country. The measures also punish foreign
suppliers of gasoline to Iran. The U.S. action and United
Nations sanctions approved on June 9 are aimed at curbing Iran’s
nuclear development.  
 The government said it proposed the amendment to parliament
to encourage investment.
