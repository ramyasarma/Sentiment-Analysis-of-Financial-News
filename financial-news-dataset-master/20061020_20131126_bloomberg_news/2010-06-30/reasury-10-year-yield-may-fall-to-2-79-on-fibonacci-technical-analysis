             Treasury 10-year  yields  are poised
to fall to 2.79 percent from today’s 2.95 percent, according to
Daiwa Asset Management Co., citing trading patterns.  
 A Fibonacci graph based on the rate shows 2.79 percent is
a 38.2 percent retracement of an increase that started at a
record low on Dec. 18, 2008, and ended April 5.  
 “It’s the next target,” said  Tsutomu Komiya , who helps
oversee $77 billion as an investor for Daiwa in Tokyo, part of
Japan’s second-largest brokerage. “Yields will go down.”  
 The rate declined below 3.02 percent, the 50 percent
retracement level, on June 28. According to Fibonacci analysis,
a break of one level indicates the yield will move to the next.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on a formula developed by 13th
century mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who
discovered the sequence while studying the reproduction rate of
 rabbits .  
 In financial markets, analysts use the indicator to
determine levels where buy and sell orders may be clustered.
