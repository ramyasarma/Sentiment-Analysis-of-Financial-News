             Monsanto Co. , the world’s largest
seed company, said fiscal third-quarter  profit  fell less than
analysts estimated as U.S. growers planted more genetically
modified crops.  
 Net income  in the three months through May declined 45
percent to $384 million, or 70 cents a share, from $694 million,
or $1.25, a year earlier, St. Louis-based Monsanto said today in
a statement. Per-share profit excluding some items was 81 cents,
topping the 79-cent  average estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 6.3 percent to $2.96 billion.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Hugh Grant  increased sales of
cotton and soybean seeds, helping to make up for price cuts in
Roundup, the world’s best-selling herbicide. Third-quarter sales
from all seeds and genetic licenses gained 5.1 percent, Monsanto
said.  
 Monsanto rose 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $47.41 as of 8:13
in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The shares 
dropped 42 percent this year before today.
