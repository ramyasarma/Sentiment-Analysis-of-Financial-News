             Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.
Chairman Ronald Arculli said recent stock market declines in
Hong Kong were due mainly to external forces and not the looming
initial public offering of Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  
 “The size of IPO is big, but there’s still plenty of
liquidity in the market,” Arculli said at an investor
conference in Hong Kong. “So there’s a psychological impact
rather than actual impact.”  
 The market is “most being affected by external factors.”  
 Agricultural Bank may raise as much as $20.1 billion with a
dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
