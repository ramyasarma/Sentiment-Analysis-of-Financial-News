             U.S. stocks fell, extending the
market’s first quarterly retreat in more than a year, after
Moody’s Investors Service’s warning that it may downgrade Spain
snuffed out an earlier rally.  
 Alcoa Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Hewlett-Packard Co.. lost
more than 2 percent to lead losses in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Ford Motor Co. rallied after saying it will pay into a
union health-care fund.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 1.1 percent to
1,030.11 at 3:45 p.m. in New York. It has declined 12 percent
since March 31, breaking a four-quarter winning streak that
drove the benchmark index for U.S. stocks up 47 percent. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average fell 115.44 points, or 1.2 percent, to
9,754.86.  
 “It’s continued concerns with the economic slowdown and
global deterioration issues as highlighted by the Spanish
potential downgrade and the jobs data,” said  Wayne Wilbanks ,
chief investment officer at Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas in Norfolk,
Virginia, which manages $1.5 billion. “The glass is half empty
when you’re at the end of the quarter. There’s very little
buying support. It’s as much technical. 1,040 on the S&P,
everybody is looking at this number. Today’s our first real day
below 1,040.”  
 Concern Moody’s will downgrade Spain wiped out an advance
triggered by a report that business activity grew for a ninth
month and signs that European lenders are stronger than
investors speculated. The European Central Bank said it will
lend the region’s banks less money than economists had forecast.
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc.’s business
barometer showed manufacturing is overcoming turmoil in
financial markets.
