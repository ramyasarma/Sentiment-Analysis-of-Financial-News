             Hermann Prelle,  UBS AG’s  joint-head
of investment banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
will take a one-year sabbatical starting in September.  
 Simon Warshaw  will run investment banking for the region in
the interim, UBS told employees in an e-mail last week. A
spokesman for Switzerland’s largest bank confirmed the contents
of the e-mail today. He declined to comment further.  
 “Hermann has recently told us he wants to spend more time
with his family, and we have agreed to him taking a one-year
sabbatical starting from September,” the e-mail said.  
 Prelle joined UBS in 2000 from Credit Suisse Group AG,
where he headed German mergers. At UBS, Prelle worked on
transactions including Allianz SE’s $20 billion purchase of
Dresdner Bank AG in 2001, and advised clients in the utilities,
telecommunications, media, technology and banking industries.  
 UBS posted the biggest  quarterly profit  in almost three
years last month, as the investment bank had a pretax profit of
1.19 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) for the period. The
bank plans to hire “a handful of hundreds” of people in coming
quarters to expand the investment bank, Chief Financial Officer
 John Cryan  said in a Bloomberg TV interview in May.  
 The Zurich-based bank ranks 10th on providing global
mergers advice and 11th in Europe this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
