             Canada’s dollar fell to the lowest
level in more than three weeks after reports showed the nation’s
gross domestic product unexpectedly stalled in April and U.S.
employers added fewer jobs than economists predicted.  
 The currency fell for a third day as futures traders
trimmed bets for increases at each of the Bank of Canada’s four
remaining 2010 rate-setting meetings. The loonie, as the dollar
is sometimes referred to because of the waterfowl on the one-
dollar coin, had its first quarterly decline since the three
months ended in March 2009, dropping 4.6 percent.  
 “We seem to be in a choppier transition from recovery to
moderate expansion than anticipated,” said  David Watt,  senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital unit
in Toronto. “Canadian GDP highlights the slowdown in the second
quarter relative to the first, and is weighing on the outlook
for the Bank of Canada rate profile.”  
 The dollar depreciated 0.8 percent to C$1.0639 per U.S.
dollar, the weakest since June 7, at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It
closed at C$1.0560 yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys 93.99
U.S. cents.  
 Yields on December 2010 bankers’ acceptances, the most-
active contract, dropped as much as 3 basis points today to 1.19
percent, the lowest since Feb. 26 and are down from 2.05 percent
in April.  
 Futures Contracts  
 “Both the ADP numbers and Canadian GDP were soft,” which
sent Bax contracts higher, said  David Love , a trader of
interest-rate derivatives in Montreal at the brokerage Le Groupe
Jitney Inc. One buyer closing out a bet on a decline pushed the
contracts higher, sending yields lower, he said.  
 So-called Bax contracts have settled an  average  of about 20
basis points above the central bank’s overnight target since
1992, Bloomberg data show. Hedge funds and money managers use
the contracts to hedge against interest-rate exposure and make
bets. Yields fall as prices rise.  
 Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  on June 1 became the
first Group of Seven central banker to raise interest rates,
increasing the target level to 0.5 percent from a record low
0.25 percent. Policy makers next meet on July 20 to set rates,
then again in September, October and December.  
 Economists cut forecasts this month for the benchmark rate
to 1.25 percent by year-end and 2 percent by mid-2011, from
forecasts last month of 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent,
respectively, according to the weighted average of estimates in
Bloomberg surveys.  
 ‘Traditional Safe Havens’  
 Canada’s economic output remained at a seasonally adjusted
annualized rate of C$1.23 trillion ($1.16 trillion) in April,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, versus a median forecast
for a 0.2 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Companies in the U.S. added 13,000 workers in June, data
from a private report based on payrolls said. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast a gain of 60,000,
according to the median estimate.  
 “Risk does not look attractive and more traditional safe
havens are coming to the fore,” said RBC’s Watt, citing the
yen, greenback and Swiss franc. “The Canadian dollar looks like
a safe haven amid turbulence so long as the overall growth
outlook remains stable, and that isn’t the case right now.”  
 Canada’s 10-year bond  yield  fell as much as 4 basis points
to 3.062 percent, the lowest level since May 6, 2009. It reached
a high for the year of 3.751 percent in April. The 3.5 percent
security due in June 2020 rose 14 cents to C$103.57 and yielded
3.08 percent.  
 The nation’s sovereign debt returned 1.3 percent this
month, 3.7 percent in the second quarter and 4.6 percent so far
in 2010, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
