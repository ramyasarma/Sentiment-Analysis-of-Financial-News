             Stocks in the U.S. are the cheapest
relative to bonds in three decades, a sign it’s time to buy
after the biggest equity retreat since the bull market began 15
months ago, according to  Michael Darda , the chief economist for
MKM Partners LLC.  
 Income  for Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies may reach
$92 a share in 2010 excluding capital gains and losses, giving
the index an earnings yield of 8.8 percent, said Darda, whose
Stamford, Connecticut-based firm advises about 400 institutional
clients. That’s the highest relative to the interest rate on
investment-grade debt since the 1970s, according to data
compiled by MKM.  
 “Stocks are the most attractive asset class out there, bar
none,” Darda said in a telephone interview. “These indicators
together tell me that growth is going to continue, so I’m not in
the double-dip camp. Jobs growth will continue, corporate
earnings will continue.”  
 Rising earnings provide a margin of safety as stock charts
monitored by analysts signal the U.S. economy may be poised for
the second contraction in three years. The decline in the S&P
500 to an intraday low for 2010 yesterday and a  convergence  in
the index’s 50-day and 200-day averages may foreshadow further
weakening, according to  David Rosenberg  of Gluskin Sheff &
Associates Inc. in Toronto.  
 2010 Low  
 Stocks  plunged  yesterday after a report showed American
consumer confidence slumped, pushing the benchmark index for
U.S. equities to the lowest level of 2010. The S&P 500 slid 3.1
percent to 1,041.24 as 499 stocks fell. Today, it retreated 1
percent to 1,030.71. The index’s 15 percent drop since April 23
is the biggest since the bull market began in March 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Darda,  Barton Biggs  of Traxis Partners LP and Gamco
Investors Inc.’s  Howard Ward  say the economy is expanding fast
enough to sustain earnings growth, making stocks a bargain.
Profits among S&P 500 companies are forecast to rise 31 percent
to $81.27 a share in 2010, according to more than 2,000 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income would still be 11
percent below the all-time high of $89.81 a share reached in
2007. The  index  trades at 12.7 times projected profit in 2010,
the lowest since March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Tax Returns  
 Darda calculates earnings yield using a measure known as
 NIPA , or national income and product accounts, compiled by the
U.S. Commerce Department that excludes capital gains and bad
debt provisions. The data is based on income from tax returns
rather than filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 The S&P 500 earnings yield is more than 2 percentage points
above the average interest on debt rated Baa by Moody’s
Investors Service Inc., the most since before 1980, according to
data compiled by MKM.  
 Darda also cited the  steepness  of the yield curve, a proxy
for expected economic growth representing the extra compensation
that Treasury investors demand to hold 30-year bonds instead of
2-year securities. The gap has widened to 3.29 percentage points
from 3.02 points on Sept. 29, suggesting the U.S. economy isn’t
likely to contract, he wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  
 “I still believe that it’s just a soft spot,” said Biggs,
who helps oversee $1.4 billion at New York-based Traxis, in a
telephone interview yesterday. “If we have 3 percent real GDP
growth in the second half, chances are we’re going to get
somewhere between $85 and $90 a share in S&P 500 earnings. It
might be a little less than that. It might be $80, but S&P 500
earnings are going to be fine.”  
 Oil, Technology  
 Biggs said bullish bets make up about 70 percent of his
investments and isn’t selling because he expects the  S&P 500  to
finish the year 10 percent to 15 percent above its level now. He
favors property developers, oil service companies and technology
suppliers in the U.S. and emerging-market equities.  
 Today’s decline left the index’s average price in the last
200 days within 0.7 percent of its 50-day  mean , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Should the lines meet, it would form a so-called
dark cross pattern signaling more losses, Rosenberg said
yesterday. The S&P 500 fell as low as 1,028.33 today, its
weakest level since Oct. 5, 2009.  
 Weakening home sales and the Federal Reserve’s warning that
increasing European debt may harm American growth sent the S&P
500 down 3.7 percent last week, its biggest retreat in more than
a month. The U.S. Commerce Department said June 23 that
purchases of new homes fell in May to a record low as a tax
credit expired.  
 ‘Double-Dip Risks’  
 “Double-dip risks are on the table,” said Rosenberg, who
is advising clients to buy precious metals. It’s “not so much
about valuation. It’s about the outlook for earnings and the
heightened uncertainty over the economy,” he said.  
 Yesterday’s decrease was the biggest since the S&P 500
plummeted 3.4 percent after the Labor Department said 41,000
private-sector jobs were created in May, trailing the 180,000
gain forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. An increase
of 110,000 is projected in a report due July 2, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Alcoa Inc. , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, is
scheduled to begin the second-quarter earnings on July 12, with
analysts calling for profit of 14 cents a share. Overall, Wall
Street firms surveyed by Bloomberg estimate income for S&P 500
companies will rise 34 percent in the period, the third straight
quarter of gains after falling for more than two years.  
 “There’s some real value in this market,” said Ward, who
helps oversee $26 billion at the firm founded by  Mario Gabelli 
in Rye, New York. “If we get a decent payroll number for June,
that puts a different spin on things. Then we start getting
earnings reports, and if the companies are reporting good
numbers and raising guidance it would change the complexion of
this market dramatically and quickly.”
