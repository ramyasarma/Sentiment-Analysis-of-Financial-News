             Sony Corp.  said it’s recalling
535,000 Vaio personal computers because they may overheat due to
a temperature control defect.  
 The recall follows 39 reports of laptops being damaged by
excessive heat and covers F and C series Vaio notebook computers
sold in the U.S., Europe and Asia since January, the company
said in a statement. The cost of the recall won’t be significant,
spokeswoman Noriko Shoji said today by phone without elaborating.  
 The electronics company recalled 9.6 million laptop
batteries in 2006 because overheating cells were a fire risk.
That recall, the biggest in the consumer electronics history,
drained 51.2 billion yen ($578 million) from earnings as the
company met the cost of replacing power cells in laptops made by
customers including Dell Inc., Apple Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd.  
 For the 2006 recall, the company said metal particles that
got into battery cells during the manufacturing process caused
short circuits, leading to overheating. Battery charging units
also played a role in the malfunctions, the company said.  
 Sony fell 1.9 percent to 2,383 yen in Tokyo trading today
before the recall was announced.
