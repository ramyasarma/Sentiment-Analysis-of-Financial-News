             A tunnel in the tomb of Seti I, a
pharaoh who ruled Egypt about 3,300 years ago, has been
discovered after a two-decade-long search in the Valley of the
Kings, Culture Minister  Faruq Hosni  said.  
 Excavations in the tomb, which is one of the most highly
decorated vaults in the ancient necropolis, uncovered a 174-
meter-long (571-feet) tunnel cut into the bedrock, the ministry
said in an e-mailed statement. Archaeologists led by the
country’s  Supreme Council of Antiquities  believe the tunnel may
be the unfinished beginnings of a secret tomb-within-a-tomb.  
 A team led by  Zahi Hawass , secretary-general of the
antiquities council, discovered two descending staircases linked
by passages. The tunnel was painted with preliminary sketches of
decorations as well as painted messages from the architect to
the workmen carving out the tunnel, the ministry cited Hawass as
saying. The entrance was first uncovered in 1960 and later lost,
the ministry said.  
 Discovered in 1817, Seti’s well-preserved tomb is the
longest and deepest of the royal tombs in the Valley of the
Kings, which is also the resting place of the boy-king
Tutankhamun.  
 Located on the west bank of the Nile, the necropolis is a
major attraction for tourists, who are one of Egypt’s main
sources of foreign currency. Tourism, which accounts for 12.6
percent of jobs, brought in $10.76 billion in revenue last year,
according to the ministry.
