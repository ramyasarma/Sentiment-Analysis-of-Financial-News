             Japanese and Australian  stock  futures
fell after Moody’s Investors Service said it may cut Spain’s
credit rating, reviving concern about government debt.  
 American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. , a carmaker
that counts North America as its biggest market, dropped 2.1
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Sharp
Corp., a maker of liquid-crystal displays that gets almost half
of its revenue outside Japan, dropped 1.2 percent as the yen
strengthened. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest
mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil company, lost 2.2
percent from the Sydney close as crude oil prices declined.  
 Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,200 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,355 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,220 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Futures on
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.7 percent today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 0.6 percent in Wellington.  
 “People are afraid that sovereign risks may be translated
into financial institutions’ risks and credit contraction,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees $450 million at Tokyo-based
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “The market is holding a
pessimistic view of the global economy.”  
 In New York, the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 1 percent
yesterday to its lowest since October after the Moody’s report,
snuffing out an earlier rally. Gains were limited after a
private report based on payrolls showed that companies in the
U.S. added fewer workers in June than forecast.  
 Spain’s Rating  
 Spain’s top credit ranking was placed on review for a
possible downgrade by Moody’s as the country prepares to sell as
much 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of five-year notes today.
Moody’s analysts yesterday said “deteriorating” growth
prospects and challenges in meeting fiscal targets mean Spain’s
Aaa classification may be lowered by as much as two grades.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has declined 6.4 percent in
2010, compared with declines of 7.6 percent for the  S&P 500  and
4.2 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.2 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 12.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  
 The Bank of Japan is scheduled to announce its Tankan
survey at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo.  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 88.37 against the dollar
today from 88.55 at yesterday’s close of stock trading in Tokyo.
Against the euro, it strengthened to 108.03 from 108.15. A
stronger yen reduces overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  
 Crude oil for August delivery fell 0.4 percent to $75.63 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since June
14.
