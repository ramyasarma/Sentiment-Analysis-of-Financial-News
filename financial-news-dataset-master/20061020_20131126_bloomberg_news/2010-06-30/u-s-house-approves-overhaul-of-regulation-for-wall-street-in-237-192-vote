             The U.S. House of Representatives
approved a sweeping overhaul of Wall Street regulation, moving
the bill to the brink of passage in Congress.  
 Lawmakers voted 237-192 in favor of the measure, which
would create a consumer financial protection bureau at the
Federal Reserve, a council of regulators to police for risks to
financial system and authority to liquidate large failing firms
whose failure would shake the economy. Senators said they will
hold their vote on the bill next month.
