             German 10-year government bond
yields stayed near the lowest in three weeks before an offering
today from the European Central Bank of three-month loans that
analysts say may determine demand for sovereign debt.  
 Greek 10-year bonds advanced amid speculation central banks
stepped up their asset purchases. Germany plans to auction 6
billion euros ($7.3 billion) of two-year securities. The
country’s Federal Labor Agency said the number of people out of
work fell 21,000 in June, less than the 30,000 predicted in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 “It’s important to see how much liquidity in the short-
term markets change and if we see a reduction in liquidity this
could take out some of the premium priced into bond prices,”
said  Karsten Linowsky , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Suisse AG in Zurich. “We are at such low levels it’s not clear
we will see big demand” at the German auction, he said.  
 The yield on the bund was at 2.56 percent as of 8:46 a.m.
in London, after dropping to 2.53 percent yesterday, the lowest
since June 9. The yield dropped 53 basis points from 3.09
percent on March 31. The 3 percent security maturing in July
2020 fell 0.04, or 40 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to
103.82.  
 The two-year note yield was little changed at 0.54 percent.  
 Euro-region central banks stepped up purchases of Greek,
Portuguese and Irish government securities yesterday, traders
said.  
 Sale Success  
 The purchases focused on maturities of five years and
below, with some buying interest also shown for longer-maturity
Greek bonds, said the traders, who declined to be identified
because the transactions are confidential.  
 Germany’s sale of two-year notes should be a success as an
increase in risk aversion boosts investor demand for the safest
assets, according to ING Groep NV.  
 “Given the backdrop, the auction should not be a problem as
this type of safe paper is exactly what the market is migrating
toward,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market strategy at
ING in Amsterdam, wrote in a client note today.
