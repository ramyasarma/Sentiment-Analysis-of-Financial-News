             Companies in the U.S. added fewer
workers in June than forecast, according to data from a private
report based on payrolls.  
 The 13,000 gain was the smallest since February and
followed a revised 57,000 increase the prior month, figures from
ADP Employer Services showed today. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News had forecast a gain of 60,000, according to the
median estimate.  
 Companies may be slow to add workers until there’s evidence
the gains in demand will be sustained. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey project a Labor Department report in two days will show
payrolls fell this month due to a plunge in government
employment of temporary workers conducting the census.  
 “We’re in a soft patch in the economy and employers are
reluctant to hire,” said  Richard DeKaser , chief economist at
Washington-based Woodley Park Research, whose ADP forecast of
23,000 was closest among economists surveyed. “It suggests non-
government payrolls will be quite soft, well below what’s
necessary to ensure a stable economic recovery.”  
 Projections in the Bloomberg survey of 36 economists ranged
from 23,000 to 100,000 after a previously reported 55,000 gain
in May.  
 Stock-index futures trimmed gains after the report.  Futures 
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in September rose
less than 0.1 percent to 1,035.8 at 8:56 a.m. in New York.  
 Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figures were
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in February, when they overestimated the drop in jobs
by 2,000. The estimate was least accurate in April, when it
underestimated the employment gain by 199,000.  
 Less Reliable  
 “The ADP data appear less reliable when employment trends
are changing, as they are now,”  Aaron Smith , a senior economist
at Moody’s Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said
before the report. “The ADP estimate lagged the deterioration
in jobs in late 2008 and lagged again as employment leveled out
in the second half of last year.”  
 Overall payrolls fell by 115,000 in June, reflecting a drop
in federal census workers as the decennial population count
began to wind down, according to the Bloomberg survey median
ahead of the Labor Department’s July 2 report. Private hiring,
which excludes government jobs, rose for a sixth consecutive
month, economists projected.  
 The Labor Department figures will also show the jobless
 rate  rose to 9.8 percent this month, according to the Bloomberg
survey median. Unemployment is hovering near a 26-year high of
10.1 percent in October.  
 Construction Down  
 Today’s ADP report showed a decrease of 17,000 workers in
goods-producing industries including manufacturers and
construction companies. Employment in construction fell by
35,000, while factories added 16,000 jobs. Service providers
added 30,000 workers.  
 Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 3,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, added 11,000 jobs and small companies decreased
payrolls by 1,000, ADP said.  
 “The recovery in the jobs market is very, very sluggish at
this point,”  Joel Prakken , chairman of St. Louis-based
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, which produces the figures with ADP,
said in a conference call. “There’s really no way to
characterize this number other than disappointing.”  
 While payrolls have increased each month this year, it may
take years to recoup the more than 8 million jobs lost since the
recession began in December 2007, the most of any downturn in
the post-World War II era.  
 Fed’s View  
 Federal Reserve policy makers this month said the labor
market was “improving gradually,” and reiterated a pledge to
keep the benchmark interest at a record low for an “extended
period” to help nurture the recovery.  
 Manufacturers expanding employment include  Toyota Motor
Corp. , the world’s largest automaker. Toyota said on June 17 it
will complete a plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi, and hire
2,000 workers to begin production of Corollas by the end of next
year. The company had mothballed the project 18 months ago as
U.S. sales collapsed.  
 The ADP report is based on data from about 500,000
businesses with more than 21 million workers on payrolls. ADP
began keeping records in January 2001 and started publishing its
numbers in 2006.
