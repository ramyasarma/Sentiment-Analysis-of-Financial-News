             Investors should “selectively” add
to holdings of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong in the third
quarter as  share  prices are already pricing in slowing growth
and as the government eases its tightening policies, Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc said.  
 The brokerage upgraded insurance and cement stocks to
“overweight” and raised its ratings on bank and property
shares to “neutral,” analysts led by  Wendy Liu  wrote in a June
29 report.  
 “In the third quarter, we should see year-on-year macro
growth data declining initially before stabilizing toward the
end of the period,” the analysts said. “Policy may relax after
weak second-quarter macro data and an uncertain second-half
export outlook, setting up good support for a rebound in the
third quarter.”  
 The MSCI China Index , tracking mostly Hong Kong-traded
Chinese shares, has dropped 8 percent this year.
