             Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-
largest mining company, and  Korea Zinc Co.  fell after
commodities slumped the most in 10 months on economic concerns
in the U.S. and China.  
 Rio dropped 3.3 percent to A$66.17 at 12:10 p.m. local time
on the Australian stock exchange. Korea Zinc, the world’s
second-biggest zinc smelter, dropped 3.5 percent at 10:57 a.m.
Seoul time. China’s Yunnan Copper Industry Co. declined 5.7
percent in Shenzhen trading at 10:11 a.m.  
 Stocks  from Shanghai to New York tumbled and two-year
Treasury yields slid to a record low on concern over weakening
growth in China and a slump in U.S. consumer confidence. The
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials tumbled 2.8
percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 14.  
 “Markets are worried about the bigger picture, about the
U.S., China and Europe, with the bigger concern that the U.S. is
showing signs of a double-dip recession,” said  Ben Potter , a
Melbourne-based analyst, at IG Markets Ltd.  
 The Conference Board said yesterday its leading economic
index for China, the biggest consumer of raw materials, rose 0.3
percent in April, less than the 1.7 percent reported June 15.
The same research group’s gauge of U.S. consumer confidence
slumped to 52.9 in June, below all 71 projections in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  
 “This will cap household spending, and thus economic
recovery,” Potter said.  
 Copper, aluminum and zinc on the London Metal Exchange are
heading for a quarterly slump on concerns about the strength of
the global economy. Copper futures in Shanghai fell 2.4 percent
at 10:03 a.m. local time.  
 “We are maintaining our bearish outlook for the industrial
metals complex and specifically copper and nickel,” said
Deutsche Bank AG analyst  Michael Lewis  in a June 29 report. “We
believe the sector remains vulnerable to a slowdown in Chinese
fixed asset investment growth.”  
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company,
dropped 2.3 percent to A$37.22 at 12:04 p.m. Sydney time, and
 Fortescue Metals Group Ltd . slid 5.3 percent.  Posco , South
Korea’s largest steelmaker, fell 2.4 percent in Seoul trading,
and Nippon Steel Corp., Japan’s biggest mill, declined 2.3
percent to 296 yen at 11 a.m. trading break on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
