             Three Czech parties that pledged to
curb spending said they agreed on the makeup of a cabinet as
they continue work on a governing accord, including cuts to next
year’s state  budget .  
 The cabinet of  Petr Necas , named as prime minister by
President  Vaclav Klaus  on June 28, matches the smallest in the
country’s history with 15 members, Necas’ Civic Democratic Party
said in a statement in Prague today.  
 The government, which will also include the Public Affairs
party, will have 118 mandates in the 200-seat parliament, the
strongest majority since the Czech Republic became an
independent state in 1993.  
 The parties pledged to restore fiscal prudence after the
budget deficit widened to 5.9 percent of gross domestic product
last year, almost double the European Union’s 3 percent limit.
Necas said on June 11 that the limit for next year’s public
finance shortfall will be 4.8 percent.  
 Miroslav Kalousek  of TOP09 will return to the post of
finance minister, which he held in the Civic Democrat coalition
administration that collapsed after losing a confidence vote in
March 2009.  Karel Schwarzenberg , also of TOP09, will return to
the post of foreign minister, which he held in the Civic
Democrat-led cabinet.  
 The three parties, negotiating on a program since May 28-29
elections, have said they want to have a cabinet in place by
mid-July so that they can shape next year’s state  budget.
