             U.S. Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar 
said the Obama administration supports higher civil and criminal
penalties for violations of offshore oil and gas drilling rules,
and he defended a moratorium on undersea exploration.  
 Higher penalties are consistent with U.S. efforts to change
the law governing exploration on the outer continental shelf,
Salazar said today in testimony prepared for the House Natural
Resources Committee.  
 President  Barack Obama  halted drilling for six months in
waters deeper than 500 feet on May 27 to give a commission time
to study safety improvements for offshore operations after a BP
Plc well spewed oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The ban was tossed
out by U.S. District Judge  Martin Feldman  in a June 22 ruling.  
 “We are taking responsible action to address the safety of
other offshore oil and gas operations, further tightening our
oversight of industry’s practices through a package of
reforms,” Salazar said in the written remarks without saying
how the moratorium would be changed to resolve the judge’s
objections.  
 Representative  George Miller , chairman of the House
Education and Labor Committee, citing previous BP pipeline and
refinery accidents, questioned whether BP’s safety record
warrants barring it from underwater drilling for five to seven
years. Such a move would have little impact on the supply of
fossil fuels in the U.S., he said.  
 “Are they going to be allowed to go back out to a very
dangerous place for the environment?” said Miller, a California
Democrat. “I’m concerned about the ethics of this company and
how they have performed.”
