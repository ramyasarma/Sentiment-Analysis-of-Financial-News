             Roger Federer, the defending
champion and No. 1 seed, was upset by Tomas Berdych in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon today, failing to reach the final for
the first time since 2002.  
 Berdych of the Czech Republic, who was also a semifinalist
at the French Open this year, beat the Swiss 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4
on Centre Court.  
 Federer had been seeking to tie Pete Sampras’s Open era
men’s record of seven titles at the All England Club.
