             Gold prices may extend this year’s
advance and climb to a record $1,385 an ounce, according to
technical analysis by Barclays Capital.  
 Barclays maintains its “bullish bias” for gold after the
precious metal rose above the 21-day moving average. The
attached chart shows gold may rise another 12 percent, according
to bullion’s trend channel, which connects highs and lows.  
 “We maintain our bullish bias for a move through the bull-
market highs,” Barclays analysts including  MacNeil Curry  in New
York wrote in a report on June 28. “We look for a push towards
$1,385, 20-month channel resistance, as speculators begin to
rebuild their long positions.”  
 Hedge funds and other large speculators last week increased
their net-long positions, or bets on higher New York gold
futures prices, to the highest since December, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures. The futures rose
to a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 Gold has climbed 13 percent this year as investors sought
to protect their savings from declines in the value of the euro
because of debts in Europe. The SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, has attracted investors
including John Paulson and George Soros.  
 The metal for immediate delivery traded at $1,241.82 an
ounce at 7:14 a.m. in London.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A moving average shows a
commodity’s average value over a specified time period.
