             South African  credit increased for
the first time in eight months in May as lower interest rates
spurred consumer spending, strengthening the economy’s recovery.  
 Borrowing  by households and businesses rose an annual 0.8
percent after dropping 0.9 percent in April, the Reserve Bank
said on its website today. The  median estimate  of 13 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a gain of 0.6 percent.  
 The Reserve Bank cut its benchmark interest  rate  seven
times to 6.5 percent since December 2008, helping to curtail the
first recession in 17 years. Consumer spending, which makes up
two-thirds of demand in the economy, has been slow to rebound as
the  unemployment rate  climbed to 25.2 percent, the highest of 62
countries tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “We still have a fairly anemic retail environment and
underlying inflationary pressure is weak,” said  Russell Lamberti , an economist at Econometrix Treasury Management in
Johannesburg. “Interest rates will at the very least stay on
hold, and one can’t rule out a rate cut.”  
 The rand was at 7.6611 against the dollar as of 9:40 a.m.
in Johannesburg from 7.6592 before the data was released. The
yield on the R157 government bond, due 2015, fell 1 basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.09 percent.  
 The Reserve Bank, which has lowered its key rate by 5.5
percentage points, will make its next interest rate decision on
July 22.  
 The broad  M3  measure of money supply rose an annual 1.4
percent in May, after gaining 1.7 percent in the previous month,
the central bank said.
