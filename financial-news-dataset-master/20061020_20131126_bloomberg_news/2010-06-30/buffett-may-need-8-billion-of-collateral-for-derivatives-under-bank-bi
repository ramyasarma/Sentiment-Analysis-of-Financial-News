             Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the company
run by billionaire  Warren Buffett,  may have to set aside $8
billion in collateral for derivatives under proposed changes to
U.S. financial regulations, a Barclays Capital analyst said.  
 Berkshire owns derivatives with a notional value of about
$62 billion and has “negligible” collateral requirements,
Barclays analyst  Jay Gelb  said today in a report. Buffett’s
firm, based in Omaha, Nebraska, may need to post $6 billion to
$8 billion in collateral under rules being debated by the U.S.
Congress, he said.  
 David Sokol , chairman of Berkshire’s energy business and
one of Buffett’s top managers, told CNBC in April that $6
billion to $10 billion may be needed. Buffett, 79, said in May
that Berkshire may not be affected by the rules because
lawmakers are likely to focus only on weaker companies.  
 The U.S. House of Representatives is debating the
financial-overhaul bill in advance of a final vote, moving
closer to enacting the biggest rewrite of Wall Street rules
since the Great Depression. Among the provisions that may become
law is a requirement for corporations to post collateral for
certain derivatives contracts, according to the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association.
