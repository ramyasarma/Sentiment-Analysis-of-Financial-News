             Elad Canada Inc.  plans to start the
process for an initial public offering in Tel Aviv if global
markets recover,  Globes  reported, citing an interview with Elad
Group Chief Executive Officer  Miki Naftali .  
 The company plans to receive all the necessary approvals in
four weeks, assuming there are no new market disruptions,
Naftali told the newspaper.  
 The property company, owned by Israeli billionaire  Isaac Tshuva , delayed a sale planned for May as global markets plunged
on concern that Greece and other nations in Europe may not be
able to meet their debt payments.
