             UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest
lender, sued Highland Capital Management LP, claiming losses of
at least $686 million over a failed collateralized debt
obligation transaction.  
 Highland Capital, the investment firm founded by  James Dondero  and  Mark Okada , and two affiliates “fraudulently
induced” UBS to restructure the CDO in 2008, the Zurich-based
bank alleged in papers filed in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan.  
 The new lawsuit follows a complaint filed by UBS on Feb.
24, 2009. Highland Capital won dismissal in February of this
year of one of three claims in the 2009 lawsuit. UBS separately
filed an amended complaint in that case on June 28, court
records show.  
 An appeals court in Manhattan reversed an October ruling by
New York State Supreme Court Justice  Bernard Fried , who had
refused to dismiss a claim that Highland Capital had a duty to
indemnify UBS for losses incurred when the transaction failed to
occur before the agreements terminated.  
 “We are disappointed that UBS has chosen to refile its
baseless lawsuit against Highland Capital and the funds given
the court’s previous dismissal of the suit’s central claim,”
 Nina Devlin , an outside spokeswoman for Highland Capital with
Edelman in New York, said in an e-mailed statement.  
 CDOs are securities backed by corporate loans, mortgages,
auto loans, credit cards and other assets that are sliced into
layers carrying different levels of risk.  
 The case is UBS Securities LLC v. Highland Capital
Management LP, 650752/2010, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).
