             German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
candidate, Christian Wulff, failed to win enough votes to secure
the German presidency in a first round of voting in Berlin
today.  
 Wulff won 600 votes in the 1,244-member assembly, while the
opposition candidate, Joachim Gauck, got 499 votes. A third
candidate, Luc Jochimsen, won 126 votes.  
 Voting will now go to a second round, also to be held
today. A total of 623 votes is needed to win in the second
round. If voting goes into a third round, the candidate with the
most votes wins.
