             Rafael Nadal, the 2008 Wimbledon
champion, won the second set of his quarterfinal at the All
England Club 6-3 against Sweden’s Robin Soderling to tie the
match at 1-1.  
 The Spaniard, who missed Wimbledon last year with a knee
injury, is the top-ranked player on the ATP Tour, but is seeded
No. 2 at Wimbledon. The Sixth-ranked Soderling took the first
set 6-3.  
 Nadal claimed his seventh Grand Slam title earlier this
month at the French Open, beating Soderling in the final.
