             Bank of Baroda , the state-owned
Indian lender, sold 5 billion rupees ($107 million) of 15-year
bonds to boost its capital, according to three people familiar

 The Mumbai-based borrower agreed to pay an 8.48 percent
coupon for the first 10 years, rising to 8.98 percent if it
doesn’t redeem the notes in 2020, one of the people said, asking
