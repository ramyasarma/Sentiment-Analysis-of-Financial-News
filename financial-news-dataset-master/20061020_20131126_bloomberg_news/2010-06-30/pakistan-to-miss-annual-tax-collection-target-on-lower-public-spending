             Pakistan may miss its annual tax
collection target for the fiscal year ended today after the
government spent less than half the money allocated for public
spending on infrastructure projects.  
 Collection is likely to be about 1.34 trillion rupees
($15.6 billion), compared with a target of 1.38 trillion, Sohail
Ahmed, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue, said at a news
conference in Islamabad today.  
 “The target was based on public sector spending of 450
billion rupees and the government reduced this to 215 billion,”
Ahmed said.  
 The government’s budget deficit may be as much as 5.6
percent of gross domestic product because of low tax collection,
according to the central bank.  
 South Asia’s second biggest economy after India plans to
increase tax collection in the year starting tomorrow to narrow
the fiscal gap to 4 percent of GDP, the lowest in six years. The
government plans to collect 1.67 trillion rupees in the next
financial year.  
 It collected 1.18 trillion rupees in the year ended June
30, 2009, missing its target of 1.25 trillion rupees.
