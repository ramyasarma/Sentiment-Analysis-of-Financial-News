             Amplifon SpA  was rated “buy” at
Jefferies, which initiated coverage of the world’s largest
hearing-aid distributor and set a price estimate of 4.7 euros.  
 “We expect the hearing aid market to exhibit the highest
top-line growth in the sector over the next five years,” the
brokerage said in a note today. “Amplifon’s low valuation and
high operating leverage puts it in the pole position to benefit
from the positive dynamics.”
