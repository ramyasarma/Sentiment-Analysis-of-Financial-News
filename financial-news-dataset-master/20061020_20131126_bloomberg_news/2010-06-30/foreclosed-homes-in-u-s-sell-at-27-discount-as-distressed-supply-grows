             Homes in the foreclosure process
sold at an average 27 percent discount in the first quarter as
almost a third of all U.S. transactions involved properties in
some stage of  mortgage distress , according to  RealtyTrac Inc.   
 A total of 232,959 homes sold in the period had received a
default or auction notice or were seized by banks, RealtyTrac
said in a report today. That’s down 14 percent from the fourth
quarter and 33 percent from the peak a year earlier, the company
said. The average price of a distressed property was $171,971,
according to the Irvine, California-based data seller.  
 “The discount will probably stay between 25 percent and 30
percent as lenders carefully manage the number of new
foreclosure actions in order to avoid flooding the market,”
 Rick Sharga , RealtyTrac’s senior vice president for marketing,
said in an interview.  
 “We’re clearly creating more properties that will be sold
at distressed prices than the market is absorbing,” Sharga
said. There were more than 250,000 new bank seizures in the
first quarter.  
 The discount reflects the average sales price of homes in
the foreclosure process compared with the average sales price of
properties not in distress. About 31 percent of all U.S. sales
in the quarter were of homes in some stage of foreclosure,
RealtyTrac said.  
 Rising Seizures  
 Home  foreclosures  set a record for the second straight
month in May, with increases in every state, as lenders stepped
up property seizures, RealtyTrac said earlier this month. Bank
repossessions climbed 44 percent from a year earlier and will
probably set a record in the second quarter, the company said.  
 Distressed sales totaled more than 1.2 million last year, a
25 percent increase from 2008 and a more than four-fold rise
from 2007, according to RealtyTrac.  
 Such transactions accounted for 29 percent of all sales
last year, up from 23 percent in 2008 and 6 percent in 2007. The
average foreclosure discount was 25 percent in 2009, 22 percent
in 2008 and 26 percent in 2007.  
 A “normal” market would show foreclosures accounting for
less than 2 percent of sales, Sharga said.  
 Bank-owned properties  sold for an average 34 percent
discount in the first quarter, up from 32 percent both in the
previous quarter and a year earlier. Such properties accounted
for 19 percent of all U.S. home sales, up from almost 16 percent
in the fourth quarter and down from 21 percent in the first
quarter of 2009, RealtyTrac data show.  
 Short Sales  
 Properties in default or scheduled for auction sold for an
average discount of almost 15 percent, up from almost 14 percent
in the previous quarter and down from 16 percent a year earlier.
These homes are often sold in short sales, where lenders accept
less than the outstanding loan amount for the property,
RealtyTrac said. Sales of properties either in default or headed
for auction accounted for 12 percent of all sales.  
 The average price was $154,740 for bank-owned properties
and $199,950 for homes in default or scheduled for auction,
RealtyTrac said.  
 “The competing forces will be bank-owned properties and
short sales,” Sharga said. “The more short sales, the lower
the average discount is likely to be.”  
 Nevada  had the highest proportion of distressed sales of
any U.S. state, with 64 percent of all transactions involving
properties in mortgage distress.  
 California ranked second, with such sales accounting for 51
percent of all sales and  Arizona  was third at 50 percent.  
 Discounts on distressed homes were highest in Ohio,
Kentucky and  Illinois , where they sold for an average of at
least 39 percent less than non-foreclosures.  
 RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the U.S. population.
