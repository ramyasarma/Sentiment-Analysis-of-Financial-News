             More than half of U.S. workers were
either unemployed or experienced reductions in hours or wages
since the recession began in December 2007, according to a
private  report .  
 The worst economic slump since the 1930s has affected 55
percent of adults in the labor force, the Washington-based Pew
Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, said today. The
survey found that 32 percent of employees were jobless at some
point during the past 30 months.  
 The pace of hiring suggests it will take years for the
world’s largest economy to recover the more than 8 million jobs
lost during the contraction. A slow rebound in employment
stifles consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the economy.  
 “A unique feature of the Great Recession is that, for the
first time, the majority of the unemployed workers had lost
their jobs for good,” Pew said in the report. “Households have
adopted a more fiscally conservative path since the recession
started.”  
 The majority of Americans, or 54 percent, say the economy
is still in recession, while 41 percent say it is beginning to
recover, the study showed. The National Bureau of Economic
Research, which is responsible for determining U.S. business
cycles, has not declared an end to the recession.  
 The survey of 2,967 adults was conducted by telephone from
May 11 through May 31. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.2
percentage points, Pew said.
