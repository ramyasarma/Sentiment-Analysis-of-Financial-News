             The cost to protect bank bonds from
default fell the most in more than a week after the European
Central Bank said lenders asked for 131.9 billion euros ($162
billion) for three months, less than economists had forecast.  
 Credit-default swaps on the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
of 25 banks and insurers declined 6.5 basis points to 165.5,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London, the biggest one-day
decline since June 18.  
 Banks tomorrow need to repay 442 billion euros in 12-month
ECB funds and demand for the three-month cash was a litmus test
for the health of Europe’s banking system, economists said. The
Frankfurt-based central bank said 171 institutions asked for
money at its benchmark interest rate of 1 percent.  
 “The initial reaction should be a stop of all risk-
aversion related trades,” said  Luca Cazzulani , senior fixed-
income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan.  
 U.S. index futures rose as equity markets rebounded from
the biggest sell-off in 14 months. The euro strengthened and
European stocks rallied after the central bank figures suggested
reduced funding pressure for lenders.  
 Credit-default swaps tied to Greek bonds fell 72.75 basis
points to 930.25, the fourth-straight drop, while contracts on
Portugal declined 15.5 basis points to 315.25, according to CMA
DataVision. Swaps on Spain tightened 6 to 265.5 basis points.  
 “The figure is probably lower than the market was
expecting and therefore will be taken as good news,”  Gary Jenkins , the head of credit strategy at Evolutions Securities
Ltd. in London, wrote in a note to investors.  
 The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 50 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 4 basis points to
582.5, according to Markit Group Ltd. The Markit iTraxx Europe
index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings declined 3
basis point to 130.5, Markit prices show.  
 Equities, Bunds Rise  
 The euro, equities and bund rates will rise, while yields
on southern European bonds should decline relative to benchmark
rates, Cazzulani forecasts. When the 442 billion euros of debt
is repaid there will be very little excess liquidity left in the
system, pushing money-market rates higher, he said.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. The index is a
benchmark for the cost of protecting bonds against default and
an increase signals a deterioration in the perception of credit
quality.
