             India’s government  bonds  rose,
completing their first quarterly gain since 2008, on optimism
revenue from selling licenses to provide telecommunication
services will help cut the  fiscal deficit  from a 16-year high.  
 Fuel prices were freed from state control last week, which
may lead to lower subsidy expenditure. The companies that won
permits for third-generation mobile phone operations paid 677.2
billion rupees ($14.6 billion) last month, almost double the 350
billion rupees estimated in the  budget.  Wireless broadband
operators paid a combined 385.4 billion rupees this month.  
 “The 3G bonanza and measures to reduce petrol and diesel
subsidies will ultimately lead to a reduction in the fiscal
deficit,” said S. Srikumar, a fixed-income trader at
Corporation Bank in Mumbai. “On the whole, I’m bullish on
bonds.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped two
basis points today to 7.55 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price rose 0.14, or 14 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to
101.70. The yield fell 28 basis points in the three months
ending June 30, as the  10-year bond  snapped five straight
quarters of losses.  
 The funds raised from selling third generation licenses
will help reduce fiscal deficit, Kaushik Basu, chief economic
adviser in the finance ministry said yesterday.  
 The government plans to reduce the deficit to 5.5 percent
of gross domestic product in the fiscal year that began April
from 6.9 percent last year.  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, was 5.48 percent, compared with 5.52 percent yesterday.
