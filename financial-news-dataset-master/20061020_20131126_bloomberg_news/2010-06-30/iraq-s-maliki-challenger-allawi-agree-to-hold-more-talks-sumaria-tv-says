             Iraq’s Prime Minister  Nuri al-Maliki 
and his main electoral challenger  Ayad Allawi  met for more than
two hours late yesterday and agreed to hold more talks as the
country seeks a new government almost four months after
elections, al-Sumaria Television said.  
 The two frontrunners in the March 7 parliamentary election
held their second meeting since the vote at Allawi’s Baghdad
office, Beirut-based al-Sumaria  reported . Senior politicians
from both al-Maliki’s State of Law Alliance and Allawi’s
Iraqiyah bloc also attended, the channel said.  
 Both Allawi, who was backed by mainly Sunni Muslim voters
and al-Maliki, leader of a Shiite Muslim alliance, claim the
right to form the new government as leader of the largest bloc
in the 325 seat parliament. Neither has secured the backing of
enough lawmakers to command a majority.  
 Talks to form a new Iraqi government are proceeding as the
U.S. prepares to cut troop levels in Iraq from about 86,000 to
50,000 by September, before a full withdrawal next year.
