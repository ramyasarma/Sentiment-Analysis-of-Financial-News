             Russian corporate lending grew at
the fastest pace this year in May as the economic recovery
gained momentum, central bank data show.  
 Corporate loans rose 1.9 percent, compared with 0.9 percent
in the previous month, Bank Rossii said in a report on its
website today. Retail loans advanced 1.2 percent in May,
compared with 1 percent the month before, it said. Retail
deposits increased 1.7 percent, according to the report.  
 Improved global demand for  commodities  jump-started
Russia’s economic recovery last year, while higher wages and
lower savings boosted domestic consumption this year, Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin said yesterday.  
 The  economy  may expand 4 percent this year after last
year’s record 7.9 percent contraction, he said. Bank Rossii
First Deputy Chairman Alexei Ulyukayev estimated growth is set
to reach “at least” 5 percent this year.
