             Traders are wrong to suspect that
the price-graph pattern known as a death cross would lead to a
rout in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , according to Brockhouse
& Cooper Inc.  
 The  S&P 500 ’s 50-day average dropped to 1,122.48 yesterday,
compared with the 200-day mean of 1,112.22. Death crosses happen
when the first number drops below the second. Since 1970, death
crosses in the stock index preceded an average decline of 0.4
percent in the next month and three- and six-month gains of 2.5
percent and 4.8 percent, respectively, according to the
Montreal-based brokerage. Eleven of the 21 occurrences preceded
a one-month rally, the firm found.  
 “The technical analysis world is abuzz again,”  Pierre Lapointe , Brockhouse & Cooper’s global strategist, wrote in a
report today. Technical analysts use patterns in price charts to
make investment decisions. “But the truth of the matter is that
death crosses have little predictive value,” he added.  
 The benchmark index for U.S. stocks dropped 7.7 percent in
the six months following the last death cross, on Dec. 19, 2007,
Brockhouse & Cooper said. After the one before that, on July 14,
2006, the S&P 500 posed a six-month rally of 15 percent, the
data show. The biggest six-month gain was the 31 percent rally
after April 21, 1980, and the largest drop was the 18 percent
slump following May 17, 2002. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  formed a
death cross on June 25 and has fallen 2.6 percent since then.
