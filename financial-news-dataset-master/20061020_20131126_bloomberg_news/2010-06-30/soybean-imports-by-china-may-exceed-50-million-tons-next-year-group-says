             Soybean imports by China, the
biggest buyer, may gain at least 6 percent next year, driven by
rising wealth as rural inhabitants move into cities, figures
from a U.S. industry group showed.  
 Imports of “50 million might even be conservative,”
Phillip Laney, the China country director for the U.S. Soybean
Export Council, said yesterday in an interview at a conference
in Ho Chi Minh City. “It isn’t going to be 60 million,” but
it could be 51 million tons or 52 million tons, he said.  
 China’s imports account for more than half of global
exports and are forecast at 47 million tons this year by the
U.S. Foreign Agricultural Service, almost double the 25.8
million-ton level in 2004-2005. Increased Chinese buying may
support prices that have fallen about 13 percent this year on
expectations of record global oilseed harvests.  
 “The country’s soybean consumption is likely to continue
to rise by 7 to 9 percent a year with the pace of
urbanization,” Dong Shuzhi, assistant general manager at
Jinshi Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  
 About half of Chinese now live in urban areas, up from
about a fifth in the early 1980s, as the country’s export
industries seek workers for factories, Laney said.  
 More Protein  
 Urban inhabitants “have a better income and eat better,”
he said. Their diet has more meat and protein based on the
raising of animals using soybeans in feed, he said.  
 The U.S. is the biggest supplier of soybeans to China,
with a 45 percent market share in the 2008-2009 marketing year,
followed by Brazil with 39 percent and Argentina’s 14 percent,
according to a  February report  from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  
 Laney’s estimate was for the marketing year beginning Sept.
1, 2010. China’s soybean imports in the first five months of
the calendar year have gained 13 percent to 19.6 million tons,
according to customs data. Soybeans for November delivery
gained 0.2 percent to $9.135 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade at 1:12 p.m. in Shanghai.  
 Soybeans were the top U.S. export to China in 2009, with
the value of shipments jumping 26 percent to $9.21 billion,
according to  figures  from the U.S. International Trade
Commission. Shipments through April this year have climbed 14
percent to $3.3 billion.  
 “What else do we sell to China that’s anywhere near this
magnitude?” said Laney. “Not  Boeing  airplanes at $250 million
apiece.”
