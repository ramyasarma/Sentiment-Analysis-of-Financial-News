             Sundaram Finance Ltd.  agreed to buy
the 49.9 percent stake it doesn’t already own in an Indian asset
management unit from foreign partner BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co.  
 The board of Sundaram Finance decided to acquire BNP’s
stake in Sundaram BNP Paribas Asset Management Co. and Sundaram
BNP Paribas Trustee Co., the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The two companies will become fully owned units
of Sundaram Finance after the acquisition, it said.  
 Sundaram Finance, a south India-based finance company, did
not disclose the amount it is paying for the purchase.  
 The company’s shares rose 2.3 percent to 458.20 rupees as
of 2:37 p.m. local time in Mumbai.   
 Last year, BNP Paribas acquired some of Fortis Bank’s
international operations, including the asset management unit in
India. The French bank’s mutual fund venture with India’s
Sundaram Finance manages assets worth $3 billion. Fortis’s asset
management company in the nation has assets worth $1.6 billion.  
 BNP Paribas SA , France’s biggest bank, said in March it was
reviewing operations in India following reports that the
regulator asked the company to resolve how it will manage the
stakes it owns in two mutual fund managers in the country. India
bans companies from owning stakes simultaneously in two rival
asset managers.
