             The U.K.’s 50 percent tax on incomes
above 150,000 pounds ($224,325) is denting the appeal of London
and Britain as a place to do business, according to a majority
of respondents in a Confederation of British Industry survey.  
 Fifty-seven percent of company executives questioned said
the income tax rate is having an impact on companies choosing
London as a base or deciding whether to stay in the U.K., the
CBI said in a semi-annual report on business attitudes in the
city released today.  
 Former Prime Minister  Gordon Brown  earlier this year raised
the rate for higher earners from 40 percent to reduce Britain’s
record budget deficit. The U.K.’s current coalition government
added to those measures last month when it announced the deepest
spending cuts in a generation and raised the sales-tax rate.  
 The survey also showed that 53 percent of participants were
“optimistic” or “very optimistic” for their prospects in the
next six months, compared with 47 percent of respondents in the
CBI’s last report in December, the lobby group said.
