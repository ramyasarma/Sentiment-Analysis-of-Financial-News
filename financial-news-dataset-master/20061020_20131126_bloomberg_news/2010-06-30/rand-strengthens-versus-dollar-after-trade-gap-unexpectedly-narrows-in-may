             The rand strengthened for a second
day this week after a report showed South Africa’s trade deficit
unexpectedly narrowed last month because of a surge in exports,
reducing the need for foreign capital inflows to fund the gap.  
 The currency appreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 7.6092
per dollar before trading 0.3 percent stronger at 7.6444 by 4:17
p.m. in Johannesburg, from a close of 7.6652 yesterday. Against
the euro, the rand lost 0.3 percent to 9.3870.  
 Africa’s biggest economy posted a  trade shortfall  of 302
million rand ($39.6 million) in May, following a 1.9 billion-
rand deficit in April, according to a government report. That’s
less than the 2.5 billion rand gap from the median estimate of
12 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. Exports rose 6.8 percent,
outpacing a 5 percent increase in imports.  
 The “trade balance has surprised the market,”  Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in
Johannesburg, wrote in a client note. “We view today’s result
as rand-positive.”  
 A lower-than-expected trade deficit may slow an expected
widening of the gap on South Africa’s  current account , the
broadest measure of trade in goods and services. The current-
account shortfall is expected to reach 4.9 percent of gross
domestic product this year and 5.3 percent in 2011, the National
Treasury said on Feb. 17.  
 South Africa relies on foreign purchases of its stocks and
bonds to offset the shortfall and prevent the rand from
weakening. Foreign investors have purchased a net 58.2 billion
rand of South African assets this year, according to data from
the JSE Ltd., which runs the nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  
 Bonds Gain  
 Government bonds rose in South Africa, with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 gaining 30 cents to
122.80 rand. The yield on the bond fell 7 basis points to 8.03
percent.  
 Investors increased bets that South Africa’s central bank
may lower its 6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next
meets on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of
 three-month contracts  for cash in three months retreated 1.75
basis points from the previous close to 6.4175 percent. The rate
reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.
