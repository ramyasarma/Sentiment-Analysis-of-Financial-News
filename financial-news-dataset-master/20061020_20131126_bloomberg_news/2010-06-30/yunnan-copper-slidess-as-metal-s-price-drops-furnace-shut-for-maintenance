             Yunann Copper Industry Co. ,
controlled by Aluminum Corp. of China, fell to the lowest level
in 15 months in Shenzhen trading as the metal price declined and
it announced plans to shut a furnace for maintenance.  
 The shares dropped as much as 8.9 percent to 17.30 yuan,
the lowest price since March 2009, and traded at 17.95 yuan at
11:29 a.m. local time. China’s fourth-biggest copper producer
said yesterday it will shut a smelter for repair from tomorrow
to April 1, 2011.  
 Copper, aluminum and other metals are heading for a
quarterly price slump on concerns about the strength of the
global economy. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials tumbled 2.8 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 14,
on concern over weakening growth in China and a slump in U.S.
consumer confidence.  
 “The volatility in metal prices will impact companies’
production and operations,” Zhang Wantong, a spokesman of
Kunming-based Yunnan Copper, said by phone today. “But copper
is a common industrial product, and consumption patterns are
less likely to be affected by the volatility.”  
 Copper futures fell 2 percent to 51,720 yuan ($7,614) a
metric ton in Shanghai at 11:30 a.m. local time.  
 “The copper furnace hasn’t been maintained since it was
bought in 1998 and it needed a big overhaul,” Zhang said. The
plant turns concentrates into refined copper and has an annual
capacity of 200,000 tons, he said.  
 Production for 2010 won’t be affected, the company said
yesterday in its statement. Yunnan Copper will turn more blister
and copper anodes into refined copper to compensate for the
shortfall from smelting concentrates in the furnace, Zhang said.  
 The company has a 2010 production target of 320,000 tons,
according to its annual report. Output of refined copper dropped
25 percent to 289,000 tons in 2009.
