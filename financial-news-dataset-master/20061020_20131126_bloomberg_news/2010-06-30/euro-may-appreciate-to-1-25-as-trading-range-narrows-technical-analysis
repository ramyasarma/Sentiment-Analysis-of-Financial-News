             The euro may rise to $1.25 as its
trading range narrows, pushing the currency above its two-month
declining trend while a support level limits losses, according
to a Citigroup Inc. report.  
 The 16-nation currency fell 13 percent from $1.3667 on
April 15 to a four-year low of $1.1877 on June 7, before
rebounding to $1.2398 on June 28 and crossing above support that
Citigroup identified at $1.2154. The level held as a two-day
slump pushed the euro down 1.5 percent to a close of $1.2188
yesterday. Support is an area on a chart where orders to buy may
block a decline.  
 “Euro-dollar held the support level at $1.2154 yesterday
and has since stabilized overnight,” Citigroup technical
analysts led by  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New York wrote in a note to
clients. “Trend resistance comes in at $1.2363, and a rally
through there would suggest a test of $1.2490-$1.2510.”  
 The euro rose as much as 1 percent to $1.2304 today, its
biggest gain in two weeks, and traded at $1.2266 as of 1:27 p.m.
in New York. It also appreciated against 14 of its 16 major
counterparts from the pound to the yen to the Swedish krona.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
