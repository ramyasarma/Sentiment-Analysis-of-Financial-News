             European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the EU isn’t seeking to
weaken the competitiveness of national economies in its
proposals for a wider range of sanctions for excessive deficits.  
 “The intention is that the excessive imbalances position
would lead to recommendations in the council and any country
should respect the recommendations,” Rehn told reporters in
Brussels today. “Nobody is wanting to weaken any country’s
export performance.”
