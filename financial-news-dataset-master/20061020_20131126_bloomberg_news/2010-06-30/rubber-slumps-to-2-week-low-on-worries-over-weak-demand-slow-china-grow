             Rubber had the first quarterly loss
since 2008 on concern the global economic recovery may falter,
weakening demand for the commodity used in tires.  
 Futures in Tokyo tumbled for a third day to the lowest
level in more than two weeks, after data showed an unexpected
drop in U.S. consumer confidence and the downward revision of a
leading economic indicator for China. The price dropped 13
percent this quarter, the first loss since the three months
ended Dec. 31, 2008.  
 Asian stocks  extended a global rout, dropping to a three-
week low. The Conference Board’s gauge of confidence among U.S.
consumers slumped to 52.9 this month from a revised 62.7 in May.
The nation is the biggest consumer of natural rubber after China.  
 “The market came under pressure amid concern that the
global economy may slow down as governments, struggling to
reduce fiscal deficits, cannot continue stimulus measures,”
 Hisaaki Tasaka , analyst at Tokyo-based broker ACE Koeki Co.,
said today by phone. “Rubber may drop further together with
other industrial commodities.”  
 December-delivery rubber fell as much as 2.9 percent to
266.5 yen ($3,011 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
before settling at 269.2 yen.  
 The Conference Board said yesterday its leading economic
index for China climbed more slowly in April than previously
estimated. The board’s U.S. confidence index in June was lower
than all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Thai Output  
 Rubber futures advanced yesterday to 285.2 yen, the highest
level since May 28, as rain disrupted output in Thailand, the
biggest producer and exporter.  
 “The downside is limited as Japan and China have low
inventories,” said  Felix Yeo , trading manager at the Singapore
unit of Marubeni Corp. “Raw materials are still tight and that
will easily push up the market again.”  
 Stockpiles in China declined to the lowest level in seven
years, data showed last week, sparking optimism that the world’s
biggest buyer may soon replenish inventories.  
 Natural rubber  stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 1,670 tons to 14,771 tons, the bourse said on
June 25. That was the lowest level since January 2003, according
to Bloomberg data.  
 China, the largest auto market, is the biggest consumer of
natural rubber. The nation may increase gross imports of the raw
material to 1.68 million tons this year, from 1.59 million in
2009, according to a May report from the Association of Natural
Rubber Producing Countries.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost as much as 1.9 percent to 21,175 yuan ($3,119) a ton and
closed at 21,585.  
 Cash prices in Thailand extended losses as Chinese buyers
have delayed purchases, according to the  Rubber Institute of
Thailand . The Thai benchmark price plunged 2.1 percent today to
115.60 baht ($3.57) a kilogram, it said.
