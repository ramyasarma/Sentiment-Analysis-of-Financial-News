             Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi
said he was “amazed by the fantasy” of a press report today
saying that stress tests of the country’s banks showed that
three of the nation’s biggest lenders may need to raise 25
billion euros in additional capital.  
 Draghi said at a press conference in Rome that stress
testing banks “is a very complex process” that was just
beginning. He called any estimates of financing needs for
Italian banks “unfounded.”
