             U.K. stocks were little changed as
the European Central Bank said it will lend banks less than
economists had forecast, offsetting a report showing U.S.
companies added fewer jobs than predicted in June.  
 Barclays Plc advanced after the ECB said banks sought 131.9
billion euros ($162 billion) in three-month loans as a 12-month
facility expires. AstraZeneca Plc soared 7.5 percent as the
drugmaker gained U.S. patent protection for its Crestor
cholesterol pill. Rio Tinto Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. paced
basic-resource shares lower.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100  rose 2.65, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 4,916.87 after yesterday closing at a 10-month low. The  FTSE
All-Share Index  was also little changed.  
 The FTSE 100 has declined 13 percent this quarter on
concern a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is spreading and
authorities in China are moving to cool the world’s largest
emerging economy. Today’s ECB loans may help reduce investors’
perceptions of stress in credit markets, said  Lawrence Peterman ,
a London-based investment director at Eden Financial Ltd.  
 “The market got spooked yesterday so the ECB data is a bit
of a relief,” he said. “It doesn’t take away the longer-term
problems that are out there, but it will encourage some
investors to go bargain-hunting.”  
 U.S. Payrolls  
 European stocks pared earlier gains today after a report
showed companies in the U.S. added fewer workers to payrolls in
June than forecast. The 13,000 gain followed a revised 57,000
increase the prior month, data from ADP Employer Services
showed. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had anticipated an
increase of 60,000, according to the median forecast.  
 Barclays increased 1.2 percent to 270.55 pence. The 131.9
billion euros is less than a third of the 442 billion euros in
loans that banks need to repay tomorrow.  Laurent Fransolet , head
of European fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital, had
estimated banks would ask to borrow between 250 billion euros
and 300 billion euros.  
 AstraZeneca, the U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker, climbed
7.5 percent to 3,169 pence, the most since November 2008. U.S.
District Judge  Joseph J. Farnan Jr . ruled yesterday that a
patent on the active ingredient in Crestor is valid and
enforceable.  
 “With the Crestor overhang and risk of significant
downside removed, investment focus should shift to the potential
upside from a buyback program,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. in a report today, upgrading their recommendation on
the shares to “neutral” from “underweight.”  
 BP Climbs  
 BP Plc, which is battling the worst oil leak in U.S.
history, rebounded 5.3 percent from a 14-year low, to 318.9
pence after the first hurricane of the season headed away from
the leak. The track of Alex, the first June Atlantic hurricane
since 1995, keeps it away from the spill.  
 Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, the second- and third-largest
iron ore exporters, slumped 2.6 percent to 2,968.5 pence and 1
percent to 1,754.5 pence, respectively. European basic-resource
shares lost 2.6 percent today, the worst performance among 19
industry groups on concern about the outlook for the U.S.
economy following the ADP jobs report.  
 The following stocks also rose or fell in the U.K. and
Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 HMV Group Plc  (HMV LN) climbed 11 percent to 63 pence. The
music and DVD retailer that also owns Waterstone’s bookstores
said full-year profit rose 11 percent as it sold more Blu-ray
DVDs in its home U.K. and Irish markets.  
 Northgate Plc  (NTG LN) jumped 14 percent to 173.5 pence
after saying net income for the full year was 24.4 million
pounds compared with a net loss of 185.7 million pounds ($278
million) for the year earlier.
