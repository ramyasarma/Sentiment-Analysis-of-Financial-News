             The benchmark index for U.S. stock
 options  may increase to double its historic average on slower
economic growth in the U.S. and China and concern that Europe’s
credit crisis will worsen risk, BGC Partners Inc. said.  
 The  VIX , as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index  is known, may remain in the 25 to 40 range in the “near
term” and remain above 30 for “several weeks,”  Michael Purves , head of derivatives research at the New York-based firm,
wrote in a report. The VIX jumped 18 percent yesterday to 34.13,
two-thirds above its  two-decade average , as stocks plunged
around the world.  
 “We see volatility in European headlines, volatility in
Chinese economic news flow and the potential for slowing U.S.
recovery into the second half will keep complacency in check,”
Purves wrote yesterday.  
 The VIX measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , which
plummeted to its lowest level since Oct. 30 on weakening growth
in China and a slump in U.S. consumer confidence.  
 VIX futures  rose with July contracts gaining 3.4 percent to
33.50, while August’s climbed 2.4 percent to 33.45 as  stocks 
sank from Shanghai to New York yesterday, with the MSCI World
Index losing the most in 14 months, and two-year Treasury yields
slid to a record low.  
 Further declines in the S&P 500 may push the VIX to about
40, while better-than-forecast earnings reports in July for U.S.
companies could counter such a move, Purves said.  
 The VIX has  tumbled  by 25 percent since surging to a 14-
month high in May on concern that European governments couldn’t
contain the sovereign-debt crisis.  
 The measure jumped to a record 80.86 in November 2008 after
New York-based securities firm Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy, freezing credit markets. The VIX never
exceeded 50 before Lehman failed in September 2008. It topped 40
after WorldCom Inc.’s 2002 bankruptcy, the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, Long-Term Capital Management’s collapse in 1998 and the
Asian financial crisis in 1997.
