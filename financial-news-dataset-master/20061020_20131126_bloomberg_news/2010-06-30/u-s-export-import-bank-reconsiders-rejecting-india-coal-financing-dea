             The U.S. Export-Import Bank will
reconsider its rejection of a loan guarantee for  Bucyrus
International Inc.  so it can sell coal-mining equipment for a
power project being developed by India’s  Reliance Power Ltd.   
 The bank acted after Democratic lawmakers in Wisconsin,
where Bucyrus is based, appealed the rejection last week of $560
million in financing on environmental grounds. Reliance told the
bank it may buy U.S. equipment for a renewable energy project,
bank Chairman  Fred Hochberg  said in a letter.  
 The bank “will take into account Reliance’s expressed
commitment to invest in the renewable energy sector” in its
review, Hochberg wrote to Reliance chairman  Anil Ambani  today.  
 Bucyrus would lose an order worth as much as $560 million
for electric drag lines and rope shovels to mine coal without
getting the Export-Import bank’s guarantee, Bucyrus Chief
Executive Officer  Timothy Sullivan  said in an interview June 28.
The financing request was turned down last week as part of the
lender’s review of the project because of its potential carbon
emissions.  
 Reliance Power of Mumbai was awarded the project to build a
power plant in  Sasan , India, in July 2007, using coal mined
nearby with Bucyrus’s equipment.  
 According to Hochberg’s letter, which was provided by the
office of Wisconsin Senator  Herb Kohl , both sides have the
“desire” for Reliance to use equipment from U.S. companies at
its 250 megawatt renewable energy power plant.
