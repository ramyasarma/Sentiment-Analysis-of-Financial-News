             Kuwait’s parliament today approved a
budget for the fiscal year through March 2011 that increases
spending as the government seeks to boost economic growth by
developing infrastructure.  
 The budget, approved by 39 lawmakers and rejected by 21,
has a projected deficit of 6.6 billion dinars ($22.2 billion).
Spending is forecast at 16.3 billion dinars and revenue at 9.7
billion dinars. By law, 10 percent of revenue must be saved in
the Reserve Fund for Future Generations.  
 The budget is based on an oil price of $43 a barrel, up
from $35 per barrel in the last fiscal year. Oil is currently
trading at about $76 a barrel. Kuwait had a preliminary surplus
of 8.2 billion dinars in the last financial year, compared with
a forecast deficit of 4.9 billion dinars, as it earned more than
twice as much as forecast in oil revenue.  
 The government budgeted for 12.1 billion dinars of spending
last year. It spent 9.75 billion dinars, according to
preliminary figures.  
 Even some lawmakers who voted in favor of the budget warned
that such growing outlays, especially on a higher government
payroll, aren’t sustainable in the longer term.  
 “If we continue increasing spending at that rate, we will
lead the country to bankruptcy,” lawmaker Rola Dashti said
during the debate. “We need to produce 1 million barrels of oil
a day just to pay for salaries. Ten years ago, we had to produce
350,000 barrels a day for the same purpose.”  
 Parliament in February approved a 30.8 billion dinar, four-
year development plan including investments to increase oil and
gas production and to build a railway network, cities and a port
on Boubyan Island. Kuwait was the third-biggest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in May, pumping
2.35 million barrels of oil a day, according to Bloomberg data.
