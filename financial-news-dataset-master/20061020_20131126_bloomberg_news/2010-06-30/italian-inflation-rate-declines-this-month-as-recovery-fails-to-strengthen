             Italy’s  inflation rate  rose to the
highest in 19 months in July as higher energy prices boosted
electricity and transportation costs.  
 The  inflation rate  based on European Union measurements
rose to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent in June, the Rome-based
national statistics office Istat said in a preliminary report
today. The rate was higher than the 1.7 percent median forecast
of 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Prices fell 0.9
percent from the previous month after the start of the summer
sales season in July.  
 Transportation costs gained the most from a year earlier,
rising 4.6 percent on a non-harmonized basis. The cost of
housing, water and electricity gained 2.2 percent.  
 Based on Italian methodology prices rose 0.4 percent in
July from the previous month and gained 1.7 percent from a year
earlier, Istat said.  
 Final consumer-price data will be released on Aug 12.
