             Crude oil fell, capping the first
quarterly decline since 2008, after a government report showed
an unexpected increase in U.S. gasoline stockpiles.  
 Gasoline inventories  rose 537,000 barrels to 218.1 million
last week, the Energy Department said. Supplies of distillate
fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, climbed
the most in two months, as  crude oil  fell 2.01 million barrels.  
 “This report is net bearish,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “When we see
product inventories growing, the consumer can feel more secure
because the risk of a refinery disruption is reduced. Who cares
if we are short crude if there is plenty of fuel on hand?”  
 Crude oil for August delivery dropped 31 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $75.63 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the lowest settlement since June 14. Futures fell 9.7 percent
for the quarter and 4.7 percent this year.  
 Gasoline for July delivery slipped 1.14 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.0606 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since June 11. Heating oil for July delivery declined 3.96
cents, or 2 percent, to end the session at $1.9817 a gallon, the
lowest since June 8.  
 Stockpiles of gasoline were forecast to decrease by 400,000
barrels, according to the median response of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Supplies of  crude oil  were estimated
to drop 1 million barrels.  
 “There’s something here for everybody,” said  Kyle Cooper ,
managing director at energy consultant IAF Advisors in Houston.
“There’s bearish information for people looking for it, and
bullish information as well. Oil seems reasonably valued between
$70 and $80.”  
 Fuel Stockpiles  
 Supplies of  distillate fuel  climbed 2.46 million barrels to
159.4 million, the highest level since the week ended Jan. 8,
the report showed. Analysts forecast a 950,000-barrel gain.  
 The increase in fuel supplies narrowed the  margin , or crack
spread, for processing three barrels of oil into two of gasoline
and one of heating oil to the lowest level since April 8. The
margin slipped 3.1 percent to $10.251 a barrel, based on New
York futures prices.  
 “We’re seeing the main reaction to the DOE report in the
crack spread, which makes sense,” said  Hamza Khan , an analyst
with market intelligence publisher Schork Group Inc. in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “Crude oil futures are strong in
relation to the products.”  
 Weak Demand  
 Total fuel consumption  declined  2.7 percent to 19 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since April, the report showed.
Gasoline demand rose 2.4 percent to 9.46 million, the highest
level since August.  
 “Overall fuel consumption remains very weak,” Cooper
said. “It may be above the dismal levels of a year ago, but
that’s not saying much. Conversely, people must still be driving
because gasoline was the one bright spot.”  
 Oil in New York has been above the 40-day moving average
since June 15. A settlement below that point, which stands at
$74.31, would be a technical indicator that prices will extend
declines, said  Michael Fitzpatrick , vice president of energy at
MF Global in New York.  
 “We could soon close below the 40-day moving average,
which would be a signal for all the technical traders to sell,”
Fitzpatrick said.  
 Hurricane Alex  
 Hurricane Alex, the first June Atlantic hurricane since
1995, is prompting oil and gas companies in the Gulf of Mexico
to evacuate offshore workers and prepare for possible storm
surges that may disrupt production at coastal refineries. About
25 percent of crude production in the Gulf and 9 percent of
natural-gas output has been halted, the U.S. government said.  
 Alex had maximum sustained winds 85 mph (137 kph) at 1 p.m.
Houston time, according to a National Hurricane Center bulletin.
It’s heading for landfall in northeastern Mexico.  
 “The hurricane is being discounted before making landfall
because it looks like it is moving away from oil infrastructure
and will hit the Mexican coast,” said  Peter Beutel , president
of energy adviser Cameron Hanover Inc. in New Canaan,
Connecticut.  
 Brent crude oil for August delivery declined 43 cents, or
0.6 percent, to end the session at $75.01 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract slipped
9.3 percent this quarter, and 3.7 percent this year.  
 Oil volume on the Nymex was 540,677 contracts at 3:14 p.m.
in New York. Volume totaled 524,019 contracts yesterday, 32
percent less than the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.26 million contracts.
