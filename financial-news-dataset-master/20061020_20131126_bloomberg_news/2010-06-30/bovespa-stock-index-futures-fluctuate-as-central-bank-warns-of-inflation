             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index gained
for a second session, completing the biggest two-day rise since
May, as traders pared bets for higher interest rates after
Brazil’s consumer prices were unchanged in June.  
 Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes ,
Brazil’s biggest homebuilder by revenue, climbed 1.3 percent.
 Banco Bradesco SA , Brazil’s second-biggest lender by market
value, advanced after Bank of America Corp. recommended buying
the stock on “attractive valuations.” Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras SA, Brazil’s biggest utility, jumped after Valor
Economico reported it is seeking another private partner to help
it build the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in Brazil.  
 “Everyone’s so worried about the market abroad, but we are
living through a very favorable moment here at home,” said
 Debora Morsch , who helps manage 700 million reais ($397 million)
at Solidus Brokerage in Porto Alegre, Brazil. “Inflation is
well-contained and came out better than expected.”  
 The Bovespa stock index gained 2 percent to 63,283.80 at
4:14 p.m. New York time. Forty-seven stocks rose on the index
while 18 fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  rose 1.1 percent
to 1,170.59. The real rose 0.9 percent to 1.7646 per dollar,
from 1.7796 yesterday.
