             Corn prices surged the most in nine
months after a U.S. report showed farmers planted less than they
intended and inventories from last year’s record crop were
smaller than forecast.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 28 cents, or 8.2
percent, to $3.7225 a bushel at 10:09 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. A close at the price would mark the biggest increase
since Sept. 15. Earlier, the grain jumped 30 cents, the exchange
limit.  
 Farmers sowed 87.872 million acres (35.6 million hectares),
below a prior government forecast, as wet, cold weather last
month reduced plantings, the Department of Agriculture said
today in a report. Inventories on June 1 were 4.31 billion
bushels. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected 4.624 billion.  
 “Planted acreage is 1.3 million acres less than people
were expecting,” said  David Smoldt , the vice president of
operations at FCStone LLC in West Des Moines, Iowa. “Smaller
stocks on June 1 were a big surprise,” signaling livestock and
ethanol producers used more of last’s year lower-quality crop,
he said.  
 Before today, corn futures fell 17 percent this year on
speculation that warm, wet weather would boost U.S. yields.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.
