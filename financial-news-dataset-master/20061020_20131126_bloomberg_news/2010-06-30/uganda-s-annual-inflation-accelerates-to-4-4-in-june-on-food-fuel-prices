             Uganda’s annual inflation rate rose
to 4.4 percent in June after the prices of some foods, charcoal
and kerosene climbed, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said.  
 Price growth accelerated from an annual 4.3 percent in May,
the agency said today in a statement handed to reporters in the
capital, Kampala. Prices gained by 0.5 percent in the month.  
 The increase in prices of cabbage, onions, sugar, fish and
milk was offset by a decrease in costs of beans and maize flour,
the bureau said.  
 “The decrease in prices of some food items is mainly
attributed to supplies to the markets as the harvesting season
starts,” the statistics office said.  
 Prices of household and personal goods, second-hand
clothes, and meals in restaurants advanced in the month, the
bureau said. Underlying inflation, which excludes food, fuel,
electricity and metered water, was unchanged from the revised
4.5 percent in May, the agency said.  
 Uganda, with a population of 31 million people and a $16
billion economy, according to the World Bank, is Africa’s
biggest coffee exporter, according to the International Coffee
Organization.
