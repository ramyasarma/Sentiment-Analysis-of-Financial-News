             Russia could acquire a stake in
Renault SA if the French carmaker decides to increase its
holding in  OAO AvtoVAZ , Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said.  
 Russia has raised the possibility of a swap in which it
would get part of the French government’s 15 percent holding in
Renault if the French company increased its stake in AvtoVAZ,
controlled by Russia’s government, Putin said.  
 “We’ve discussed it recently,” the prime minister said
today at a technology conference near Moscow. “It would be an
interesting, very powerful cooperation.”  
 Renault has no plans to raise its stake in AvtoVAZ,
spokeswoman Sylvie Blanchet said by phone. “We’ve always said
we’re very happy with our 25 percent stake, and we continue to
be happy with it,” she said.  
 Renault in December 2007 agreed to pay $1 billion for 25
percent of AvtoVAZ. Renault, along with  Nissan Motor Co. , its 43
percent-owned Japanese affiliate, is planning to assemble a new
line of models for the Russian market at the AvtoVAZ plant in
Togliatti, in the southern part of the country. The cars would
be sold under all three automakers’ brands.  
 French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s office did not
immediately return calls seeking comment on the Russian
proposal.
