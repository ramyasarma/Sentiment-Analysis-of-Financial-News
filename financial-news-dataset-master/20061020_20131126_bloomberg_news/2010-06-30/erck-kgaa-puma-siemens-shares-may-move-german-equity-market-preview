             The following is a list of companies
whose shares may have unusual price changes in Germany. Stock
symbols are in parentheses and prices are from the last close.  
 The benchmark DAX Index slumped 3.3 percent to 5,952.03.  
 Merck KGaA  (MRK GY): Elmar Schnee, head of the company’s
pharmaceutical operations, expects an operating margin at its
Serono unit of as much as 25 percent, Platow Brief reported,
without saying where it got the information. The drugmaker is
confident its filing for cladribine, an experimental multiple
sclerosis pill, will be accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, the newsletter said. The shares dropped 2.1
percent to 60.36 euros.  
 Puma AG  (PUM GY): The second-largest European sporting-
goods maker said it will receive all trademark rights in Spain
and will take over the operational business in the country.  
 The former Spanish license holder, Estudio 2000 SA, will

The vesting is subject to a payment of as much as 98 million
euros ($119 million), which Puma will oppose. The shares sank
4.1 percent to 221.30 euros.  
 Siemens AG  (SIE GY): Europe’s largest engineering company
plans to take a 49% stake in the offshore-wind installation unit
of Danish utility Dong Energy A/S for about 860 million kroner
($141 million). The shares fell 3.9 percent to 73.55 euros.
