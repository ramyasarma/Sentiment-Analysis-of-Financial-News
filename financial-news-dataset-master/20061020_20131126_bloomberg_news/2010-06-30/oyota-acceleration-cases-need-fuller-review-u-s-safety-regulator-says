             Toyota Motor Corp.  vehicles involved
in reports of unintended acceleration must be probed for all
possible causes, the top U.S. auto-safety regulator said today.  
 “We must do everything possible to fully understand if
there are vulnerabilities in these systems to cause this
happening,”  David Strickland , head of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, said today at the first meeting
of a National Academy of Sciences panel reviewing the issue.  
 Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, has attributed
bursts of speed in its vehicles to accelerators that stuck or
snagged on floor mats. The company has said there is no evidence
of faults in electronic throttle controls, a contention
questioned by a number of lawmakers and auto-safety advocates.  
 The phenomenon of unintended acceleration has been reported
for “every major automaker,” Strickland said today.  
 The science academy’s review follows record recalls by
Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota of more than 8 million cars and
trucks globally. NASA, the U.S. space agency, is reviewing the
matter separately at the request of NHTSA.
