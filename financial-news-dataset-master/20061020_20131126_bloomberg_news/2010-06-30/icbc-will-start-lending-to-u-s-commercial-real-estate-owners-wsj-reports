             Industrial and Commercial Bank of 
China, China’s biggest bank, will offer loans of $100 million 
or more to U.S. real-estate owners, the Wall Street Journal 
reported.  
 While most U.S. banks avoid such loans at present, ICBC, 
which is 70 percent owned by the Chinese government, reckons 
U.S. real-estate values have fallen far enough for the risk to 
be acceptable, the newspaper said.
