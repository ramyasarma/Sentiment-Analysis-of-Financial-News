             Treasuries fell after the European
Central Bank loaned institutions less money than some analysts
had expected, reducing demand for safety that had sent the
securities to their best first half in 15 years.  
 Two-year Treasuries declined for the first time in four
days, pushing the yield up from a record low. European equities
and U.S. stock-index futures climbed after the ECB said banks
sought 131.9 billion euros ($161.8 billion) in three-month
loans.  Laurent Fransolet , head of European fixed-income strategy
at Barclays Plc, estimated that they would ask for 250 billion
euros to 300 billion euros.  
 “It was quite a surprise, and it’s taken away a bit of the
risk aversion,” said  Glenn Marci , a fixed-income strategist in
Frankfurt at DZ Bank AG, Germany’s biggest cooperative lender.
“The market is reassessing its mood and deciding whether they
want to shift to a more positive outlook.”  
 The two-year  yield  increased two basis points to 0.63
percent at 7:25 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor Market
Data. The 0.625 percent  security  due June 2012 dropped 1/32, or
31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100. Ten-year  yields 
increased 2 basis points to 2.97 percent, after tumbling below 3
percent yesterday for the first time since April 2009.  
 European banks need to repay 442 billion euros in 12-month
funds tomorrow, the biggest amount ever awarded by the ECB and a
key part of its efforts to ward off the financial crisis last
year.  
 Jobs Report  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.4 percent, rebounding
from a 3 percent slump yesterday. The gauge has still fallen 7.2
percent since March 31.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  futures
climbed 0.8 percent.  
 Declines in Treasuries may be limited amid speculation that
reports this week will signal the economic recovery is stalling.
A report today will show U.S. business activity expanded at a
slower pace, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists,
while an employment report in two days is forecast to show
115,000 job losses.  
 “The market is starting to become more pessimistic about
the growth outlook next year, probably not yet playing double-
dip, but at least quite a weak economic scenario,” said
 Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in
Munich. “It will depend very much on the labor market report
whether we will keep these low yield levels.”  
 Two-year yields yesterday broke the prior low of 0.6044
percent, which was set Dec. 17, 2008, after the Federal Reserve
cut its  target  for overnight bank lending to a range of zero to
0.25 percent as it tried to stem the global financial crisis.  
 First Half Returns  
 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. will
probably say today that its business barometer fell to 59 in
June from 59.7 in May, according to the median estimate of 54
economists. A Labor Department report on July 2 will show the
world’s biggest economy lost 115,000 jobs in June, after gaining
431,000 in May, according to a separate Bloomberg News survey.  
 Treasuries returned 5.8 percent in the first six months of
2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show, while the  MSCI
World  Index of shares plunged 10 percent. Treasuries’ first-half
rally is the steepest since 1995, when the Fed was preparing to
cut interest rates to spur growth.  
 German bunds have gained 7 percent this year, U.K. gilts
have rallied 5.5 percent, the Bank of America indexes show.  
 Over the past three months, Treasuries gained 4.7 percent,
the best quarter since the height of the financial crisis at the
end of 2008.  
 The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, fell to 1.89 percentage points from this
year’s high of 2.49 percentage points in January.
