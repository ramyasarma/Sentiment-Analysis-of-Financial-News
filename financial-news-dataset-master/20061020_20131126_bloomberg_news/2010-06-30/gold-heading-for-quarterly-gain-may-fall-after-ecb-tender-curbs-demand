             Gold, little changed in New York,
may fall on signs that Europe’s financial industry may be
stronger than investors estimated, curbing demand for the
metal as a means of protecting wealth.  
 The European Central Bank said it would lend banks 131.9
billion euros ($161.5 billion) for three months, less than some
analysts forecast. Gold is headed for its biggest quarterly
advance since the end of 2007.  
 “One of the reasons for gold being a bit lower is the
European Central Bank” news, said  Peter Fertig , owner of
Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg, Germany.
“It’s easing a little bit the fears of investors and therefore
the appeal of gold as a safe haven.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August lost $3.30, or 0.3
percent, to $1,239.10 an ounce at 8:49 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are up 11 percent this quarter. Gold for immediate
delivery in London was 0.2 percent lower at $1,238.40.  
 “Demand for gold as a safe haven will remain strong, which
should oppose any major declines in prices,”  Eugen Weinberg ,
head of commodity research with Commerzbank AG, wrote in a
report. “Due to the currently high price level, profit-taking
by short-term oriented investors is increasing.”
