             Japan, Asia’s biggest shipper of
copper cathode, may export 8.5 percent less than previously
forecast this year amid increased domestic demand and slowing
Chinese demand growth,  Pan Pacific Copper Co.  said.  
 Japan’s biggest producer forecast exports of the refined
copper will drop to 540,000 metric tons from an earlier estimate
of 590,000 tons for 2010,  Hidenori Kamoo , general manager of the
marketing department, said in an interview yesterday. The new
estimate is 14 percent less than record shipments in 2009,
mostly to China, the biggest consumer of the metal.  
 The price of copper, used in pipes, tubes and wires, has
jumped about 28 percent in the past year as stimulus measures
helped the global economy. Japan’s Cabinet Office raised its
economic growth forecast last week to 2.6 percent from 1.4
percent for the year ending March 31. That would be the fastest
expansion in a decade.  
 “Domestic demand has been recovering, especially from the
auto and semiconductor sectors,” Kamoo said. “Demand from the
construction sector now appears to have hit bottom.”  
 The  Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers’ Association 
said last week its cable shipments rose 11 percent in May from a
year earlier, gaining for the fifth straight month, while the
 Japan Copper and Brass Association  said its output jumped 50
percent in May, the seventh straight monthly increase.  
 Domestic Demand  
 Domestic demand may increase 14 percent from a year earlier
to 1 million tons this year, Kamoo said. The company previously
forecast demand of 950,000 tons for this year. Tight scrap-
copper supplies have also led domestic alloy fabricated product
makers to seek cathode, dragging stockpiles down, Kamoo said.  
 “There is also a shortage of scrap in South Korea,
tightening overall copper supplies in East Asia,” he said.  
 Japan is expected to produce 1.5 million tons of copper in
2010, up from 1.44 million tons in 2009, he said.  
 The company plans to produce between 570,000 and 580,000
tons in the year started from April 1, exporting 40 percent of
its output this year. China accounts for about 60 percent of its
exports.  
 China’s copper consumption is projected to increase to 7
million tons in 2010 and 7.4 million tons in 2011, Kamoo said,
citing data issued this month by the  Beijing General Research
Institute of Mining & Metallurgy . The country consumed 6 million
tons in 2009.  
 In 2010, China’s copper demand is expected to grow 8
percent in the third quarter from the same period a year earlier
and 7 percent in the fourth quarter after jumping 36 percent in
the first quarter and 19 percent in the second quarter,
according to the data.  
 China’s demand growth “will slow in the second half on a
removal of export rebates, tightening monetary policy, the
strengthening yuan and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis,” said
Kamoo, who visited China last week.  
 “That doesn’t mean China’s demand will disappear. Copper
prices will remain bullish for the time being,” he said.
