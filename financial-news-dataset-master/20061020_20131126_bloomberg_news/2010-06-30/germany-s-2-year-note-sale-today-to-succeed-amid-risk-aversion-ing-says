             Germany’s sale of 6 billion euros
($7.3 billion) of two-year notes today should be a success as an
increase in risk aversion boosts investor demand for the safest
assets, according to ING Groep NV.  
 “Given the backdrop, the auction should not be a problem
as this type of safe paper is exactly what the market is
migrating toward,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market
strategy at ING in Amsterdam, wrote in a client note today.  
 The two-year yield was little changed at 0.54 percent as of
8:45 a.m. in London.
