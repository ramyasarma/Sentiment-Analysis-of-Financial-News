             Bayer AG  resolved a lawsuit brought
by  Syngenta AG  challenging the validity of three Bayer U.S.
patents on insect-resistance seed traits.  
 Terms weren’t disclosed in papers filed yesterday in
federal court in Washington after Bayer had claimed Syngenta
needed a patent license to sell genetically modified corn with
the insect-resistant traits and Syngenta contended the patents
are invalid.  
 U.S.-based representatives from Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer and Basel, Switzerland-based Syngenta didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment.  
 The case is Syngenta Seeds Inc. v. Bayer Bioscience NV,
09cv2370, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
(Washington).
