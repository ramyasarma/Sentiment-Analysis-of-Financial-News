             British soldiers on active duty
overseas can’t rely on the Human Rights Act in a case involving
a soldier who died of a heart attack caused by heatstroke in
Iraq, the U.K.’s highest court ruled.  
 The Supreme Court in London  said  today that it wasn’t
“desirable” or “practicable” for soldiers to be
automatically protected by the act wherever they are, which
includes the right to life.  
 The case was brought by the family of Private Jason Smith
who died while on his base in Basra in 2003. The court ruled
that, while a Coroner’s Inquest can investigate whether Smith’s
right to life was breached on the base, soldiers in the field
don’t have the same legal protections.  
 “We have rights, why can’t we carry them outside this
country?” Catherine Smith, Jason Smith’s mother said outside
the court today. “It’s making them second class.”  
 She said she can’t appeal the case to the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg because she won the part of the case
involving her son.  
 “This outcome is not about denying rights to our people,
it is about ensuring that we have a clear and workable set of
rules under which they can carry out their demanding and
dangerous work,” Air Chief  Marshal Jock Stirrup , the Chief of
the Defense Staff, said in a statement. “My sympathies remain
with Mrs. Smith and her family.”
