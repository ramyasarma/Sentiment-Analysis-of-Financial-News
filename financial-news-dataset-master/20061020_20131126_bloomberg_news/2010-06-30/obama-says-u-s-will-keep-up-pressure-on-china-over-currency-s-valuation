             President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
will keep up pressure on China over its currency valuation to
ensure fair trade.  
 “If China has a currency that’s undervalued, that makes
our exports more expensive, it makes their imports cheaper,”
Obama said in response to an audience question at an event in
Racine, Wisconsin. “So we have been putting pressure on them to
say, let’s make sure that we’re not favoring one side or
another.”  
 Obama discussed currency policy with Chinese President  Hu Jintao  while both were at the Group of 20 summit in Toronto last
week. Some lawmakers in Congress are pressing for stronger
action, including letting U.S. companies seek tariffs on Chinese
imports.  
 The People’s Bank of China has allowed the yuan to gain 0.7
percent since saying on June 19 that it was resuming a flexible
exchange rate to curb inflation and rebalance the economy away
from exports. It has set the daily fixing rate stronger than the
previous day’s close for six days in a row.  
 The yuan climbed 0.24 percent to 6.7814 a dollar at 5:30
p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trading System.  
 Obama has welcomed China’s move toward a more market-based
valuation for the yuan, while also saying the administration
would be monitoring the exchange rates.  
 U.S. government data show the  trade deficit  with China
reached $71 billion for the first four months of the year, up
5.7 percent from the same period of 2009.
