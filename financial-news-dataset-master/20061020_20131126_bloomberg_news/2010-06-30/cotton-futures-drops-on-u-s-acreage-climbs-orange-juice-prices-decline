             Cotton futures declined the most in
more than three weeks on concern that U.S. output is rising
while the economy may be struggling. Orange juice gained the
most since January.  
 U.S. farmers planted cotton on 10.909 million acres (4.41
million hectares), the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. The seeded area, the first increase since 2006, would be
up 19 percent from last year and the biggest jump since 1995.
Companies in the U.S. added fewer workers in June than forecast,
according to data from a private report based on payrolls.  
 “Expectations of higher output coupled with negative job
market news is pulling the market down,” said  Sid Love , the
president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services Inc. in
Overland Park, Kansas.  
 Cotton for December delivery declined 1.75 cents, or 2.2
percent, to 76.38 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
marking the biggest loss since June 4. The price fell 5.2
percent this quarter, the first drop in five.  
 Output in  India , the world’s biggest grower behind China,
may rise to a record 32.5 million bales of 170 kilograms (375
pounds) each in the year starting Oct. 1,  D.K. Nair , secretary
general of the  Confederation of Indian Textile Industry , said
today.  
 Orange Juice Jumps  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery jumped 5.45
cents, or 3.8 percent, to $1.4835 a pound in New York, marking
the biggest gain since Jan. 8. The commodity rose 9.7 percent
this quarter, the sixth straight rise.  
 “People are worried about the hurricane threat to
Florida,”  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures in
Tampa, Florida.  
 Hurricane Alex intensified today in the western Gulf of
Mexico, heading for landfall south of the Rio Grande, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said. The storm’s top winds were 85
mph as of 1 p.m. Houston time, up 5 mph from earlier in the day,
as its speed increased to 12 mph from 7.  
 Prices often fluctuate on storm forecasts during the
Atlantic hurricane season that lasts through November. Florida
is the world’s largest orange producer after Brazil.
