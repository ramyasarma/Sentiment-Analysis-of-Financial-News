             Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s
third-largest lender, said China Orient Asset Management Corp.
will extend 160 billion yuan ($23.6 billion) of bonds expiring
today by 10 years.  
 China’s Ministry of Finance will provide support for
payments of principal and interest on the bond, Beijing-based
Bank of China said in a  statement  to Hong Kong’s stock exchange
today. Orient issued the bonds to the bank’s predecessor in 2000.
The interest rate on the debt was left unchanged at 2.25 percent.  
 China’s government set up Orient, Huarong Asset Management
Co., Cinda Asset Management Corp. and Great Wall Asset
Management Corp. in 1999 to help rid the banking industry of 1.4
trillion yuan of  non-performing loans . The firms issued bonds to
banks as part of payments for assets they took over, and were
given 10 years to recover the soured debts.  
 China Construction Bank Corp. , the nation’s second-largest
bank, said last September that the finance ministry allowed
Cinda to extend the maturity of 247 billion yuan of bonds due
that day by a decade.
