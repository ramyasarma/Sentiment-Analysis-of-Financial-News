             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  didn’t mark
down values of mortgage-backed securities to drive down prices,
President and Chief Operating Officer  Gary Cohn  told a U.S.
panel examining collateral calls that almost toppled American
International Group Inc. in 2008.  
 “To me, it’s simple,” Cohn, 49, told the  Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission  today, responding to a question about what
basis the New York-based bank had for marks on its securities.
The legitimacy of marks are demonstrated by “actual trades and
the fact that we were willing and aggressively willing to
liquidate our portfolio back to our clients at those prices.”  
 Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street record for a U.S.
securities firm’s profits in 2007, is battling accusations from
regulators, members of Congress and former clients that it
designed mortgage-backed securities it knew would fail and bet
on their collapse by buying credit-default swaps, which pay out
in the event of a default. The commission is questioning Cohn
and Goldman Sachs’s chief risk officer,  Craig Broderick , in
Washington during the first half of a two-day hearing on
practices in the market for derivatives.
