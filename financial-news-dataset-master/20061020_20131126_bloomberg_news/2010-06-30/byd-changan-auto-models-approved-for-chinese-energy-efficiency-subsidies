             BYD Co. , backed by billionaire
 Warren Buffett , and  Chongqing Changan Automobile Co.  are
among 16 Chinese automakers approved for a government energy-
efficiency subsidy as China steps up efforts to curb
pollution and cut  fuel imports .  
 Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co.  and Beijing Hyundai Motor
Co. also make some of the  71 models  approved for the discount
of 3,000 yuan ($442) per car, the National Development and
Reform Commission said on its  website  today. The agency said
all the models are fitted with engines no bigger than 1.6
liters. BYD’s F0 minicar, Beijing Hyundai’s i30 compact and
Shanghai General Motors Co.’s Lova compact are on the list.  
 China’s government is trying to curb emissions as
increased vehicle ownership and industrialization have added
to pollution. About 44 percent of Chinese cities have an air-
quality level of 3 or below, according to the State
Information Center. China has five levels, with 1 indicating
the cleanest air, 3 meaning “slight” pollution and 5
representing “heavy” pollution.  
 The average fuel consumption of approved models is about
20 percent below “current standards,” the statement said.  
 Cars’ Gas Usage  
 China, the world’s second-largest  energy user , bought a
record 203.8 million metric tons of crude oil last year as
37,383 new vehicles were sold every day. The average fuel
consumption per vehicle is 2.28 tons a year, compared with
1.1 tons in Japan, according to the commission.  
 Total fuel consumption by automobiles accounted for 75.5
percent of China’s gasoline usage, according to official
statistics.  
 The government will choose more models to qualify for
the subsidies in the future, the statement said.  
 BYD  fell 3.6 percent to close at HK$58.3 in Hong Kong.
The stock has declined 15 percent so far this year.
