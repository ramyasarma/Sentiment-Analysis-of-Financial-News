             MF Global Holdings Ltd. , the futures
and options broker former New Jersey Governor  Jon Corzine  leads,
extended at a higher interest rate the maturity on more than
half of its $1.2 billion revolving credit line.  
 Lenders pushed out the due date on $690 million of the
unsecured line by two years, to June 15, 2014, the New York-
based company said in a statement today. The interest rate on
the extended portion is 2.75 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, or 0.75 percentage points higher
than the $510 million expiring earlier, MF Global said.  
 As of yesterday, the company said the $443 million
outstanding under its revolver carried a blended interest rate
of 2.43 percentage points over Libor, the rate banks charge to
lend to each other. MF Global said it had $2.7 billion of
 liquidity  as of March 31, after taking into account the latest
transaction.  
 “This amendment and extension continues MF Global’s
proactive efforts to enhance the company’s capital structure,”
Chief Financial Officer  Randy MacDonald  said in the statement.
“The new facility more than supports our long-term liquidity
requirements, reduces refinancing risk and provides us
flexibility.”  
 Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America
Corp., Credit Agricole SA’s corporate and investment bank unit
Calyon and HSBC Holdings Plc arranged a $1.5 billion revolver
maturing in five years for MF Global in 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
