             Corn futures may open 25 cents to 30
cents a bushel higher after the government said that U.S.
farmers planted fewer acres than they had planned, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in Minneapolis.  
 Farmers sowed 87.872 million acres (35.6 million hectares)
with corn, below a prior government forecast, as below-average
temperatures and wet weather in May interfered with field work,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a report.  
 Corn inventories from last year’s harvest totaled 4.31
billion bushels as of June 1, the USDA said in a quarterly
report on grain stockpiles. Analysts expected 4.624 billion
bushels, on average.
