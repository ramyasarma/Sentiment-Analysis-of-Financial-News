             BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, said third parties can negotiate to use
its Goldsworthy iron ore railway line in Western Australia
following a regulator’s decision.  
 The Australian Competition Tribunal rejected another
application for third parties to use its Newman rail line, BHP
said in an e-mailed statement today. The Melbourne-based
company said it was disappointed with the decision over
Goldsworthy.  
 BHP and  Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third- and second-
largest iron ore exporters, have been fighting applications by
rival  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.  to open their railways to
others, saying sales and investments may be curbed. BHP could
appeal the ruling to the Federal Court of Australia, it said.  
 “It is not in the public interest that our business or
customers should be disadvantaged through the increased
inefficiencies and costs that will result from other companies
operating their trains on our rail lines,”  Ian Ashby ,
BHP’s iron ore president, said in the statement.  
 Rio and BHP plan to combine mines, railroads, ports and
workforces in Western Australia’s Pilbara region in a 50-50
joint venture to save at least $10 billion. The deal is
opposed by steelmakers in Europe and Asia.
