             German private, publicly owned and
cooperative lenders are opposed to the planned publication of
results of a financial stress test,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  
 The Bundesbank, Germany’s central bank, and financial
regulator BaFin plan to meet with officials from the country’s
largest lenders today, according to people with knowledge of the
matter. Topics to be discussed will include publication of the
test results.
