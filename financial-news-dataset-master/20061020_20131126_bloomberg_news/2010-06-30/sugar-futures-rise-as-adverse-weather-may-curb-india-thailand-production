             Raw sugar rose the most in six weeks
on speculation that adverse weather will reduce crops in India,
the world’s second-biggest producer, and Thailand.  
 India’s monsoon rain, the main source of irrigation for the
nation’s 235 million farmers, was 15 percent below average as of
yesterday. Output in Thailand, the second-largest exporter, may
drop 13 percent in the next harvest as delayed rain and
subsequent floods will likely damage the cane crop.  
 “The weather conditions are a cause of concern,” said
 Bruno Lima , a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group in
Campinas, Brazil. “Also, demand is expected to remain strong in
the short term.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery gained 0.78 cent, or 5.1
percent, to 16.06 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the biggest gain since May 18. The sweetener gained 13 percent
this month, arresting a four-month slide. Prices have dropped 40
percent this year, the biggest half-year drop since 1985.  
 Futures more than doubled last year after excess rain in
Brazil, the biggest producer, and a weak monsoon in India
crimped output.  
 Refined-sugar futures for October delivery rose $11.50, or
2.5 percent, to $469.30 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London.
