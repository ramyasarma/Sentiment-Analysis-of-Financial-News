             The World Trade Organization ruled
that aid European governments provided to  Airbus SAS  violated
global trade rules, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office said.  
 The WTO ruled that four decades of government-backed loans
to the world’s largest maker of commercial aircraft helped it
gain foreign sales, harming U.S. competitor  Boeing Co. , the U.S.
trade agency said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 “This is a landmark decision and sweeping legal victory
over the launch-aid subsidies that fueled the rise of Airbus and
that continue to provide its products a major cost advantage,”
Boeing Chief Executive Officer  Jim McNerney  said in a statement.  
 The decision is set to be announced by the WTO today. An
initial, confidential ruling with similar findings circulated in
March.
