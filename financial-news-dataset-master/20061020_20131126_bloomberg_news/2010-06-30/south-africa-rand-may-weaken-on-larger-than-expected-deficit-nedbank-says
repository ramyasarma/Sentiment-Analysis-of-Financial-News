             South Africa’s trade deficit
probably expanded last month because of weakness in the global
economy and will cause the rand to weaken, Nedbank Treasury Head
of Research  Ian Cruickshanks  said.  
 Africa’s biggest economy probably posted a  trade shortfall 
of 2.5 billion rand ($327.5 million) in May, compared with a
deficit of 1.9 billion rand the previous month, according to the
 median estimate  of 12 economists polled by Bloomberg. The South
African Revenue Service is scheduled to publish the data at 2
p.m. in Pretoria today.  
 “If the trade deficit significantly overshoots consensus
then there could be an initial kneejerk weakening in the rand,”
Cruickshanks said in a telephone interview. “We’re looking for
a deficit of around 2.9 billion rand. Exports are likely to be
subdued because of the weakness in the global economy.”  
 A larger trade deficit would cause a widening of the
shortfall on South Africa’s  current account , the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services. The current-account
deficit is expected to reach 4.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year and 5.3 percent in 2011, the National Treasury
said on Feb. 17.  
 The rand strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to 7.6236 per
dollar and traded at 7.6568 by 10 a.m. in Johannesburg, from a
previous close of 7.6652. Against the euro, the rand weakened
0.2 percent to 9.3731.  
 Bonds  
 South Africa relies on foreign purchases of its stocks and
bonds to fund the shortfall and prevent the rand from weakening.
Foreign investors have purchased a net 58.3 billion rand of
South African assets this year, according to data from the JSE
Ltd., which runs the nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  
 Government bonds rose in South Africa with the benchmark
13.5 percent security due September 2015 gaining 8 cents to
122.58 rand. The yield on the bond decreased 2 basis points to
8.08 percent.  
 Investors maintained bets that South Africa’s central bank
may lower its 6.5 percent  benchmark interest rate  when it next
meets on July 22, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of
 three-month contracts  for cash in three months was unchanged
from the previous close at 6.435 percent. The rate reached a 6
1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.
