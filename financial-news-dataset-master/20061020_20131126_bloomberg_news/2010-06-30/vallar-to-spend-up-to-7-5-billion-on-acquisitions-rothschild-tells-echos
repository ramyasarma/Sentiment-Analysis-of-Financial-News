             Vallar Plc plans to spend as much as
5 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) for an acquisition in the
commodities industry,  Nathaniel Rothschild  told  Les Echos  in an
interview.  
 Rothschild, former co-president of Atticus Capital LLC and
the only son of British financier  Lord Jacob Rothschild , said
the Jersey, U.K.-based investment vehicle will seek out
companies that either need capital injections, have operating
problems that can be solved by Vallar or have a structure that
needs to be simplified, the French daily newspaper reported.
