             South Korea’s  National Pension
Service  plans to spend a net 6.9 trillion won ($5.6 billion)
boosting its domestic equity allocation next year, predicting
gains as growth in the country outpaces the global economy.  
 The nation’s biggest investor will increase the weighting
for domestic stocks to 18 percent of assets in 2011 from 16.6
percent planned this year, and lower the weighting for bonds,
the  Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs , which
oversees the fund, said in an e-mail today. On June 16, it kept
the five-year target to boost equities to at least 30 percent of
assets by end-2015.  
 “Equities are expected to be on an upward course in
accordance with an economic recovery at home and overseas,”
according to the statement. “After a correction in the first
half, gains may accelerate going into the latter half.”  
 South Korea’s economy may expand 4.5 percent in 2011, based
on estimates by local institutions, the central bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the ministry said. That’s faster
than the 4.3 percent expansion in global gross domestic product
forecast by the IMF in April. The  Kospi Index  has gained 0.1
percent this year, after falling as much as 7.7 percent, as
corporate profit growth was offset by concern that export demand
will be hurt by Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  
 The Korean fund plans to have 6.6 percent of assets in
overseas equities next year, compared with 5.1 percent targeted
for 2010, the ministry said. The fund’s size is expected to grow
to 336.5 trillion won by the end of 2011 from 303.3 trillion won
estimated for end-2010, it said.  
 Bond Weighting  
 National Pension Service aims to pare its 2011 domestic
bond weighting to 63.5 percent from 67.8 percent estimated for
this year, the health ministry said. The service, which will
keep its overseas bonds allocation target at 4.1 percent next
year, plans to invest in bonds of emerging nations to diversify
its portfolio and to boost its returns, it said.  
 “Investment in emerging nations’ bonds is attractive given
the high level of yields and relatively stronger economic growth
prospects,” the ministry said.  
 National Pension Service plans to increase its weighting of
so-called alternative investments to 7.8 percent of assets in
2011 from 6.4 percent estimated for this year, according to the
ministry. The pension fund, which was set up in 1988, covers
private-sector employees and those who are self-employed.
