             Novartis AG ’s Ciba Vision unit asked
a U.K. appeals court to reverse a ruling in an infringement
lawsuit against  Johnson & Johnson  that its European patent for
extended-wear contact lenses is invalid.  
 Novartis argued at the Court of Appeal in London today that
judges in the Netherlands and France had also considered the
same patent and arrived at different conclusions than the U.K.
court, which found the patent invalid due to “insufficient”
disclosure.  
 “Only in the United Kingdom has this patent been found to
be insufficient,” Novartis’s lawyer,  Andrew Waugh  of the firm
Three New Square in London, said at the hearing. The U.K.
judgment “is out on a limb.”  
 Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, sued in May 2007
claiming that J&J’s  Acuvue Oasys  lenses violate the patent by
using similar chemicals. J&J, the world’s biggest maker of
contact lenses, began selling Oasys in February 2005. Lawsuits
over the same lenses have also been filed in the U.S.  
 J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, argued in the U.K.
appeal that Novartis’s patent covers too much technology.  
 “A claim of such breadth is, on its face, vulnerable to
the allegations that it is either obvious or insufficient,” the
company’s lawyer,  Simon Thorley  also of Three New Square, said
in court papers.
