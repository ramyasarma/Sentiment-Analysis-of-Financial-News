             Apollo Group Inc ., owner of the
biggest for-profit university in the U.S. by enrollment, said
quarterly net income fell 11 percent as the company set aside
funds to cover the costs of a shareholder lawsuit.  
 Net income for the fiscal third quarter ended May 31 fell
to $179 million, or $1.18 a share, from $201 million, or $1.26 a
share, Phoenix-based Apollo said today in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire. Revenue rose 28 percent to $1.34
billion.  
 Shareholders filed lawsuits against Apollo in 2004,
charging that the company gave false and misleading information
about the contents of a U.S. Department of Education program
review, Apollo said. The cases were consolidated, and on June
23, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Apollo. The
company set aside $132.6 million to pay the costs of the suit,
Apollo said.  
 “We are evaluating our available options to challenge the
jury verdict or this ruling by the Court of Appeals,” the
company said today in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  
 Apollo shares fell 66 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $42.47 at 4
p.m. today in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The company
has lost 40 percent in the past 12 months.
