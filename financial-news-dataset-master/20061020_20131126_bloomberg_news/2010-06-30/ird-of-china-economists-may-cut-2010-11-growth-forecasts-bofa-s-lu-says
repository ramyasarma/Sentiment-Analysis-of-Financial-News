             A third of China economists may
reduce their “overly bullish” growth forecasts for 2010 and 2011
in coming weeks because of property tightening measures, Ting
Lu, a Hong Kong-based economist at Bank of America-Merrill
Lynch, wrote in a note to clients.  
 Lu recommended investors “downplay” the Conference
Board’s leading economic index for China. The nation’s equities
plunged yesterday after the Board revised down its April LEI
due to a “calculation error.”
