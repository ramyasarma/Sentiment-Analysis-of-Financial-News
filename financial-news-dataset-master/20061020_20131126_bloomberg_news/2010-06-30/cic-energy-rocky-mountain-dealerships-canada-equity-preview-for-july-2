             Canadian stocks  fell, extending a
weekly loss, after U.S. hiring and factory-order reports
signaled slower economic growth and gold producers declined on
yesterday’s drop in prices for the precious metal.  
 Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, dropped
4.9 percent as the Toronto Stock Exchange reopened after the
Canada Day holiday. Magna International Inc., Canada’s biggest
auto-parts maker, lost 2.5 percent as automakers announced
slower U.S. sales in June. Copper producer Taseko Mines Ltd.
sank 8 percent before the release of a government report on its
proposed Prosperity mine.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 98.36
points, or 0.9 percent, to 11,196.06. On the week, the benchmark
index declined 4.4 percent, the most in almost a year.  
 Today’s U.S. employment report “corroborates what’s been
happening the last week and a half,” said  Greg Eckel , who helps
manage about C$900 million ($850 million) at Morgan Meighen &
Associates Ltd. in Toronto. “The fundamental numbers coming out
certainly support the early taking of money off the table.”  
 The S&P/TSX slumped  6.2 percent  in the second quarter, the
most since 2008, on the risk of sovereign-debt default in Europe
and concern the Chinese economy may not grow as quickly as
previously forecast. Oil tumbled 9.7 percent and copper 17
percent during the period.  
 U.S. Data  
 U.S. private-sector payrolls increased 83,000, according
to the Labor Department, trailing the median estimate of
110,000.  Factory orders  in the U.S. retreated 1.4 percent in
May, the Commerce Department said today in Washington.
Economists forecast manufacturing bookies would decline 0.5
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Gold declined 3.2 percent yesterday as the euro currency
gained the most in 15 months. The European Central Bank said
June 30 that financial institutions asked for less money from
the bank than some analysts predicted.  
 Barrick declined 4.9 percent, the most in six months, to
C$45.95. Goldcorp Inc., Canada’s  second-largest  gold producer,
lost 5.7 percent to C$43.95. Eldorado Gold Corp., which mines in
Turkey and China, decreased 6 percent from a record high to
C$17.94.  
 Automakers sold 11.1 million vehicles in the U.S. last
month, down from 11.8 million in May, according to numbers
compiled by Autodata Corp. Magna fell 2.5 percent to C$68.41.
Linamar Corp., Canada’s second-largest auto-parts maker, dropped
2.9 percent to C$17.48.  
 Copper, Uranium  
 Taseko, which has operations in British Columbia, retreated
8 percent to a six-month low of C$4.16. A Canadian Environmental
Assessment Agency panel is to report late today on Taseko’s C$3
billion proposed Prosperity gold and copper mine, which is
opposed by some environmental and indigenous groups.  
 Uranium One Inc., which has a mining project in Australia,
led the S&P/TSX with a 5 percent surge to C$2.72. Australia’s
new prime minister,  Julia Gillard , agreed to cut a planned
mining tax to 30 percent from 40 percent.  
 BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd. slumped 2.3
percent to a 15-month low of C$51.11. The Indian government
planned to give RIM 15 days to prove BlackBerry data can be read
by security and intelligence agencies, the Times of India
reported yesterday.  
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, the world’s largest
fertilizer producer, fell for a sixth day, slipping 0.9 percent
to C$90.91. Citigroup Inc. analyst  P.J. Juvekar  cut his price
estimate on the company’s U.S.-listed shares to $96 from $122 to
reflect lower estimated fertilizer prices. Earlier today, the
stock sank as low as C$90, the lowest intraday price in 15
months.  
 Bombardier Inc., the world’s third-largest maker of civil
aircraft, rallied 3.1 percent to C$4.99 after receiving an order
for eight regional jets, valued at about $317 million, from
airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
