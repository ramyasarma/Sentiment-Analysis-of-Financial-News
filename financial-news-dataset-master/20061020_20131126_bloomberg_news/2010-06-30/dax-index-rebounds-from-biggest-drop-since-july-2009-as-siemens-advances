             German stocks  rose as unemployment
in the country fell and the European Central Bank said it will
lend banks less money than economists had forecast, offsetting a
report from ADP Employer Services that showed U.S. companies
added fewer jobs than forecast in June.  
 Deutsche Bank AG rebounded, while ThyssenKrupp AG and
Salzgitter AG followed European basic-resource shares lower.  
 The benchmark  DAX Index  rose 0.2 percent to 5,965.52, while
the broader  HDAX Index  also gained 0.2 percent. Stocks tumbled
yesterday, with the DAX losing 3.3 percent in its biggest drop
since July 2009, after U.S. consumer confidence declined and a
report sparked concern that China’s economy is growing at a
slower-than-estimated pace.  
 The ECB said it will lend banks 131.9 billion euros ($161.5
billion) for three months before a landmark yearlong loan
expires tomorrow. Economists had expected lenders to seek 200
billion euros, according to the median of seven estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 The number of out-of-work people in Germany declined by
21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 3.23 million, the lowest since
December 2008, the Federal Labour Agency in Nuremberg said
today. Unemployment was forecast to fall 30,000, according to
the median of 29 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The adjusted
jobless rate remained at 7.7 percent.  
 U.S. Payrolls  
 Stocks pared some gains after a report showed companies in
the U.S. added fewer workers to payrolls in June than forecast.
The 13,000 gain followed a revised 57,000 increase in May, data
from ADP based on payrolls showed today. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was an increase of 60,000.  
 Deutsche Bank , Germany’s biggest bank, rose 1.5 percent to
46.70 euros. Germany’s largest banks have agreed in principle to
participate in European stress tests, the Bundesbank and
financial regulator BaFin said in a joint statement today.  
 Arques Industries AG, the German holding company that owns
most of Siemens AG’s Gigaset cordless-phone operations, rallied
5.9 percent to 1.08 euros after saying it returned to profit in
the first quarter.  
 Logwin AG  surged 4.5 percent to 1.03 euros, its first gain
this week, as the stock was raised to “buy” from “hold” at
Equinet AG.  
 MLP AG  rose 1.3 percent to 7.31 euros as Merck Finck & Co.
lifted its recommendation on Germany’s third-biggest financial-
services broker to “buy” from “sell.”  
 ThyssenKrupp and Salzgitter retreated 1.4 percent to 20.35
euros and 0.9 percent to 48.99 euros, respectively. European
basic-resource shares lost 2.6 percent today, the worst
performance among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.
