             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  made Chief
Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  available for an interview
with the  Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission  and has been more
responsive to information requests from the panel, the FCIC’s
leaders said.  
 Blankfein, 55, was interviewed recently by FCIC staff “at
length” as part of its probe into causes of the 2008 credit-
market freeze, commission Chairman  Phil Angelides  said yesterday
in a conference call with reporters. Angelides said on June 7
that the FCIC subpoenaed Goldman Sachs after the bank tried to
hinder a probe by overwhelming the panel with documents.  
 “I have no question” that New York-based Goldman Sachs
will now cooperate with requests, FCIC Vice Chairman  Bill Thomas 
said on the call. “It was the lack of specificity, or even the
acknowledgement that what we asked for was in the piles of
documents we got, that was cleared up.”  
 Goldman Sachs executives including Chief Financial Officer
 David Viniar  and President  Gary Cohn  will testify at a two-day
FCIC hearing beginning today reviewing the role of derivatives
in the recession. Also scheduled to testify is  Joseph Cassano ,
55, the former  American International Group Inc.  executive whose
bets on subprime mortgages led the insurer to the brink of
collapse in 2008, requiring a U.S. bailout.  
 “This hearing is focused on derivatives which is a subset,
obviously, of what Goldman does, and if you want to get some
answers that are useful and meaningful you’d probably ask the
people who were head of that subset,” Thomas said, when asked
about the choice of executives to appear before the panel.  
 AIG Chief Risk Officer  Robert Lewis  will also testify as
will  Martin Sullivan , who was ousted as the insurer’s CEO in
2008 after the company was overwhelmed by losses on real estate-
related bets that he had projected would be “manageable.”  
 Dinallo, Gensler  
 Ex-New York Insurance Superintendent  Eric Dinallo  and  Gary Gensler , chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
are also scheduled to appear. The FCIC tried to compel former
Office of Thrift Supervision Director  John Reich  to testify,
said Tucker Warren, a spokesman for the commission.  
 The subpoena wasn’t served to Reich because he is outside
the U.S., Warren said. Attempts to reach Reich for comment
weren’t immediately successful. The OTS is one of AIG’s
regulators.  
 After AIG’s bailout, Goldman Sachs collected $12.9 billion
tied to contracts with the New York-based insurer, including
derivatives. AIG sold credit-default swaps to firms including
Goldman Sachs, Societe Generale SA and  Deutsche Bank AG 
protecting them against declines in the value of mortgages. When
the housing market collapsed, AIG didn’t have enough funds to
honor its contracts and turned to the U.S. for a rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion.  
 Joseph Cassano  
 Cassano, who oversaw an AIG unit managing $2 trillion in
derivative trades, was interviewed for about five hours by FCIC
staff. He had previously shied away from public statements while
regulators investigated his role in the swaps trades, which he
said in 2007 would be profitable.  
 “He was a person with extraordinary knowledge of the inner
workings of that company and the relationships with others,”
Angelides said.  
 The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said on May 26 that a
review of the business Cassano oversaw didn’t turn up any
criminal violations. U.S. prosecutors also won’t bring charges,
a person familiar with the investigation said last month.  
 Goldman Sachs was sued in April by U.S. regulators for
misleading clients who invested in collateralized debt
obligations. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that
investors weren’t told that the hedge fund led by  John Paulson 
helped pick the mortgages in the CDOs and was betting on them to
fail. Goldman Sachs has said the suit is unfounded.  
 Bear Stearns  
 Goldman Sachs, the highest-paying and most profitable firm
in Wall Street history, has been criticized by lawmakers as a
symbol of greed and excess. AIG and failed securities firm Bear
Stearns Cos. are among companies hobbled by losses on
investments from Goldman Sachs.  
 The commission is investigating the causes of the credit
crisis, which followed the collapse of the housing market
beginning in 2007 and sparked the worst recession since the
1930s and the loss of more than  8 million  U.S. jobs. It will
report its findings to Congress and President  Barack Obama  by
December.  
 Derivatives such as credit-default swaps contributed to the
crisis, making it difficult for regulators to understand how
interconnected financial firms had become after the bankruptcy
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.
