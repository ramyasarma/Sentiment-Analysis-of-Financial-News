             Asian  stocks  fell for a second day,
extending a global rout, as a slump in U.S. consumer confidence
fueled concerns about the strength of the global economy.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
declined 2.5 percent after the drop in the U.S. Conference
Board’s confidence index contributed to the biggest slump in
commodity prices in 10 months. Toyota Motor Corp. and  Canon Inc. ,
which get more than a quarter of their revenues in the Americas,
slid more than 1 percent in Tokyo as a stronger yen dented their
profit outlooks.  
 “Investors are getting excessively anxious about the future
of the global economy,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager
in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  dropped 1.4 percent to 112.38
as of 9:38 a.m. in Tokyo, set to close at the lowest level since
June 10. The gauge has slumped 13 percent from its high this
year on April 15 on concern Europe’s debt crisis and Chinese
steps to curb property prices will hurt global growth.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The gauge yesterday slumped 3.1 percent to its lowest
level since Oct. 30 after the Conference Board’s gauge of
confidence among consumers slumped to 52.9 this month from a
revised 62.7 in May as Americans became pessimistic about the
outlook for the labor market and the economy.  
 The MSCI World Index  dropped 0.4 percent. The gauge slid
3.2 percent yesterday after the Conference Board revised its
April leading economic index for China to a 0.3 percent increase
from a gain of 1.7 percent reported June 15. China’s exports
face “strong headwinds” in the second half of the year from
policy tightening measures and the European debt crisis,
Citigroup Inc. said in a report obtained yesterday.  
 BHP, Australia’s biggest oil producer, sank 2.5 percent to
A$37.16. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest mining
company, lost 3 percent to A$66.39.  Mitsubishi Corp. , which
trades commodities, fell 2.5 percent to 1,853 yen in Tokyo.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials tumbled
2.8 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 14. Copper futures in
New York lost 5.2 percent, while oil declined 3 percent.
