             Dexia SA said that it has exited
from the system of state capital and funding guarantees as of
today.  
 The bank is close to meeting its long-term funding target
for 2010, it said in an emailed statment. The bank received
billions of euros in capital and funding guarantees from France,
Belgium and Luxembourg during the credit crunch.
