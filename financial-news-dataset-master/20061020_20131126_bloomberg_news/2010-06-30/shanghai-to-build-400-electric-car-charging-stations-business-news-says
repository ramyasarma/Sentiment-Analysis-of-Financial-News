             The Shanghai government will build
400 charging stations for electric vehicles this year, China
Business News said, citing Liu Jianhua, an official in charge of
promoting alternative-energy vehicles in the city.  
 The city government will add SAIC Motor Corp.’s hybrid
vehicles, Roewe 750, to its purchase list in a bid to raise
awareness of alternative-energy vehicles, the newspaper said.
SAIC will begin selling Roewe 750 at the end of this year, it
said.
