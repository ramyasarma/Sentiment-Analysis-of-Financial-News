             Corn futures gained in Chicago,
trimming the second monthly decline as a slump in the past seven
sessions attracted investors and importers.  
 Corn for December delivery rose as much as 1.1 percent to
$3.4775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at
$3.4725 at 12:03 p.m. in Paris. The most-active contract has
lost 2 percent this month after falling 4.3 percent in April.  
 The December-delivery corn contract had lost 9.6 percent
between June 18 and yesterday on expectations that farmers in
the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter, may expand
planting, allowing the harvest to beat last year’s record.  
 “We might be seeing a little bit of a bounce,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia said by phone from Sydney. Investors may be buying
corn contracts “to minimize the risk” that plantings may not
be as big as the market expects, he said.  
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture is scheduled to update
its crop-acreage estimates in Washington today. U.S. farmers
will plant 89.252 million acres (36.119 million hectares) of
corn, according to the average estimate of 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. That’s 0.5 percent more than farmers said they
intended to plant in March and up 3.2 percent from 86.482
million acres in 2009.  
 The most-active corn contract has gained 0.8 percent this
quarter, following a 17 percent plunge in the first quarter.  
 The USDA estimates U.S. farmers will reap 13.37 billion
bushels of corn in the year that starts September, with 88.8
million acres planted with the grain, beating last record
harvest of 13.11 billion bushels.  
 Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.3 percent to $9.145
at 1:10 p.m. Paris time. The most active contract is set for a
2.7 percent decline this quarter.  
 Planting Increases  
 The area planted with soybeans will total 78.161 million
acres, up from 78.1 million forecast in March and a 0.9 percent
increase from last year’s 77.451 million, according to the
survey of analysts. Farmers are wrapping up planting of the
soybean crop after wet weather delayed seeding. Corn and spring-
wheat seeding were completed earlier this month.  
 Soybean imports by China, the world’s biggest buyer, may be
more than 50 million metric tons next year, driven by rising
wealth as rural inhabitants move into cities, Phillip Laney,
China country director for the U.S. Soybean Export Council said
in an interview yesterday. That’s more than the 49 million tons
estimated by the USDA on June 10.  
 Wheat for September delivery rose 1.1 percent to $4.62 a
bushel, trimming the loss for the most-active contract to 0.5
percent this quarter.  
 The wheat inventory in the U.S., the world’s largest
shipper, may be 940 million bushels on June 1, before this
year’s harvest, 41 percent more than the 667 million bushels a
year earlier, according to the survey.  
 Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 1.2 percent to 142.50 euros a metric ton at 12:17
p.m. local time. The contract has climbed 10 percent in the
quarter as the euro’s 9 percent decline against the dollar in
the period made European wheat exports more competitive.
