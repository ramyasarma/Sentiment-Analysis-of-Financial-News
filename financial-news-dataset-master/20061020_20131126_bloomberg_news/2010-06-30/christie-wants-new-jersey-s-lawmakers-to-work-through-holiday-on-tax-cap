             New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
plans to order daily sessions of the Legislature through the
July 4th holiday weekend if lawmakers don’t vote on his proposal
to cap property-tax increases at 2.5 percent annually.  
 Democrats, who control the Senate and Assembly, are
resisting calls by Republican Christie to approve voter
consideration of an amendment to the state constitution that
would limit property taxes, the highest in the nation at an
average of $7,281 per year. Lawmakers would have to pass the
proposed amendment by the end of next week for it to appear on
the ballot in November, according to state law.  
 Christie, 47, who took office in January, plans to begin
the special sessions with a speech to lawmakers at 3 p.m.
tomorrow. He will call daily sessions through the three-day
holiday weekend, although the schedule is still being worked
out, his spokesman, Michael Drewniak , said today.  
 “There’s work to do,” Drewniak said. “This is vitally
important public policy that needs to be addressed.”  
 Senate President  Stephen Sweeney , a Gloucester County
Democrat, and Assembly Majority Leader  Joseph Cryan  of Union
County, said earlier this week that lawmakers will convene in
Trenton tomorrow as Christie demanded, without voting on the
governor’s proposal.  
 The two lawmakers, whose chambers passed legislation
limiting local tax increases to 2.9 percent annually with
exemptions for pension costs, energy expenses and other items,
couldn’t be immediately reached for comment today.
