             Italy’s Finance Ministry will
directly own almost a third of  Enel SpA , the country’s biggest
power company, after swapping part of its 20.3 percent stake in
oil company  Eni SpA  with a state-controlled lender.  
 The board of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA will turn over
17.4 percent of Enel, a stake with a  market value  of 5.7 billion
euros ($7 billion), Rome-based CDP said in an e-mailed statement
today. The Ministry will also receive an indirect stake of 13.8
percent stake in  STMicroelectronics N.V. , currently worth 834
million euros, and 35 percent of Poste Italiane, the country’s
postal service, which doesn’t trade publicly.  
 Italy’s Antitrust Authority had ordered CDP to sell its
stake in Enel after the lender in 2005 bought a 30 percent
holding in  Terna SpA , the electricity grid operator, from Enel.
Enel had been ordered to spin off the grid network to boost
competition in Italy. The lender lost an appeal of that decision
in February 2006.  
 The ministry’s Eni stake is currently worth about 12.4
billion euros, more than the total value of the CDP assets. The
Finance Ministry will appoint an independent adviser in
conjunction with CDP to determine the final amount of Eni shares
to be turned over.  
 CDP already owns 10 percent of Eni. The Treasury owned 13.9
percent of Enel prior to the swap.
