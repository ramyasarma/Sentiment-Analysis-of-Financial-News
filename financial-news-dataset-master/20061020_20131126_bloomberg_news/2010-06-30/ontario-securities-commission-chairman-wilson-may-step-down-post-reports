             Ontario Securities Commission
Chairman  David Wilson  is expected to step down as head of
Canada’s biggest securities regulator when his term expires this
year, the National Post reported.  
 Wilson indicated to the Ontario government that he’s not
interested in renewing his five-year term when it expires in
November and a search is under way for candidates to replace
him, the  Post  said today, citing unidentified people familiar
with the situation.  
 The Ontario Securities Commission declined to comment and a
Ministry of Finance spokesman said no decision has been made on
Wilson’s term, the newspaper said.
