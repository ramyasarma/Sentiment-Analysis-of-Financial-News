             Maoist rebels killed 26 security
personnel in an ambush in India’s eastern state of Chhattisgarh,
the third major attack on security forces in the region since
April, the Central Reserve Police Force said.  
 Rebel forces opened fire from a hilltop on security
personnel returning from a foot patrol yesterday, state-run
broadcaster Doordarshan cited Vikram Srivastava, chief of the
CRPF, as saying in the capital, New Delhi.  
 The attack took place in the remote Narayanpur district,
about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Raipur, Doordarshan
reported, citing unidentified security officials.  
 Mineral-rich Chhattisgarh is one of 11 of India’s 28 states
where the rebels, known as Naxalites, are fighting to install
communist rule and take control of resource assets. An attack in
April in Chhattisgarh killed 76 policemen and 31 police
personnel and civilians died in a rebel attack on a bus in May.  
 India banned the Maoist movement and more than a dozen
“front organizations” in June last year. The Naxalites have
killed more than 7,500 people since 1998, according to
government figures.  
 The movement takes its name from a 1967 peasant uprising in
a village called Naxalbari in the eastern state of West Bengal.
The Naxalites have targeted the army, police, industry and
landowners as part of their class war.
