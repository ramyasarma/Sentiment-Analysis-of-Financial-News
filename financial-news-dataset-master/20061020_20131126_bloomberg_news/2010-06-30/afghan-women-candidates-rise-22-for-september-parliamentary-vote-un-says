             The number of Afghan women
candidates for September’s parliamentary elections has risen 22
percent over the tally for the vote five years ago, according to
a United Nations Security Council report released today.  
 The number of women pursuing legislative seats increased to
400 out of 2,635 candidates. That compares with 328 women out of
2,707 candidates in the 2005 elections, the UN said.  
 “This number ensures that, at a minimum, women candidates
will fill all of the 68 allocated seats and are likely to get
additional ones,” the world body said in the study. There are
249 seats in the Afghan National Assembly’s Wolesi Jirga or
House of People, according to the parliament’s  website .  
 While women account for roughly half of the population in
Afghanistan, they are struggling to assert themselves in Afghan
society after years of repression. Women represent only 18
percent of the country’s students in higher education
institutions and 16 percent of those holding government
positions, according to the Afghan  statistics agency .  
 Turkish Ambassador  Ertugrul Apakan , who led a Security
Council visit to Afghanistan last week, told the council he
welcomed the rising participation of women candidates.
