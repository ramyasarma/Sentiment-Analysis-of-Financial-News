             U.S. Army General  David Petraeus  was
confirmed by the Senate today on a 99-0 vote to be commander of
American and NATO forces in Afghanistan as President  Barack Obama  steps up an offensive against Taliban insurgents.  
 Petraeus replaces General  Stanley McChrystal , who was
removed from the war command by Obama last week for disparaging
comments about the administration made in a Rolling Stone
magazine interview.  
 “The Senate’s quick action and General Petraeus’s
unrivaled experience will ensure we do not miss a beat in our
strategy to break the Taliban’s momentum and build Afghan
capacity” for security efforts in the country, Obama said in a
statement.  
 The Senate vote came a day after Petraeus told his
confirmation hearing that he is concerned the U.S. military’s
rules of engagement in the war are too restrictive and are
putting American forces at risk.  
 “I am keenly aware of concerns by some of our troopers,”
Petraeus told the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said he
discussed the issue with President  Hamid Karzai  and other top
Afghan officials “and they are in full agreement with me.”  
 Petraeus will lead a force of 142,000 U.S. and North
Atlantic Treaty Organization troops who are in the midst of an
offensive to try to push the Taliban out of their stronghold in
Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan.  
 Afghan Security  
 The Obama administration has described its war strategy as
an effort to slow the insurgency while building up the Afghan
government’s capacity to extend security and effective
governance across the country.  
 Petraeus said the Taliban, even with their losses,
“continue to show an ability to adapt and respond” to changes
in tactics by the allies. The 57-year-old general has already
been closely involved in the war as head of U.S. Central
Command, whose area of responsibility includes the Middle East
and Central Asia.  
 Military commanders and top national security officials are
planning to review the progress of the Afghanistan campaign at
the end of the year. Obama has set July 2011 as the target for
the start of a drawdown of U.S. forces if security conditions
permit.  
 “It is going to be a number of years before Afghan forces
can truly handle the security tasks in Afghanistan on their
own,” Petraeus said yesterday. “The commitment to Afghanistan
is necessarily, therefore, an enduring one.”
