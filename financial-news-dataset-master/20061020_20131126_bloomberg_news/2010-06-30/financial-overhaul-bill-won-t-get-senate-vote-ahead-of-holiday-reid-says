             The U.S. Senate won’t vote this week
on legislation to overhaul the nation’s financial regulations,
the chamber’s Democratic leader said today.  
 Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said
that under the chamber’s rules there isn’t enough time to bring
the legislation to a vote before lawmakers leave for a week-long
July 4 recess. “I can’t procedurally get to it,” Reid told
reporters.  
 A House vote on the bill is likely today.
