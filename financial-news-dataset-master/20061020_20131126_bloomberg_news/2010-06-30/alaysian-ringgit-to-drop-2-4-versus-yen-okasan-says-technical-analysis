             Malaysia’s ringgit may weaken 2.4
percent against the yen within a week after today sliding
through its 200-day moving average, a key level in technical
analysis, according to Okasan Securities Co.  
 The Southeast Asian nation’s currency reached 26.529 yen on
May 26, the weakest it’s been since March 5, and may revisit
that level, said  Tsutomu Soma , a bond and currency dealer at
Okasan, citing a series of numbers known as the Fibonacci
sequence. The ringgit slid as much as 1 percent today to 27.038,
below the 200-day moving average of 27.214, and was recently
trading at 27.213, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “The big trend for the ringgit-yen pair may change for the
ringgit to weaken,” Tokyo-based Soma said. “The yen looks
quite bullish across the board and that supports the technical
view over this pair.”  
 The Malaysian currency reached a one-month high of 28.687
yen on June 21, exceeding a 61.8 percent retracement of its
decline from an April 26 high of 29.739, the strongest level
since October 2008, to the May 26 low. The move suggests the
ringgit will return to last month’s weakest level, Soma said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Other significant levels are 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 50
percent, and 76.4 percent.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
