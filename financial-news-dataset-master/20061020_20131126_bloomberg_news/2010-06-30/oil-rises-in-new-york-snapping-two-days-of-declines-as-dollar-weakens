             Oil traded near $76 a barrel in New
York, reversing earlier losses, as a weaker dollar prompts
investors to buy commodities as a hedge against inflation.  
 Crude rebounded as the  Dollar Index , a measure of the
greenback against six major currencies, fell for the first time
in three days on concern U.S. economic growth may falter.  
 “Everyone understands now that it will take more time than
expected for the economy of America to get better,” said Ken
Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives sales manager at broker
Newedge Group in Tokyo.  
 Oil for August delivery was at $76.06 a barrel, up 12 cents,
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:15 p.m. Singapore time.
The contract earlier fell as much as 0.8 percent to $75.33.  
 The dollar declined to $1.2219 per euro at 6:48 a.m. in
London from $1.2188 in New York yesterday, when it touched
$1.2152, the highest level since June 14.  
 Oil is heading for its first quarterly decline since 2008,
losing 9.2 percent since the end of March. Futures have fallen
4.2 percent this year.  
 U.S. crude inventories dropped 3.4 million barrels last
week, according to a report from the industry-funded American
Petroleum Institute.  
 Oil Supplies  
 U.S. stockpiles  probably dropped  1 million barrels in the
week ended June 25 from 365.1 million the prior week, according
to the median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
before tomorrow’s government report. It would be the first
decline in three weeks.  
 Distillate fuel supplies, including diesel and heating oil,
rose 3.9 million barrels to 158.7 million, the API said.
Gasoline stockpiles fell 908,000 barrels to 220.2 million.  
 Oil-supply totals from the API and Energy Department moved
in the same direction 75 percent of the time over the past four
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Crude supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
the New York futures, dropped by 1.9 million barrels to 36
million, the biggest decline since the week of Sept. 11,
according to the API.  
 Brent crude for August delivery was at $75.38 a barrel,
down 6 cents, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at
3:21 p.m. Singapore time. The contract earlier fell as much as
63 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $74.81. It fell $2.15, or 2.8
percent, to $75.44 yesterday.
