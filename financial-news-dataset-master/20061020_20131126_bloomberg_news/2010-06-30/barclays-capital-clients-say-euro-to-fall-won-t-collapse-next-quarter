             The euro is likely to decline,
though is unlikely to collapse, in the third quarter of this
year, according to a survey of Barclays Capital clients.  
 More than 80 percent of respondents said the 16-nation
currency is likely to have a further decline or to be
rangebound, while 4 percent expect a euro rally, Paul Robinson,
a currency strategist at Barclays in London, wrote in a research
note today. Fewer than 10 percent think the euro is likely to
collapse, he said.  
 “Given the prevailing environment, positions are
relatively light: five times as many clients responded that they
are running light positions than both large and at-limit
combined,” Robinson said.  
 The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.2278 as of 12:54 p.m. in
London, paring this year’s decline to 14.3 percent.
