             Coal shipments from Australia’s
Newcastle, the world’s biggest export port for the power station
fuel, rose 3.6 percent last week while the number of vessels
waiting to load reached the longest in almost three years.  
 The volume exported in the week ended 7 a.m. local time
June 23 climbed to 2.11 million metric tons from 2.04 million
tons in the preceding period, Newcastle Port Corp. said on its
website today. Rio Tinto Group, Xstrata Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd.
are among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor.  
 Sixty-one  vessels were outside the harbor, up from 51 a
week earlier. The queue reached the same number in the week
ended July 16, 2007. Coal ships waited to load for an average of
15.17 days, up from 14.67 days, the port said in its report.
That compares with 1.29 days for general-cargo vessels.  
 The 61 vessels includes ships traveling to the harbor to
load coal as well as those queuing off the coast, Newcastle
Port spokesman  Keith Powell  said by telephone today. The figure
includes ships as far north from the port as Papua New Guinea,
he said.  
 The port this month started a new satellite tracking-method
intended to coordinate the arrival of ships, cut waiting
times, reduce costs and improve safety, Powell said. The system
was trialed for 18 months before being implemented, he said.  
 The new system was designed after a 225-meter (738-foot)
bulk carrier, the Pasha Bulker, later renamed the Drake, ran
aground in storms at Nobbys Beach, south of Newcastle harbor in
June 2007, prompting an airlift to rescue 21 crew members.  
 Export Constraints  
 Power-station coal prices at Newcastle, an Asian benchmark,
fell by 3.1 percent, declining for the first week in four,
according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index. Prices dropped to $97.31
a ton from $100.40 in the week to June 25.  
 Coal shipments from Newcastle port are limited by the
capacity of trains to carry the product to the harbor, Goldman
Sachs JBWere Pty analysts led by Melbourne-based  Neil Goodwill 
said in a note dated June 28.  
 Trains on the network will be capable of transporting 123
million metric tons a year in 2012, compared with the 133
million-ton export capability of two terminals operated by Port
Waratah Coal Services, Goldman Sachs said. Capacity on the rail
line will be 145 million tons.  
 Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group, partly owned by BHP
Billiton Ltd., shipped its first cargo from the Australian port
in March after spending more than A$1 billion ($850 million) on
a third terminal at the harbor. Its export capacity is expected
to rise to 30 million tons in 2011.
