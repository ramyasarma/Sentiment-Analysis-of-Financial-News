             South Africa’s trade deficit
unexpectedly narrowed in May as a surge in exports of precious
and semi-precious stones and metals outweighed an increase in
imports of vehicles, aircraft and boats.  
 The deficit of 302 million rand ($39.4 million) followed a
1.9 billion rand shortfall in April, the South African Revenue
Service said in an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate
of 12 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for a 2.5 billion
rand deficit.  
 “It’s a good figure,” said Freddie Mitchell, an economist
at Efficient Group in Pretoria. “Given international
circumstances, the growth in exports is very encouraging.
Exports could have been even higher had there not been a
strike” at the state-owned transport company.  
 Exports rose 6.8 percent to 47.2 billion rand in May from
the previous month, as shipments of precious and semi-precious
stones and metals surged 37 percent, the revenue service said.
Exports of mineral products, including coal, rose 5 percent.  
 Shipments of metals, wine and fruit were partially
disrupted when workers at Transnet Ltd., the port and rail
operator, embarked on a three-week strike on May 10. Several
companies, including Exxaro Resources Ltd., ArcelorMittal South
Africa Ltd., and Xstrata Plc, were forced to declare force
majeure on metal and coal deliveries, enabling them to miss
contracted deliveries.  
 Imports climbed 3.1 percent to 47.5 billion rand, with
purchases of vehicles, aircraft and boats rising 40 percent, and
mineral products increasing 7 percent, the Revenue Service said.  
 The rand traded at 7.6530 per dollar as of 2:57 p.m. in
Johannesburg, down from 7.6363 before the release of the data
and compared with 7.6652 late yesterday.  
 Trade figures are often volatile, reflecting the timing of
shipments of commodities such as oil and diamonds.
