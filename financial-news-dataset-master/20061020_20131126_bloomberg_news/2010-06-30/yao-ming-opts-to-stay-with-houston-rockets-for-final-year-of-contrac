             Yao Ming  will see out the last year
of his contract at the Houston Rockets after sitting out last
season with a foot injury.  
 The 7-foot-6, 310-pound (2.29 meter, 141 kilogram) center
missed Houston’s last campaign after having a bone graft and
other procedures to change the alignment of his foot and reduce
stress on the repaired bone.  
 “To miss one year is a long time,” Yao said in video
comments on the Rockets’ website. “I’ve never been in this
situation before and I’m getting as much information as I can
about my foot, to see what’s the best for me and best for the
Rockets. I decided a couple of days ago.”  
 The 29-year-old said he’s resumed basketball activities and
will be fit when training camp begins.  
 Since entering the National Basketball Association as the
top pick in the 2002 draft, Ming has averaged 19.1 points and
9.3 rebounds per game. He will earn $17.7 million next season,
KRIV-TV in Houston reported. Yao declined to say if he’ll stay
with the Rockets beyond next season.  
 “We’re very excited to have Yao Ming committed to coming
back for next season,” Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey said
in a statement yesterday. “He’s been the foundation of this
team since his arrival in 2002 and we’re looking forward to
having him back on the court.”
