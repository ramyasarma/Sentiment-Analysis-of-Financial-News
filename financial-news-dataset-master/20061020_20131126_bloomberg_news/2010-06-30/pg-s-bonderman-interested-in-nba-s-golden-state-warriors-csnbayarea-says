             David Bonderman , the founder of
private-equity firm TPG Capital, is among those who might be
interested in buying the National Basketball Association’s
Golden State Warriors, CSNBayArea.com reported.  
 Representatives from TPG, without Bonderman, toured Oracle
Arena in Oakland, California, and the team’s training facility
yesterday, the  website said , citing multiple people with
knowledge of the visit.  
 Owen Blicksilver , a spokesman for TPG, declined to comment
in a telephone interview.  
 Other interested buyers include  Oracle Corp . Chief
Executive Officer  Larry Ellison , 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide Inc.,
founder  Mark Mastrov  and  Peter Guber , chief executive officer of
Mandalay Entertainment Group, according to the website. It’s
unknown whether Guber is the primary bidder in the Mandalay
Group, as  Joseph Lacob , a senior partner at venture fund  Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers , also took part in Mandalay’s arena
tour last week, the website said.  
 The franchise, which has been majority owned by former
cable company executive  Christopher Cohan  for 15 years,
announced its plans in March, hiring Galatioto Sports Partners
LLC to handle all aspects of the sale.
