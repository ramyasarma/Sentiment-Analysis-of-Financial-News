             Wind Hellas Telecommunications SA,
the Greek mobile operator that restructured last year, will miss
40.5 million euros ($50 million) of debt payments due in the
next two weeks, according to owner  Naguib Sawiris .  
 Creditors are being asked not to push Wind into default as
it seeks to reorganize borrowings for the second time in seven
months, the Egyptian billionaire said in an interview. The phone
company’s business is being hurt by falling consumer confidence
and spending after the implementation of austerity measures to
ease the Greek budget deficit crisis.  
 More cash may be put into the Athens-based company
“depending on the outcome of negotiations with creditors,”
Sawiris, 56, said in the interview.  
 Wind Hellas faces a 17.5 million-euro payment today on its
250 million-euro revolving-credit facility maturing June 2012,
according to Standard & Poor’s. The company must also make a 23
million-euro coupon payment on 1.2 billion euros of floating-
rate notes due October 2012 on July 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sawiris, who ranked 205th in Forbes magazine’s World’s
Richest People list last year, owns Wind Hellas through his
Weather Investments SpA holding company. He bought the company
from the administrators after it moved its headquarters to
London in August to go through a so-called prepackaged
bankruptcy under U.K. law.  
 Competitive Position  
 “The first restructuring didn’t take out enough debt,”
said  Alex Moss , head of high yield at Insight Investment
Management in London, which oversees the equivalent of $150
billion of assets. “Add in its competitive position in the
Greek market and that demand for its services fell off a cliff,
and this is what you get.”  
 Insight doesn’t hold Wind Hellas bonds, Moss said.  
 Investors holding at least 50 percent of the floating-rate
notes formed a steering committee to promote their interests in
debt negotiations, said four money managers that hold Wind
Hellas bonds. The members of the committee include York Capital
Management LLC, Anchorage Advisors LLC and Mount Kellet Capital
Management LLC, said the investors, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private.  
 Christian Reyntjens , senior managing director at York
Capital in London, declined to comment, as did Anchorage and
Mount Kellet spokesman, who wouldn’t be identified.  
 Wind’s secured floating-rate notes fell 1 cent on the euro
to 29 cents, the lowest ever, according to HSBC Holdings Plc
prices on Bloomberg. Its 356 million euros of unsecured 8.5
percent notes due October 2013 were unchanged at 4 cents on the
euro, also a record low.
