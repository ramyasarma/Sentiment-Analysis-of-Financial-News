             China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,
the nation’s biggest refiner, is expanding its oil refinery in
central China’s Wuhan city and restarting construction of an
ethylene unit at the plant.  
 The refinery’s annual oil processing capacity will rise to
9 million metric tons, or 180,722 barrels a day, from 8 million
tons after the second-phase upgrade is completed, Wang Lijuan, a
media official at the plant, said by telephone from Wuhan today.
The company began construction of its 800,000 metric-ton-a-year
ethylene plant this year after halting work in 2008, Wang said.  
 Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, is enlarging and
upgrading refineries and chemical plants to meet rising demand.
China’s ethylene consumption may rise 4.5 percent a year to 29
million tons by 2015 while production capacity may reach 20
million tons, China Petrochemical Corp. said June 25.  
 Sinopec is also adding downstream fuel processing units to
the refinery, which includes a 1.8 million ton-a-year
hydrocracker, according to Wang. The new refining facilities are
expected to start trial runs in September 2012, she said.  
 The ethylene unit will be completed in 2013, Wang said.
Sinopec had halted construction of the chemical unit in 2008
because of the financial crisis, she said.  
 Beijing-based Sinopec and the government of Wuhan city,
signed an agreement on Dec. 4 to expedite the ethylene project,
parent China Petrochemical said Dec. 7.
