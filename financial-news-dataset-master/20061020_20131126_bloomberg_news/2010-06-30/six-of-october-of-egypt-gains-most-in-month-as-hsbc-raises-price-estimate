             Six of October Development &
Investment Co.  jumped the most in almost a month after HSBC
Holdings Plc increased the price estimate for the Egyptian
luxury property developer.  
 The shares gained 3.7 percent, the most since June 3, to
83.42 Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo, valuing the company
at 3 billion Egyptian pounds ($532 million). The shares have
lost 15 percent this quarter.  
 HSBC raised the price estimate for the company also known
as SODIC 1.4 percent to 145 pounds.  
 SODIC may bid for a plot of land on the outskirts of Cairo
in a government auction next month, the Cairo-based company said
yesterday. The 410 feddan plot (1 feddan = 1.038 acres) is
located in Sheikh Zayed City.  
 Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30 Index  fell for the seventh day, its
longest losing streak in a year. The measure dropped 1.4 percent
to 6,033.09, bringing the slump for the quarter to 11 percent.
