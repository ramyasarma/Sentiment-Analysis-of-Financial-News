             U.S. farmers will sow more soybeans
than ever this year after rains forced them to switch away from
corn, cotton and wheat, which need to be planted earlier, the
Department of Agriculture said.  
 A record 78.868 million acres will be planted with the
oilseed, up 1.8 percent from 77.451 million last year, the USDA
said today in a report based on a survey of farmers. In a survey
in March, growers said they intended to plant 78.098 million
acres. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 78.161
million acres, on average.  
 “The perception in the trade is that the acreage will be
lower yet because wet weather in June prevented farmers from
finishing planting all the acres they intended,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market analyst for AgriVisor LLC in
Bloomington, Illinois. “Still, the final crop size will be
determined by the weather in August,” when soybeans set pods
and fill them with beans, Durchholz said before the report.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery yesterday fell 6.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $9.12 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The most-active futures have dropped 13 percent this
year.  
 Some fields from Nebraska to central Ohio received as much
as four times the normal rainfall the past 30 days, according to
the  High Plains Regional Climate Center  at the University of
Nebraska in Lincoln.  
 Farmer Survey  
 The USDA report is based on a survey of about 88,000
farmers and 11,000 field samples collected during the first two
weeks of June, as the planting season neared completion. As of
June 27, 97 percent of the crop was sown, the USDA said earlier
this week. The department in August will release its first
estimate of soybean production, based on today’s acreage
forecast.  
 Last year, farmers harvested a record 3.359 billion bushels
of soybeans. The average yield was 44 bushels per acre, the most
ever, according to the USDA. The results came after flooding
delayed planting and wet, cool weather in August boosted yields.  
 The USDA also surveyed farmers about the use of genetically
modified seeds. About 93 percent of the total soybean acreage
was planted with gene-engineered seeds this year, up from 91
percent last year, the government said.  
 Soybean stockpiles left over from last year’s harvest
totaled 571 million bushels as of June 1, down 4.2 percent from
596 million a year earlier, the USDA said in a separate report.
That’s the smallest inventory since 2004. Eight analysts in a
Bloomberg survey expected 592 million bushels, on average.  
 “There’s no immediate worry about U.S. soybean supplies,”
after farmers in Brazil and Argentina completed harvesting a
record crop last month, up 37 percent from a year earlier,
Durchholz said.  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued last year
at a record $31.8 billion, according to the USDA. Corn is the
top crop, with a 2008 value of $48.6 billion.
