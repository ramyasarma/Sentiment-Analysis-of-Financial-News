             Pakistan State Oil , the nation’s
biggest fuel retailer, plans to increase its shareholding in
 Pakistan Refinery Ltd.  to take advantage of a planned
deregulation of petroleum pricing.  
 State Oil, which has an 18 percent  share  in the second-
biggest oil processor, is in talks to buy a stake held by the
U.K.’s Shell International Petroleum Co., according to a filing
to the stock exchange today. Shell owns the biggest 30 percent
stake in the refiner, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Pakistan’s may deregulate the pricing of petroleum
products, allowing refiners to set rates instead of the Oil &
Gas Regulatory Authority, a state-run agency. A government panel
is scheduled to meet on July 8 to review a proposal by the
petroleum ministry.  
 “It is a strategic move by Pakistan State Oil to get a
majority shareholding in the refinery since it will strengthen
the company,” said  Muhammad Rehan Khan , head of research at
First Capital Equities Ltd., in Karachi.  
 Pakistan Refinery  rose 3.7 percent to 78.57 rupees at the
3:30 p.m. close on the Karachi Stock Exchange, its steepest
climb in almost a month. Pakistan State Oil  fell  0.8 percent to
261 rupees.  
 “Pakistan State Oil and Shell have confirmed that the
discussions are preliminary and exploratory,” according to the
filing.
