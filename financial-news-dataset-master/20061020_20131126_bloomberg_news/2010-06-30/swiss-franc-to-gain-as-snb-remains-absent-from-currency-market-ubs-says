             The Swiss franc may extend gains
against the euro beyond 1.30 as financial turmoil boosts demand
for the currency as a haven and the central bank refrains from
selling it, according to UBS AG.  
 A lack of central bank sales mean the franc “may have to
overshoot to a level that would start to be detrimental” to the
economy, and the medium-term risks to UBS’s three-month target
of 1.35 are “very much on the downside,”  Beat Siegenthale r, a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at UBS in Zurich, wrote in a
client note today. SNB analysts would “not be surprised to see
the pair dropping below 1.30,” he wrote.  
 The franc weakened 0.5 percent against the euro to 1.3254
as of 3:29 p.m. in Zurich. It traded at 1.3166 yesterday, the
strongest level since the euro’s 1999 debut.  
 Switzerland’s currency has gained 3.9 percent against the
common European currency since June 17 when the central bank
said after its quarterly meeting in Geneva that deflationary
risks have “largely disappeared.”
