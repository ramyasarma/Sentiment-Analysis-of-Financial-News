             The pound dropped from its highest
level in 18 months against the euro and government bonds rose as
a policy maker said spending cuts may cause the economy to sink
back into recession.  
 Sterling dropped against most of its major counterparts
including the dollar as a report showed Britain’s consumer
confidence fell to the lowest level in six months. Bank of
England policy maker  Adam Posen  said the U.K.’s economy is
“tentatively” recovering. The pound has advanced 8.8 percent
against the euro in the second quarter.  
 “The fundamentals in the U.K. are still weak,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd. in London. “Our concern is that the pound’s recent
strength may increase the risk of a double-dip scenario.”  
 The pound depreciated 1.6 percent to 82.23 pence per euro
at 5:15 p.m. in London, from 80.91 yesterday, when it reached
80.68, the strongest level since November 2008. Sterling fell
0.8 percent to $1.4945. The pound slid 0.9 percent to 132.33
yen, from 133.49.  
 Sterling has declined 1.6 percent against its major global
counterparts this year, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indices.  
 An index of the U.K.’s consumer sentiment fell to minus 19
from minus 18 in May, the market researcher GfK NOP said in an
e-mailed statement today in London. A measure of consumers’
optimism on the economy over the next 12 months dropped to minus
12 from minus 8.  
 ‘Different Outcomes’  
 “With the strong recovery outside of western Europe
proceeding on one side, and the coming austerity at home and in
the euro area on the other, I think the U.K. is still poised
between two very different outcomes,” Posen said in a speech in
London today. “That leaves the U.K. economy tentatively in the
recovery state, but still subject to switching back into the
recession state.”  
 The euro rose today against most of its major counterparts,
as the European Central Bank said it will lend banks 131.9
billion euros ($161.5 billion) for three months, less than some
economists forecast and a sign that the region’s financial
industry may be stronger than investors estimated.  
 The 10-year gilt yield fell to as low as 3.33 percent
before paring the decline to stand two basis points lower at
3.37 percent. The 4.75 percent security maturing in March 2020
rose 0.13, or 1.3 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 111.36.
Two-year note yields fell three basis points to 0.75 percent.  
 Gilt Returns  
 Gilts have gained 4.2 percent this quarter, compared with a
similar return for German bonds, according to indexes compiled
by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  
 U.K. gilts may be benefitting from being outside the euro
region as investors seek a refuge from European debt turmoil,
said  Robert Stheeman , chief executive officer of the U.K.’s Debt
Management Office.  
 Government bonds are still “highly sought after,
especially at the time of increasing volatility,” Stheeman said
in an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s The Pulse. “For
the U.K., there is perhaps an argument to say that we may be
regarded as being slightly outside the euro zone, and therefore
benefitting.”
