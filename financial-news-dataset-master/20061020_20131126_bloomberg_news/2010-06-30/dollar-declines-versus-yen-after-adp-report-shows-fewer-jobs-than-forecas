             The dollar fell against the yen,
reversing earlier gains, after ADP Employer Services said the
U.S. added 13,000 jobs in June. The ADP figures were forecast to
show a gain of 60,000 jobs in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The yen gained 0.1 percent against the dollar, to 88.53,
after earlier declining as much as 0.2 percent to 88.77.
