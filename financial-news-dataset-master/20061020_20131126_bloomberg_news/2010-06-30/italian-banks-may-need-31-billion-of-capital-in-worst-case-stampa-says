             Stress tests show that  Unicredit
SpA , Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA may
need a total of as much as 25 billion euros ($31 billion) of
fresh capital over the next two years, La Stampa reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The three Italian lenders results are better than the
average of 25 European banks evaluated by a stress test,
according to the Italian newspaper.
