             India’s  current-account  deficit
widened to a record last quarter as an accelerating economy
boosted imports of goods and machinery.  
 The measure of trade and investment flows posted a $13
billion deficit in the three months ended March 31 after a
revised $12.2 billion shortfall in the previous quarter, the
Reserve Bank of India said in an e-mailed statement in Mumbai
today. The median forecast of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a $5.75 billion gap.  
 A widening current-account deficit may weaken the rupee
further, already the worst performer in Asia this quarter after
the Korean won. India’s economy may accelerate to 8.5 percent in
the year ending March 31, according to the finance ministry.  
 “The deficit could expand compared with last year because
we are going to grow faster as the global economy recovers,”
said  Prasanna Ananthasubramaniam , chief economist at ICICI
Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. in Mumbai.  
 The rupee has lost 3.3 percent against the dollar since
April 1 and closed at 46.46 today.  
 Imports rose 43 percent to $83.9 billion in the three
months through March from a year earlier, the Reserve Bank said.
Exports grew 36.2 percent to $52.4 billion in the same period.  
 The South Asian nation imports crude oil to meet three-
quarters of its needs.  
 Inflows from so-called invisibles that include software
 export  earnings and remittances were $18.5 billion last quarter,
less than the $18.9 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31,
according to the statement.  
 India’s capital account showed a surplus of $15.1 billion
in the three months ended March 31 from a $14 billion surplus in
the previous quarter,  the Reserve Bank said .
