             The arrest of Harvard University
professor  Henry Louis Gates Jr . outside his home last year was
“avoidable,” according to a review commissioned by police in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the college is located.  
 The arrest took place on July 16, 2009, when neighbors
mistook Gates, who is black, for a burglar outside his own home.
The incident occurred because both Gates and the police failed
to “ratchet down” the situation peacefully, according to the
 report  from the Cambridge Review Committee released today.  
 Gates is director of Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for
African & African American Research, and his arrest by Sergeant
James Crowley, who is white, spurred widespread outrage and a
national discussion about race and law enforcement that drew
criticism of the police from U.S. President  Barack Obama . The
incident was sparked by “misunderstandings” and the two men’s
“fear of each other,” according to the report.  
 “The incident raises issues that affect policing every day
in cities across the nation,” the report said.  
 Police went to Gates’s home near Harvard’s main campus
after a caller reported two men trying to force their way into
the house, according to an arrest report filed at the time. The
review committee report confirmed that police should have left
Gates in his home after he produced a driver’s license and
Harvard identity card that confirmed the home was his, said
 Charles Ogletree , a Harvard Law School professor who is Gates’s
attorney.  
 Crowley’s Authority  
 “This means the incident was avoidable and suggests that
Sergeant Crowley should have responded in a variety of other
ways,” Ogletree said today in a telephone interview. “It’s
abundantly clear that this police officer with his gun, his
badge and his authority controlled the situation.”  
 After the incident occurred, Obama said that the police
“acted stupidly” in arresting Gates. He later had Crowley and
Gates come to the White House to share a beer and try to close
the controversy.  
 Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas requested the
review last year so that the department and police across the
nation could learn from the incident. The review, led by Chuck
Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research
Forum, concludes with 10 recommendations for de-escalating
conflicts, including working with communities and campus police
departments more closely.
