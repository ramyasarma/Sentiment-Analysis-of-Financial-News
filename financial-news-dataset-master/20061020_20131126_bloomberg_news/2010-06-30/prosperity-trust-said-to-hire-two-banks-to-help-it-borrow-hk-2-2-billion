             Prosperity Real Estate Investment
Trust , the Hong Kong fund controlled by billionaire  Li Ka-shing ,
hired Standard Chartered Plc and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
to help it borrow HK$2.2 billion ($283 million), according to a
person familiar with the matter.  
 The five-year facility, which is being syndicated to other
banks, is split between a HK$1.77 billion term loan and a HK$430
million revolving loan, the person said, asking not to be
identified as the details are private.  
 Lenders contributing HK$250 million or more will receive an
all-in fee of 113 basis points more than the  Hong Kong interbank
offered rate , the person said. Money raised will be used to
refinance a HK$1.9 billion loan maturing this year, they said.  
 Prosperity REIT media relations manager Jan Wong wasn’t
available for comment when called at the company’s head office
in Hong Kong.  
 In a revolving credit facility money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
