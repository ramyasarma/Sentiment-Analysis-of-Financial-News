             U.S. farmers sowed 87.872 million
acres (35.6 million hectares) with corn, less than expected and
below a prior government forecast as below-average temperatures
and wet weather in May interfered with field work.  
 In a March survey, growers indicated they would plant
88.789 million acres. The average estimate of 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 89.252 million acres. A year ago,
86.482 million acres were planted, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report.  
 “Planting got off to a rapid start in 2010 due to
favorable conditions” in April, the USDA said in its report.
“However, below-average temperatures and wet weather dominated
much of the Midwest and portions of the Plains during the middle
part of May, hampering the planting of the remaining acreage.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery yesterday fell 8.75
cents, or 2.5 percent, to $3.44 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has dropped for seven straight sessions and is
down 17 percent this year.  
 Today’s report is based on a survey of 88,000 farmers and
11,000 field samples during the first two weeks of June, after
almost the entire crop had been planted.  
 The USDA also polled farmers on their use of genetically
modified seeds. About 86 percent of the total corn acreage was
planted with gene-engineered seeds, up from 85 percent last
year.  
 Grain Stockpiles  
 Corn inventories remaining from last year’s record harvest
totaled 4.31 billion bushels as of June 1, the USDA said in a
quarterly report on grain stockpiles.  
 That’s up 1.1 percent from 4.261 billion bushels a year
earlier and the most since 1988, the department said. Analysts
expected 4.624 billion bushels, on average. The USDA estimate is
based on the farmer survey, plus responses from 9,000 commercial
grain facilities.  
 Most of this year’s crop will be harvested from late
September to late October. Farmers may finish about three weeks
earlier than last year when wet, cold weather interfered with
field work and delayed plant maturation.  
 The USDA on June 10 estimated this year’s crop productivity
at 163.5 bushels an acre, down 0.7 percent from 2009’s record of
164.7 bushels.  
 “If corn yields rise near 170 bushels, there will be a
large inventory,” Basse said. “Early planting and abundant
rains in June suggest rising yield potential,” said Basse who
is forecasting a national yield of 167.8 bushels.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show. The U.S. is the world’s largest
producer and exporter.
