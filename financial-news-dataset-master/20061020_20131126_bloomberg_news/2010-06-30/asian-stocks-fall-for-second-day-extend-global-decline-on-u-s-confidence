             Asian stocks fell for a second day,
extending a global rout, as a slump in U.S. consumer confidence
fueled concerns about the strength of the global economy.   
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.4 percent to 112.37 as
of 9:07 a.m. in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 2
percent, while South Korea’s Kospi declined 1.9 percent.
