             Illinois Attorney General  Lisa Madigan  filed a lawsuit against  Bank of America Corp. ’s
Countrywide unit claiming the company discriminated against
black and Latino borrowers.  
 The mortgage lender steered minority borrowers into risky
subprime mortgages more than it did white borrowers who were
similarly situated, Madigan said today in a statement. Minority
borrowers also paid more than other borrowers for all
Countrywide mortgages, including its prime loans, Madigan said.  
 “Countrywide’s illegal discriminatory lending practices
destroyed the wealth and dreams of thousands of African American
and Latino homeowners,” Madigan said in the statement. “Bank
of America needs to be held accountable by taking financial
responsibility for cleaning up the devastation of the predatory
company that it chose to take over.”  
 Shirley Norton , a spokeswoman for  Bank of America , didn’t
immediately return an e-mail or a call to her office after
regular business hours.  
 The case is the People of the State of Illinois v.
Countrywide, 10CH27929, Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery
Division.
