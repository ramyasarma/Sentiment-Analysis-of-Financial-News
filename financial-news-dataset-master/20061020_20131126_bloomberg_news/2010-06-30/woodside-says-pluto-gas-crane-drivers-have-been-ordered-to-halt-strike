             Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s
second biggest oil and gas producer, said the national labor
tribunal ordered a halt to strike action that is threatening
delays at its A$13 billion ($11 billion) Pluto gas project.  
 Fair Work Australia suspended the “protected industrial
action” by a dozen crane drivers and forklift operators seeking
pay increases, Woodside said in a statement yesterday. The
workers began striking on April 28, affecting work by mechanical
and electrical contractors, the company said June 23.  
 First liquefied natural gas exports from Pluto are forecast
to start by the end of March 2011, within market guidance, after
the immediate return to work of the crane drivers and forklift
operators, Perth-based Woodside said. Workers at the site in
Karratha, about 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) north of Perth,
ended an eight-day strike over accommodation in January.  
 Mammoet, employer of the crane drivers and forklift
operators, and the Construction, Forestry and Forest Products,
Mining and Energy Union are obliged to continue “good-faith”
wage negotiations under the legislation, Woodside said.  
 Woodside put in place a plan to fulfill commitments to
customers should strikes delay the Pluto venture, one of more
than a dozen proposed LNG projects aimed at tapping rising Asian
demand for cleaner-burning fuels,  the gas producer  said in
February. Costs to build the project would jump by as much as
A$1.1 billion, partly because of higher labor expenses, Woodside
said in November.
