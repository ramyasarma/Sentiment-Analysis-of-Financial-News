Yashili International Holdings Ltd.,
which produces milk products in China, is seeking as much as
$398 million in an initial public offering in Hong Kong,
according to terms for the transaction.  Yashili, one of three Chinese dairy companies planning
initial stock sales in Hong Kong, is offering 644 million shares
at HK$3.55 to HK$4.80 apiece, the terms show.  Bank of America
Corp. ’s Merrill Lynch unit and  UBS AG  are managing the sale.  The company plans to set the price of its shares on Oct. 25
and to start trading on Nov. 1 with the ticker 1230, according
to the terms. Of the stock being offered, 89.1 percent is new
shares and 10.9 percent is existing equity, the terms show.  Yashili operates dairy plants in Guangdong, Heilongjiang,
Shanxi and Henan provinces and employs more than 5,000 workers,
according to its  website . Investor interest in dairy stocks may
be reviving after shares of  China Mengniu Dairy Co.  and rivals
plunged in 2008 because of melamine contamination of milk
products in China.  Modern Farming (Group) Co. , which operates dairy farms, is
seeking to raise about $300 million and list in Hong Kong next
month, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
Global Dairy Holdings Ltd., a Chinese milk-product company,
plans to raise as much as $242 million in an IPO and list in
Hong Kong on Oct. 28, according to terms for the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
