Burundi’s annual economic growth
rate is expected to stabilize at 5 percent between 2013 and 2015
as the East African country rebuilds after a civil war, the
International Monetary Fund said.  The economy may expand 3.9 percent in 2010, from 3.5
percent last year, the Washington-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement late yesterday. Growth may accelerate to 4.5
percent and 4.8 percent in 2011 and 2012 respectively, it said.  Economic growth may be driven by improved management of the
coffee industry and rising foreign aid inflows to build
infrastructure, according to the statement. Growth will hinge on
continued political stability and progress on implementing a
common market pact within the East African Community, of which
Burundi is a member.  Coffee sales account for two-thirds of Burundi’s exports
and the industry is the main source of income for about 800,000
households in one of the world’s poorest nations, the IMF said.  Burundi’s average inflation rate is expected to drop to 5
percent by the end of 2013 and stay at that level through 2015,
from 9.5 percent at the end of this year, the statement said.  Burundi, a nation of 8 million people, is recovering from a
15-year civil war in which 300,000 people died. The conflict
ended with a peace agreement in 2008. Fighting began in 1993
when soldiers from the ethnic Tutsi minority assassinated the
leader of the main party of the Hutu majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
