China’s  stock rally  may falter as
the Shanghai Composite Index faces “risk” at the 3,000-level,
according to Chart Partners Group Ltd.  “Looking forward over a medium-term to long-term horizon,
China must break above and stay above 3,000 in order to turn the
macro cycle bullish,” said  Thomas Schroeder , managing director
at Chart Partners in Bangkok. “Otherwise this rally is simply a
range move that would fail under 3,000.”  The Shanghai Composite, which tracks the larger of the
nation’s stock exchanges, rose 1.4 percent to 2,902.072 at 10:17
a.m. local time, having climbed 23 percent from its July 5 low.
The  gauge  has jumped 9.7 percent since the end of a weeklong
holiday this month and on Oct. 12 crossed its 200-day moving
average. The measure may decline later this week, returning
below the indicator, according to Schroeder.  “Price action very often fluctuates above and below such
levels,” Schroeder wrote in an e-mailed response to questions
by Bloomberg News. “The real test comes from sustained action
above the 200-day moving average. More than likely, we will see
the sharp rise stall very soon.”  Schroeder is more cautious than Schaeffer’s Investment
Research, who said this week the break above the 200-day moving
average is a “positive sign” that signals further gains for
the Shanghai Composite. Technical analysts at Nomura Holdings
Inc. and CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. also said this week the index
may extend gains after surpassing resistance levels.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
