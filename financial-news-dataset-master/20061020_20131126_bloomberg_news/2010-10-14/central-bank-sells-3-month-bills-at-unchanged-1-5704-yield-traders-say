The People’s Bank of China sold
three-month bills at a yield of 1.5704 percent in open-market
operations, unchanged for the 14th straight sale, according to
traders at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and
China Citic Bank Corp.  The monetary authority, which offered 31 billion yuan ($4.7
billion) of the 91-day notes, has let the yield rise at six
previous auctions this year. The rate last climbed four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.5704 percent on June 10.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
