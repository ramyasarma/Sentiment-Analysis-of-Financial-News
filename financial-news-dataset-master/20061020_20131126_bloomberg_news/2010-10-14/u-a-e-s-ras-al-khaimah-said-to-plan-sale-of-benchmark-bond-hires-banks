Ras Al Khaimah, one of the seven
sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates, plans to sell
a so-called benchmark bond and has hired two banks to manage the
transaction, two bankers familiar with the plan said.  Citigroup Inc.  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  will
manage the sale, said the Dubai-based bankers, who declined to
be identified because the information is private. A benchmark-
sized bond usually raises at least $500 million.  Ras Al Khaimah last sold a bond in July 2009, when it
raised $400 million from an Islamic ijarah sukuk, Bloomberg data
shows. A spokesman for Ras Al Khaimah could not immediately be
reached for comment. A spokesman for Citigroup declined to
comment as did a spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Scotland.  Gulf Arab issuers have raised $4.48 billion from bond sales
in the past month as bond markets eased, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Dubai, the U.A.E.’s second-biggest
emirate, raised $1.25 billion in a two-part bond sale in
September in its first sovereign debt issue since the Dubai
World credit crisis roiled global markets.  Dubai Electricity & Water Authority is expected to raise $2
billion today from the sale of 6- and 10-year notes, according
to a person familiar with the transaction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
