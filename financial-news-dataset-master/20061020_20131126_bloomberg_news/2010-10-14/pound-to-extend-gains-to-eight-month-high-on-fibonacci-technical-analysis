The pound may extend gains to an
eight-month high of $1.6340 after it rose above major resistance
between $1.5969 and $1.6018, according to Forecast Pte, citing
trading patterns.  The $1.5969 level is 61.8 percent retracement of the U.K.
currency’s fall from the November high to the May low, based on
a series of numbers known as the Fibonacci sequence. The $1.6018
level is the Oct. 7 high, while $1.6340 represents resistance on
a descending trend line that connects the highs of November 2009
and August this year, said  Pak Lai Ng , a technical analyst at
Forecast.  “Sterling is in an uptrend and will head toward that trend
line,” said Singapore-based  Ng  in an interview. “Everything is
still positive.”  The pound traded at $1.6004 as of 7:57 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.6010 in New York yesterday, when it climbed to $1.6067, the
strongest since Feb. 3. The $1.6340 level was last seen on Jan.
20, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Daily momentum indicators such as the moving average
convergence/divergence, or MACD, also show the U.K. currency is
set to extend the past month’s 2.8 percent rally, Ng said.  The pound’s MACD was 0.0101 today, above the signal line of
0.0092, based on Bloomberg data. The MACD is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-
day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is
plotted on top of the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an area where
sell orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
