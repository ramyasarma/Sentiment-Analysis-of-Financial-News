Mobile Telecommunications Co. , the
Kuwaiti phone operator in talks to sell a 46 percent stake to
Etisalat, has paid the majority of its debts and wants to
restructure the remainder, Chief Operating Officer  Barrak al- Sabeeh  said.  “We have paid off most of our debts, what remains is a
small amount with high interest,” al-Sabeeh told reporters late
yesterday. “We want to restructure these debts with lower
interest.”  Mobile Telecommunications, known as Zain, said last month
it was considering options for a revolving credit facility of
$1.5 billion to refinance existing debts at lower rates. “We
are talking to banks,” al-Sabeeh said Oct. 11 when asked about
the credit line. “It’s a facility whereby we can use it once we
need it.”  Kuwait’s Kharafi Group, Zain’s second-largest shareholder,
is leading the sale of a 46 percent stake in Zain to Etisalat,
as  Emirates Telecommunications Corp.  is known. Etisalat is
offering 1.7 dinars ($6) a share.  Zain Group has no intention of selling its Sudan operations
now, Chief Executive Officer  Nabeel Bin Salamah  told reporters
yesterday when asked if Zain would sell the Sudan unit before
the planned deal with Etisalat.  Zain posted a fivefold rise in profit for the first nine
months of the year to 976 million dinars ($3.46 billion) as it
added customers and after a gain from selling most of its
African operations in June to  Bharti Airtel Ltd.  for $9 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
