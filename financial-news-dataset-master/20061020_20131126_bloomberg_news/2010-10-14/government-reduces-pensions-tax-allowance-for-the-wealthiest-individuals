Britain plans to reduce the amount
of pension savings that can benefit from tax relief, a move that
will hit wealthy individuals and raise 4 billion pounds ($6.4
billion) a year to help cut the record  budget deficit .  The government will cut the annual allowance to 50,000
pounds from 255,000 pounds, starting in April 2011, and lower
the lifetime limit to 1.5 million pounds from 1.8 million pounds
in 2012, the Treasury said today. The lifetime allowance applies
to the value of the pension rather than the amount paid into it.  “We have developed a solution that will help to tackle the
deficit but not hit those on low and moderate incomes,”
Treasury Minister  Mark Hoban  said in a statement posted on the
Treasury’s website.  The announcement comes less than a week before Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is due to detail 83 billion
pounds of spending cuts to balance the government books by 2015.
Osborne angered supporters last week by pledging to scrap child-
benefit welfare payments to the wealthiest households from 2013.  The government had considered setting the annual pension-
saving allowance as low as 30,000 pounds. The 50,000-pound limit
means fewer people on lower incomes will be affected, the
Treasury said. The measure will affect 100,000 people, of whom
80 percent earn more than 100,000 pounds a year.  ‘Rightly Heeded’  “Today’s announcement is not as bad as feared,” said John
Cridland, deputy director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry, the U.K.’s biggest employers’ group. The
coalition government “rightly heeded warnings about the impact
that restrictive regimes can have on pension saving.”  The new limits replace proposals drawn up by the previous
Labour government under which people earning more than 150,000
pounds a year would have had the tax relief they received
gradually reduced to 20 percent while paying income tax at the
top 50 percent rate.  Those plans provoked criticism from the pensions industry,
with the CBI today describing them as “simply unworkable.”  “Without doubt, the new proposals are a lot simpler to
deal with for people earning over 150,000 pounds a year compared
to the system previously proposed,”  Patrick Stevens , a tax
partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP, said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
