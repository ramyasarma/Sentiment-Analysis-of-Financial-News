Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said China should release Nobel Peace Prize laureate  Liu Xiaobo ,
risking a further rift as he seeks to repair bilateral ties
damaged by a territorial dispute.  “It would be desirable for him to be released,” Kan said
in parliament today in response to a question. Kan added that he
was watching to see whether Liu, a democracy activist who was
sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 on charges of
subversion, and his wife will be allowed to attend the award
ceremony in Oslo in December.  Japan is attempting to arrange a summit with Chinese
Premier  Wen Jiabao  at this month’s meeting of Asian leaders in
Hanoi. The two men met in Brussels at an Asia-Europe summit on
Oct. 4 and pledged to mend ties frayed by rival claims to
uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.  “We are hoping to use the opportunity for a Japan-China
summit” at the meeting hosted by the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  told
reporters today in Tokyo. “Nothing has been decided.”  Kan also told parliament that relations between Asia’s two
biggest economies are improving, and Sengoku said Japan won’t
formally ask for Liu’s release. China criticized the Nobel award
as undeserved and inappropriate for someone who is in prison for
violating Chinese laws.  To contact the reporters on this story:
