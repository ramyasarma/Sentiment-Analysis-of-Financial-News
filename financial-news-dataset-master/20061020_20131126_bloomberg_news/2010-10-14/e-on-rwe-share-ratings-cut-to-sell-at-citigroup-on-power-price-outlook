E.ON AG and RWE AG, Germany’s
biggest utilities, were downgraded at Citigroup Inc., which said
“absent a strong rise in power prices, we therefore struggle to
see a scenario under which E.ON and RWE can outperform the
broader market.”  The brokerage downgraded E.ON to “sell” from “buy,”
while cutting its recommendation on RWE to “sell” from
“hold.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
