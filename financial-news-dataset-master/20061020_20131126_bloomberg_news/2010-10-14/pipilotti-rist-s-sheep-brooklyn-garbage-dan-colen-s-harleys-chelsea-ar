In a darkened gallery, images of
grazing sheep and rotating circles stream slowly onto rows of
undulating scrims. The viewers meander through as if in a
trance.  Swiss artist  Pipilotti Rist  is back in town with a
spellbinding video installation “Layers Mama Layers” at
 Luhring Augustine  gallery.  Projected from the opposite sides of the room, furry
animals and deliriously green pastures appear simultaneously on
multiple textile screens.  The magic continues in the back, where Rist transforms
underwear into a mesmerizing 10-tier chandelier. Hanging side by
side, the panties, bloomers and trunks glow softly from within.  On a recent afternoon, the gallery was filled with babies,
hipsters and retirees, all cooing with delight. Last year,
almost 400,000 people saw Rist’s videos of rotten fruit, pig
snouts and auburn-haired maidens at the Museum of Modern Art.  “Massachusetts Chandelier” (2010) is $275,000; “Layers
Mama Layers” (2010) is $350,000. The show runs through Oct. 16
at 531 W. 24th St.; +1-212-206-9055;

Jackson’s exhibition at  Peter Blum  gallery in Chelsea.  Large and heavy, his sculptures and panels tackle loaded
subjects such as life, death, scientific feats and their
disastrous effects.  Jackson, who was born in 1974, draws inspiration from the
major 20th-century discoveries and uses the latest technology,
including solar panels. The results are mixed.  The artist reconstructs the cockpit of the “Enola Gay,” the
B-29 that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, from colorful
bits of Ikea furniture and ceiling tiles. The cheerful 8-by-9-
foot jigsaw puzzle conveys not an iota of the terror its title
alludes to.  Jackson is more successful with “August 6, 1945,” which
refers to the day Hiroshima burned, but shows a map of Hamburg,
the German city that was leveled during World War II. You feel
the dread of annihilation emanating from the scorched, black
surface made of collaged bits of wood and lead.  Since his last exhibition at Peter Blum in 2008, Jackson
has become an art-market prodigy with a 601,250 pounds
($955,807) auction record.  He seems ambivalent about the new status, embracing it in
“Study Collection VI,” a 19-foot-long stainless-steel shelf
displaying skulls and mock organs in a homage to  Damien Hirst ’s
medicine cabinets. “Me, Dead at 36,” a 7-foot-tall C-print
depicting a body bag has a more sinister message.  Prices range from $16,000 to $275,000. “In Search of”
runs through Nov. 13 at 526 W. 29th St.; +1-212-244-6055;
 http://peterblumgallery.com   Brooklyn Garbage  Brightly colored and delicate, Nathan Carter’s mobiles and
stage sets at the  Casey Kaplan  gallery are delightfully low-
tech. The 40-year-old artist makes them by hand from discarded
“street treasures.” He finds them all over Brooklyn where he
lives and works.  These include: a broken purple plastic cigarette lighter;
three Kronenbourg beer caps; a cage made from flattened
champagne cork-wire.  Alexander Calder  instantly comes to mind and it is not
accidental. The artist is currently participating in “Alexander
Calder and Contemporary Art: Form, Balance, Joy” at the Museum
of Contemporary Art in Chicago.  Prices range from $12,000 to $35,000. “Pocket Shrapnel
Set-Ups Veronica Vex and Brooklyn Street Treasures” runs
through Oct. 23 at 525 W. 21st St.; +1-212-645-7335;
 http://www.caseykaplangallery.com   Toppled Motorcycles  An unlimited budget is bad news for undercooked ideas and
“Dan Colen: Poetry” at  Gagosian  gallery is the latest case in
point. The much-hyped artist filled the mega-quarters of
Gagosian’s West 24th Street outpost with a red-brick wall, 13
toppled motorcycles, a skate-board ramp turned upside-down and
large-scale paintings made with loads of chewing gum.  The relationship between the objects is anyone’s guess. To
Colen, it’s about “how powerful a single simple gesture can
be,” according to the press release. Except that there aren’t
any simple gestures here, only extremely laborious and costly
ones.  Colen’s interpretation of Pollock’s drip paintings results
in nasty-textured gum squiggles on white canvases. Despite their
scale, the works hang limply, empty of tension or presence. Each
would set you back by as much as $250,000.  The sculptural pieces replicate things that exist in real
life. The Harley Davidson bikes look like ... a bunch of Harley
Davidson bikes, a trite riff on a Duchampian ready-made.  Building full-size hogs for the sake of a reproduction
feels grossly extravagant and dated, the gesture of more
prosperous times.  “Dan Colen: Poetry” runs through Oct. 16 at 555 W. 24th
