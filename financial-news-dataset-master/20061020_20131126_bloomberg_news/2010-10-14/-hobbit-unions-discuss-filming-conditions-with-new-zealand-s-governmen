Labor unions threatening to boycott
“The Hobbit” movie met with New Zealand’s economic development
minister to discuss conditions for the country’s film industry.  Minister  Gerry Brownlee  met with representatives from the
 Screen Production and Development Association ,  New Zealand
Actors’ Equity  and the  Council of Trade Unions  for “a useful
and productive discussion,” he said in a  statement  today. The
talks “will help to ensure New Zealand remains an attractive
screen production environment,” Brownlee said.  Actors unions have threatened to boycott the $150 million
two-part film of J.R.R. Tolkien’s book if producers didn’t
provide union contracts. Prime Minister  John Key  offered to
resolve the standoff on Oct. 4 amid fears the film would be
moved overseas.  The three films based on Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings”
fantasy epic had generated almost $3 billion in worldwide box-
office receipts and another $3 billion from DVDs, merchandise
and other sources, Warner Bros. said last year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
