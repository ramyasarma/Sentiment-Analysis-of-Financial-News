Gap Inc. , the San Francisco-based
operator of more than 3,000 clothing stores, expects most of its
sales growth to come from outside North America and online,
Chief Executive Officer  Glenn Murphy  said today.  The company will be able to sell products in 80 countries
by the end of 2010, an increase from 25 at the start of the
year, according to a statement. This expansion includes the
first stores in Italy and China.  Online sales will double to $2 billion by no later than
2014, said  Toby Lenk , who runs that business. The retailer also
said it plans to avoid television advertising this holiday
season for the Gap brand, unlike last year, to focus on the Web
and mobile.  Sales at U.S. retailers have grown for 13 straight months
as consumers emerge from the worst recession since the 1930s.
The slump has led some customers to watch their wallets,
prompting more of them to seek discounts as they begin shopping
for the holidays.  Gap, which also operates the Banana Republic chain, rose 7
cents to $19.06 at 11:09 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading . The shares had fallen 9.4 percent this year
before today.  Revenue  from outside North American and the Web will make
up one-quarter of total sales by 2013, Gap said, compared with
21 percent in the most recent quarter. The company also is
exploring whether to open Old Navy stores outside North America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
