Gold climbed to a record for a
second day as a weaker dollar spurred demand for an alternative
investment. Silver futures extended a rally to a 30-year high.  The greenback dropped to the lowest level in 10 months
against a basket of six major currencies on bets that the
Federal Reserve will buy more debt to sustain the economic
recovery. Asian central banks may continue to increase gold
reserves, said the Bank of Nova Scotia.  “There is a distrust of currencies, and gold is the only
solution,” said  Bernard Sin , the head of currency and metal
trading at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA in Geneva. “A lot of
money is going into precious metals,” and there’s demand from
India because of the country’s festival season, he said.  Gold futures for December delivery added $7.10, or 0.5
percent, to close at $1,377.60 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, after reaching an all-time high of $1,388.10.
The previous record was $1,375.70.  Gold, up 26 percent this year, is heading for its 10th
consecutive annual gain. The metal rallied as central banks and
governments maintained low borrowing costs and spent trillions
of dollars to stimulate economies.  On Oct. 4, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said that the
central bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases aided
the economy and that further buying is likely to help more. He
is scheduled to speak about monetary policy in Boston tomorrow.  ‘Currency Hedge’  “Markets continued to price in a second round of U.S.
quantitative easing, which is expected to pressure the U.S.
dollar and support gold as a currency hedge,”  Mark Pervan , a
senior commodity strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., wrote in a report today.  Bullion for immediate delivery touched a record $1,387.35
in London today.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 50.30 cents,
or 2.1 percent, to $24.435 an ounce in New York. Earlier, the
price reached $24.95, the highest level since March 1980.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained $5.20, or 0.3
percent, to $1,712.60. Palladium futures for December delivery
jumped $7.90, or 1.3 percent, to $601.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
