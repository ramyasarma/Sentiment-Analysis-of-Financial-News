Copper in London and New York
climbed to the highest levels in 27 months as a weaker dollar
boosted demand for commodities as alternative investments.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.9 percent to $8,437 a metric ton, the
highest level since July 2008, before trading at $8,436 a ton by
8:18 a.m. Singapore time. Copper in London reached a record
$8,940 a ton on July 2, 2008.  December-delivery copper on the Comex in New York gained as
much as 0.6 percent to $3.8445 a pound, also the highest level
since July 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
