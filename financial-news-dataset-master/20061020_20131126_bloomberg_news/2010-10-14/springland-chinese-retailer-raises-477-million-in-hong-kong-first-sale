Springland International Holdings
Ltd. , an operator of department stores and supermarkets in
China, raised about HK$3.7 billion ($477 million) selling shares
at the top of the forecast range in an initial public offering
in Hong Kong, according to terms for the transaction.  The company sold 625 million shares at HK$5.93 apiece in
the sale managed by Morgan Stanley, the terms e-mailed to
investors today show. The retailer, based in Wuxi city of
eastern Jiangsu province, offered its shares at HK$4.85 to
HK$5.93 each, according to the terms.  Springland operates 10 department stores and 16
supermarkets in and near the Yangtze River Delta in eastern
China, according to a pre-listing filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Some of the department stores are operated under the
trade name of “Yaohan,” the filing showed.  Proceeds from the IPO may help Springland add stores to
compete with rivals including  Intime Department Store (Group)
Co.  and  Parkson Retail Group Ltd.  in an economy that passed
Japan in the second quarter to become the world’s second
biggest. Retail sales in China surged 18.4 percent in August,
according to government data, exceeding analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
