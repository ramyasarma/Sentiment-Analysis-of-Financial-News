third day of gains. Gold climbed as much as 1.3 percent to a

it jumped as much as 1.8 percent to 728.98 rand, its best

planning consent from the London Borough of Hammersmith & Fulham
to redevelop the Olympia Exhibition and Conference Centre.  Clicks Group Ltd.  (CLS SJ), a South African retailer of
toiletries, music and pharmaceuticals, rose 54 cents, or 1.2

succeeding Keith Warbuton, from February.  Coal of Africa Ltd.  (CZA SJ), the Australian miner of the
fossil fuel, climbed 32 cents, or 3.3 percent, to 10 rand. A

few weeks to approve the restart of operations at its  Vele
project  in the country’s Limpopo province.  Metropolitan Holdings Ltd.  (MET SJ), a South African
insurer, rallied for a second day, rising 11 cents, or 0.7
