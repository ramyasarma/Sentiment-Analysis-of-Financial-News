Japan’s competition regulator is
“concerned” a planned iron ore joint venture between  Rio Tinto
Group  and  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s second- and third-
largest exporters, may limit competition.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission  notified the two mining
companies of its concern over a possible violation of
antimonopoly laws on Sept. 27, Wataru Kobayashi, director of the
commission’s merger and acquisition division, said today by
phone. The regulator will make a final decision after hearing
responses from the companies, Kobayashi said, without specifying
the timing.  Rio Tinto, based in London, said Oct. 6 that regulators had
signaled they may object the iron ore venture with BHP. The two
companies agreed in June 2009 to combine mines, railroads and
ports in Australia’s Pilbara region in a 50-50 venture. The
venture, initially due to be completed by mid-2010, has been
delayed as regulators from Australia to Europe study the plan.  The FTC, which extended its review of the plan on July 16,
hasn’t received additional documents requested from the mining
companies, Kobayashi said.  Steelmakers in Japan, the world’s second-largest producer,
have opposed the plan to combine iron ore operations, saying it
would limit competition. The accord should be blocked by
regulators, the World Steel Association said when the deal was
announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
