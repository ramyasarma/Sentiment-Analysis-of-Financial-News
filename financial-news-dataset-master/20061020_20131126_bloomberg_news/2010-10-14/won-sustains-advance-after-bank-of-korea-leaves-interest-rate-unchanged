South Korea’s won sustained today’s
advance after the central bank held off from raising interest
rates at a policy meeting today, a decision forecast by six of
10 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The currency was 0.7 percent stronger at 1,113.14 per
dollar as of 10:27 a.m. in Seoul, having traded at about
1,114.50 before the Bank of Korea announced its seven-day
repurchase rate will stay at 2.25 percent. A quarter of a
percentage point increase was forecast by four economists in the
Bloomberg survey.   To contact the reporter on this story:
