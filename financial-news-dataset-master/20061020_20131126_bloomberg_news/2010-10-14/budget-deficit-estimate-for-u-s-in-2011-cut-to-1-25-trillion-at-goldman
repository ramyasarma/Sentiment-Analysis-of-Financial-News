Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists
reduced their forecast for the  U.S. budget  deficit to $1.25
trillion in the current fiscal year.  The economists previously anticipated a gap of $1.3
trillion before revising that after the Congressional Budget
Office calculated a  shortfall  of $1.29 trillion in the previous
fiscal year which ended last month.  “As the CBO is rarely off by more than a few billion
dollars in its monthly reckoning, we take this figure as given
in making a provisional adjustment to our forecast for full-year
2011 budget balance,” the economists said in a report to
clients late yesterday.  The new forecasts mean the U.S. government can issue less
debt in coming months, the economists said. Goldman Sachs’ chief
U.S. economist  Jan Hatzius  wrote in a separate note this week
that he expects the U.S. economy to be “fairly bad” over the
next six to nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
