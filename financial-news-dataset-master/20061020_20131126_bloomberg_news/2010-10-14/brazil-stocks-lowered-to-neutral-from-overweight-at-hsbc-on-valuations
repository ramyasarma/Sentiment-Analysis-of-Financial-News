Brazil’s  stocks  were lowered to
“neutral” from “overweight” at HSBC Holdings Plc, which said
other emerging markets offer more “compelling” valuations.  Brazilian equities will still benefit from domestic and
Chinese growth as well as gaining commodities,  Alexandre Gartner 
and Francisco Machado, analysts at HSBC in Sao Paulo, wrote in a
note to clients dated yesterday.  Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa  index trades at 15.5 times the
reported earnings of its companies, compared to a ratio of 15.1
for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
