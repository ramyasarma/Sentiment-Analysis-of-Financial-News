U.S. stock-index futures erased
gains after initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased and
wholesale costs rose at a pace that suggests limited demand is
restraining inflation.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December fell 0.2 percent to 1,172 at 9:07 a.m. in New York
after rising as much as 0.6 percent earlier. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures slipped 13 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 11,031.  Jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 462,000 in the week ended
Oct. 9, the Labor Department said today in Washington. The total
number of people on unemployment insurance rolls decreased to
the lowest level since November 2008, while those getting
extended benefits declined.  The so-called core producer price index, which excludes
food and energy, increased 0.1 percent last month, Labor
Department figures showed. Including volatile food and energy
costs, wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent, exceeding the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Apollo Group Inc. tumbled 20 percent to $39.80 after the
for-profit education company withdrew its 2011 earnings
forecast.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
