European Union carbon-dioxide
allowances for December pared losses after the Netherlands
canceled an auction on the Climex exchange.  EU allowances for December were down 4 cents at 15.59 euros
($21.95) a metric ton as of 11:08 a.m. on London’s European
Climate Exchange. They earlier traded as low as 15.46 euros.  Contracts for delivery tomorrow fell 0.3 percent to 15.54
euros a ton. The Dutch government had planned to sell 2 million
permits today via Utrecht, Netherlands-based Climex. The auction
result was due at 10:15 a.m. London time.  The Dutch government canceled the sale “because
information on orders in the Auction Book was available in the
market,” Climex said in an e-mail. “Further information on
when the 2 million EUAs will be auctioned will be provided at a
later stage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
