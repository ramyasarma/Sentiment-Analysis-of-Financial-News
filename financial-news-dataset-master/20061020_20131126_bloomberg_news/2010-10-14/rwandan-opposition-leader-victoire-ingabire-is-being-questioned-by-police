Rwandan opposition leader Victoire
Ingabire was arrested over allegations she is linked to rebel
activities, police said.  Today’s arrest is the result of an investigation into Peter
Uwumuremyi, a former commander of the rebel Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Rwanda, the police spokesman, Eric
Kayiranga, said in a telephone interview. Uwumuremyi was
arrested yesterday on charges of buying and distributing arms
and ammunition to a group associated with Ingabire’s party, the
spokesman said.  “Both Major Uwumuremyi and Ingabire are being held at the
Kicukiro police station,” he said.  Ingabire was being questioned at Rwanda’s criminal
investigation unit, a spokeswoman for her United Democratic
Forces party said in an interview before police announced the
arrest. The spokeswoman declined to be identified in line with
party policy.  Ingabire returned to Rwanda in January after being in exile
for 16 years. She was arrested in April over allegations she
associated with a terrorist group and propagated genocide
ideology, and was freed on bail.  The opposition leader said her party had been blocked from
registering to field candidates in August’s presidential
elections, which were won by incumbent  Paul Kagame .  To contact the reporters on this story:
