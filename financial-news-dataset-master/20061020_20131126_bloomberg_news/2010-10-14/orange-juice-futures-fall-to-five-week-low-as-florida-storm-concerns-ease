Orange-juice futures dropped to a
five-week low as concerns eased that storms will damage groves
in Florida, the world’s second-biggest citrus grower.  Tropical Storm Paula is weakening as it moves along the
western Cuban coast, according to a National Hurricane Center
advisory. Earlier, Paula was downgraded from a hurricane.
Florida’s orange crop this year is forecast to be 9.3 percent
larger than last season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
on Oct. 8. The commodity has slumped 8.2 percent this week.  “We’re seeing some weather premium coming out of the
market,” said  Fain Shaffer , the president of Infinity Trading
Corp., a commodity brokerage in Medford, Oregon. “Until we get
into frost season, there’s not a whole lot of reason to buy
orange juice.”  Orange juice for December delivery fell 7.3 cents, or 4.9
percent, to settle at $1.411 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price dropped to $1.409, the
lowest level for a most-active contract since Sept. 9.  Paula is “not really a threat at all,” said Kyle Tapley,
a meteorologist at Rockville, Maryland-based MDA EarthSat.
“It’s going to move away from Florida.”  The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and ends Nov.
30.  “We’re coming into a flat period for orange juice for
another 30 to 45 days,” Shaffer of Infinity Trading said. Crop-
damaging frosts may begin in mid-November, he said.  Brazil is the largest orange grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
