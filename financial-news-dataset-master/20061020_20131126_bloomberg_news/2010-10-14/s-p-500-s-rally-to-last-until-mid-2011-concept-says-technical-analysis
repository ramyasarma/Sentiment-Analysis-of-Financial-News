U.S. stocks have rallied to the
highest levels since the May 6 crash, and the advance may last
through the middle of 2011, according to Concept Capital Inc.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  exceeded 1,173.57 intraday
yesterday, topping the post-crash peak reached on May 13 that
marks a “significant bullish development,” said  Craig Peskin  and
 John Kolovos , co-heads of technical analysis research at Concept
Capital. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  first surpassed its
May 13 level on Sept. 30.  The S&P 500 fell on three of the first five days of
October. When U.S. stocks drop at the beginning of this month,
it usually leads to a rally lasting into the subsequent year,
according to Concept, which cited trading patterns going back to
1961. The market also does best at this stage of a U.S.
president’s term, two years before the next election, they said.  “The strength that typically starts during midterm
Octobers usually runs into the summer of a pre-election year,”
the note said. “Pre-election years are the strongest of the
four-year presidential cycle.”  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,178.10 yesterday,
climbing for a fourth straight day. Strategists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the stock index will end the year at 1,208,
according to the average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
