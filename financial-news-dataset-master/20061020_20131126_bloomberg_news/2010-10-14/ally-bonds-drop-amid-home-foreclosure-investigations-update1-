Ally Financial Inc.  debt declined
amid concern that spreading investigations into paperwork
related to home foreclosures threaten to push losses back onto
lenders.  The company’s $2 billion of 8 percent bonds due in November
2031 dropped 3.75 cents to 109.5 cents on the dollar as of 12:47
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “In the past, they have had documentation issues and were
cited specifically with regards to their mortgage servicing
operations,” said  Timothy Daileader , director of research at
financial-services firm Knight Capital Group Inc. in Greenwich,
Connecticut.  Ally’s Residential Capital LLC unit, the parent of GMAC
Mortgage, manages $380 billion of loans.  “We are working through our review process and making good
progress,” said  Gina Proia , a spokeswoman for Ally Financial.
“We have not found any evidence to date of inappropriate
foreclosures.”  Ally, formerly the finance arm of General Motors Co.,
changed its name in May.  Bank of America Corp.’s  $3 billion of 5.625 percent notes
due in July 2020 fell 1.8 cents to 103.95 cents on the dollar as
of 12:55 p.m. in New York, Trace data show. The debt has
declined five straight days. The company, the largest U.S.
lender, extended a freeze on home foreclosures to all 50 states
as concern spread among government officials that homes are
being seized based on false data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
