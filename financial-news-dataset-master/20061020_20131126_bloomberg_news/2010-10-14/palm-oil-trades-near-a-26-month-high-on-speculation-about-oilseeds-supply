Palm oil, little changed, may gain
on speculation that a decline in supplies of rival oilseeds may
boost demand.  December-delivery palm oil rose as much as 1.4 percent to
2,970 ringgit ($962) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest for a most-active contract since Aug. 1,
2008, before trading at 2,927 ringgit at 4:13 p.m. Prices are
heading for a seventh weekly gain, the longest rally since May
8, 2009.  “Crude palm oil should continue to be strong and might
look to test the 3,000-ringgit level,”  Arhnue Tan , a senior
analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn., said in an e-mail. “News on
the soybean shortage could continue to be a driver for prices.”  Palm oil hasn’t traded at more than 3,000 ringgit since
July 31, 2008. It may rally to 3,020 ringgit after “the most
important technical breakout since December 2008,” said Ker
Chung Yang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.  “From the current level, the psychological 3,020 level was
established as the next resistance,” Ker said in an e-mail. If
it trades higher than that level “the next hurdle is detected
at the 3,330 level.”  Palm oil has traded at a 26-month high since the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said on Oct. 8 that the country’s
soybean output will be 3.408 billion bushels (93 million tons),
less than the 3.483 billion projected in September.  Palm oil is the world’s most-consumed edible oil and is
typically used as a substitute when supplies of other oilseeds
shrink. Soybean oil competes with palm oil for use in food.  ‘Stronger Exports’  ECM Libra’s Tan raised her forecast for average palm oil
prices in 2011 to 2,650 ringgit a ton, from an earlier estimate
of 2,500 ringgit.  The USDA’s downgrade of its soybean crop forecast, coupled
with possible supply disruptions caused by La Nina rains, also
prompted CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. analyst  Ivy Ng  to raise on
Oct. 11 her palm oil forecast for this year by 9 percent to an
average 2,630 ringgit a ton. Futures have averaged 2,545 ringgit
this year, according to Bloomberg calculations.  “Stronger exports driven by new demand from Pakistan and
Egypt as well as demand from the U.S. and EU” comes amid
“weak” production, ECM Libra’s report said.  Output in Malaysia, the second-largest producer, dropped
2.7 percent to 1.56 million tons in September, the country’s
Palm Oil Board said Oct. 11. Stockpiles were little changed at
1.71 million tons, while exports surged 21 percent to 1.47
million tons as major festivals in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan
and China boosted demand during the month, the board said.  DBS Forecasts  October production is forecast to be higher than September,
when the number of working days was reduced because of religious
holidays. This “may not be sufficient to take the industry
through the upcoming festive season and the first quarter 2011
cyclical downturn in production,” ECM Libra said.  Palm oil output  in Malaysia this year may be lower than
forecast because of a labor shortage and drought earlier in the
year, HwangDBS Vickers Research Sdn. said on Oct. 12, indicating
it may also revise its price forecasts soon.  HwangDBS cut its full-year Malaysian production estimate to
17.2 million tons from 17.7 million tons. The Malaysian Palm Oil
Board pared its forecast to 17.6 million tons on Oct. 10, little
changed from last year’s production of 17.56 million tons.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, which is
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark price, gained as much as 0.3
percent to $949.50 a ton, the highest since the contract began
trading in May. It was $946.25 at 3:51 p.m. Kuala Lumpur time.  Palm oil on the Dalian Commodity Exchange for May delivery
surged as 1.1 percent to 8,302 yuan ($1,249) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
