The Philippines filed a 24.5 billion
peso ($567 million) smuggling complaint against the local unit
of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , saying it was shifting its drive
against tax evasion “to a much higher gear.”  Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.  evaded 2.72 billion pesos
of excise and value-added taxes by misdeclaring and
misclassifying 52 shipments from 2005 to 2009, the Bureau of
Customs said in a statement. It said it was seeking the maximum
fine of 800 percent, or 21.8 billion pesos, on top of this.  The  bureau  filed the complaint with the Department of
Justice, which will conduct an investigation before filing any
case in court. Shell spokesman  Roberto Kanapi  said he had just
learned of the filing and couldn’t immediately comment.  Shell, one of two oil refiners in the Philippines, is the
biggest company included in President  Benigno Aquino  drive
against tax evasion and corruption. The tax and customs bureaus
have filed complaints with the justice department every week
starting in July, after Aquino took office vowing to fight
poverty by battling corruption. The justice department hasn’t
completed its investigation of any of the complaints.  The government says it loses as much as 250 billion pesos a
year to tax evasion. It forecasts this year’s budget deficit
will widen to a record 325 billion pesos. The budget was already
in  deficit  for 21 of the last 25 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
