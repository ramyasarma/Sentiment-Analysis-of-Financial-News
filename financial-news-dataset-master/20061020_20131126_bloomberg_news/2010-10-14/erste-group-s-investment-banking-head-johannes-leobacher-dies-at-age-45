Johannes Leobacher , Erste Group
Bank AG’s head of investment banking, died today. He was 45
years old.  “All employees of Erste Group feel a deep grief and would
like to extend their heartfelt condolences to his wife and two
daughters,” Vienna-based Erste said in a statement today.  The banker, born 1964 in Salzburg, was appointed head of
investment banking, large cooperates and real estate in April
2009, where he succeeded Johannes Kinsky, who died of a heart
attack in June 2008.   Leobacher, who studied economics and business
administration, joined GiroCredit Bank AG in 1990. After the
bank was merged with Erste in 1997, he held a number of
managerial positions including head of the capital markets unit
for 10 years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
