Brazil’s real declined from a two-
year high after an unexpected increase in U.S. initial jobless
claims signaled the recovery in the world’s largest economy is
faltering.  The real decreased 0.2 percent to 1.6566 per dollar at
10:05 a.m. New York time, from 1.6530 yesterday. The real
earlier touched 1.6442, the strongest level since Sept. 2, 2008.  “I think this is just a reaction to the U.S. data and
fears of a more subdued global recovery,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an
economist with Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. “I don’t think
it’s going to last. I think we’ll see a move back towards
stronger levels in the real, given that the prevailing market
outlook is supportive of a stronger real on a fundamental basis
and on a yield-dynamic basis.”  Jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 462,000 in the week ended
Oct. 9, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
Economists forecast claims would total 445,000, according to the
median of 47 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 11.29 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
