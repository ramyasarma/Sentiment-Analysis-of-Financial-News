Treasury 30-year bonds gained for
the first time in a week on speculation a rally in the yen to a
15-year high will increase Japanese demand for U.S. debt.  Government securities also gained as the Federal Reserve
prepared to  buy  $32 billion of Treasuries in the month ahead as
part of its plan to keep borrowing costs low, with the next
purchases scheduled for tomorrow. The government plans to sell
$13 billion of 30-year bonds today.  “The yen rally means the Japanese economy is going to get
weaker, and it leads people to buy bonds,” said Kazuaki Oh’e, a
debt salesman in Tokyo at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
the nation’s fifth-largest lender.  The 30-year yield declined two basis points 3.80 percent as
of 6:55 a.m. in London, according to BGCantor Market Data. The
3.875 percent security due in August 2040 rose 11/32, or $3.44
per $1,000 face amount, to 101 9/32.  The yen gained to 81.14 per dollar, the strongest since
April 1995, threatening to curb demand for Japanese exports.  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.82 percent in
pre-auction  trading , the same as the auction yield the last time
the securities were sold on Sept. 9.  Investors  bid  for 2.73 times the amount of debt on offer
last month, versus an average of 2.70 for the past 10 sales.
Indirect  bidders , the investor group that includes foreign
central banks, bought 36.1 percent of the securities, versus the
10-auction average of 35.8 percent.  The sale is the last of three auctions this week totaling
$66 billion.  Price Reports  Ten- and 30-year  Treasuries  erased losses yesterday after
the Fed said it would purchase about $32 billion in U.S. debt
over the next month.  “The buybacks were announced and were larger than people
expected, which has led to some buying,” said  Thomas L. di Galoma , head of U.S. rates trading at Guggenheim Capital Markets
LLC, a New-York based brokerage for institutional investors.  Government reports today and tomorrow will show U.S.
inflation was in check last month, economists said.  P rices paid to producers  gained 0.1 percent, slowing from
0.4 percent in August, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists before the Labor Department
issues the number today.  A separate report from the department tomorrow will show
consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in September after a 0.3
percent gain the prior month, the surveys show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
