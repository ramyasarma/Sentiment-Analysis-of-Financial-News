Banco Popolare Scrl should boost
capital by giving new shares to employees, UGL-Credito labor
union head Massimo Bernetti said in an interview.  The union is “cautious” about possible asset sales to
strengthen capital, Bernetti said. Selling a stake to employees
would also give them more say in the bank’s decisions, he said.
A possible solution would be to transform employees’ accrued
severance pay into shares, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
