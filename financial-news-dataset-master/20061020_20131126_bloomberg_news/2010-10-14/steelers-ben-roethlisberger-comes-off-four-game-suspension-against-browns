Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback
 Ben Roethlisberger  will make his 2010 National Football
League debut when he comes off a four-game suspension to
play against the Cleveland Browns on Oct. 17.  Without Roethlisberger, the Steelers are 3-1 this
season with wins over the Atlanta Falcons, Tennessee Titans
and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  “I’m excited, but I’m not to the peak of my
excitement yet, that will probably come later,”
Roethlisberger told ESPN. “I’m anxious, excited, a lot of
emotions. But, like I said, a lot of it is under wraps
right now because we’re focusing on practice.”  Roethlisberger, 28, was suspended by Commissioner
 Roger Goodell  for a violation of the NFL’s personal conduct
policy after being accused of sexually assaulting two
women. Roethlisberger denied the accusations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
