American International Group  is
likely to gain “tens of millions of dollars” from the initial
public offering of a Chinese automaker that does business with
Iran, the South China Morning Post reported.  AIG, through a unit, owns 13.5 percent in Chongqing-based
Lifan Industry Group Co., which exports motorcycles to Iran and
where a local factory has a licensing agreement to assemble
Lifan’s cars from imported kits, the Hong Kong-based English-
language newspaper reported today, citing  Mark Herr , AIG’s New
York-based vice-president of media relations.  Herr said the investment in Lifan wasn’t in violation in
U.S. law and an unidentified U.S. Treasury Department spokesman
said the matter didn’t appear to violate U.S. sanctions, the
Post said. The China Securities Regulatory Commission will hold
an preliminary hearing on Lifan’s IPO application today, it
said.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
