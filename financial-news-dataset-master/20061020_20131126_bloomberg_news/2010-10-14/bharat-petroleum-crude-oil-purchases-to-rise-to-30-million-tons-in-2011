Bharat Petroleum Corp. , India’s
second-biggest state refiner, will start a new plant in January,
boosting its crude requirements to about 30 million metric tons
(600,000 barrels a day) in 2011, a company official said.  The Mumbai-based company may boost purchases of sour crudes,
which currently make up about half its supplies, because the 6
million-ton  Bina  refinery in central India has the ability to
process such grades, said R.K. Singh, director of refineries.
For every 8 barrels of crude bought in term contracts, the
refiner may source 2 barrels from the spot market, he said.  Energy consumption in India is expected to more than double
to 833 million tons of oil equivalent by 2030, according to the
International Energy Agency. The South Asian nation, which
bought 159.3 million tons of crude from overseas in the year
ended March, may surpass Japan as the world’s third-biggest oil
importer as early as 2012.  “Bina is configured to use sour crude and has the
flexibility to use any kind of crude oil,” Singh said. “We
will be processing more sour but the ratio of term and spot will
remain unchanged.”  Saudi Arabia  will continue to be Bharat Petroleum’s biggest
crude supplier and may boost sales next year when the Bina plant
achieves full output, Singh said. The company imports about
250,000 tons from Iran.  “The sanctions on Iran has led to a halt of oil product
exports to Iran but small quantities of crude oil imports have
not yet been affected,” Singh said. “I can’t say about the
future, though.” The company secures about 1.2 million tons of
sweet crudes on term contracts from Algeria, some from Libya and
250,000 tons from Malaysia.  Crude Gains  Crude oil has risen 5.5 percent this year in New York and
November futures were at $83.81 a barrel in electronic trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:41 p.m. Singapore time.  Bharat Petroleum plans to spend 200 billion rupees ($4.5
billion) to expand its oil processing capacity by almost 50
percent, Finance Director S.K. Joshi said in September. Bina’s
capacity may be more than doubled to 15 million tons a year at a
cost of 90 billion rupees, while the Kochi refinery may be
boosted by 63 percent to 15.5 million tons, Joshi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
