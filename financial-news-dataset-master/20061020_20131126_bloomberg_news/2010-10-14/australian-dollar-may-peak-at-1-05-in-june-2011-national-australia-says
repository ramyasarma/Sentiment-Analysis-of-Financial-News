The Australian currency may peak at
$1.05 and remain above parity against the greenback until
September 2011 as the Federal Reserve holds down interest rates,
National Australia Bank Ltd. said in a note to clients.  The so-called Aussie touched 99.82 U.S. cents, the
strongest since foreign-exchange controls ended in 1983, before
trading at 99.65 cents as of 2:50 p.m. in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
