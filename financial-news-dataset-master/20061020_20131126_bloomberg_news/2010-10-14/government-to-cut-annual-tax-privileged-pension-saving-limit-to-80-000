U.K. Treasury Minister Mark Hoban
said the coalition government will reduce the tax-privileged
pension saving limit to 50,000 pounds ($80,000) a year from
255,000 pounds, raising about 4 billion pounds a year to help
cut the record budget deficit.  The lifetime allowance will be reduced to 1.5 milliion
pounds from 1.8 million pounds, Hoban said in a statement posted
today on the Treasury’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
