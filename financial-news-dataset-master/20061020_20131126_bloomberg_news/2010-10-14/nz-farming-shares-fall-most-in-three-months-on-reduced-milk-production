NZ Farming Systems Uruguay Ltd. ,
which operates dairy farms in South America, fell the most in
more than three months in Wellington trading after saying milk
production will be less than the company expected.  Milk volumes were 10 percent less than the company’s budget
in the first quarter and are likely to remain so for the rest of
the year, Chief Executive Officer  Alastair de Raadt  told the
annual meeting in Auckland today. NZ Farming shares fell 6.3
percent, the biggest decline since July 1.  Milk production has been curbed by unusually wet and cold
August and September weather, and slow pasture growth, de Raadt
said. Full-year milk volume is expected to be 90 million liters,
down from the budgeted 100 million liters, he said. Notes of his
speech were sent to the New Zealand stock exchange.  NZ Farming  shares  dropped four cents to 59 New Zealand cents
at the 5 p.m. market close in Wellington.  To contact the reporter for this story:
