Cia. de Concessoes Rodoviarias ,
Brazil’s biggest toll-road operator, fell the most in a year in
Sao Paulo trading amid speculation Brisa-Auto Estradas de
Portugal SA sold a stake.  CCR plunged 6.7 percent to 46.32 reais at 11:23 a.m. New
York time and earlier lost as much as 7.6 percent, the most
intraday since Oct. 20 last year.  Brisa said last month it would sell its 16 percent stake in
CCR by the end of the year, with 6 percent sold to other CCR
holders and the rest in a private placement to be carried out by
Banco Santander SA. Santander today made an order to sell 15.1
million CCR shares at 43 reais each to a separate bank client,
according to a statement from the  BM&FBovespa SA  exchange.
Investors are speculating that Brisa is selling shares, said
 Rosangela Ribeiro , an analyst at SLW Corretora.  “It may be the exit of a big investor,” Ribeiro said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “The market hadn’t been pricing in the
sale, though people knew that Brisa could get out.”  A Brisa press officer in Lisbon didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. A press officer at an outside
public-relations firm representing CCR in Sao Paulo declined to
comment, asking not to be named because of company policy.  Santander’s order today accounts for 3.4 percent of the
total outstanding shares, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
