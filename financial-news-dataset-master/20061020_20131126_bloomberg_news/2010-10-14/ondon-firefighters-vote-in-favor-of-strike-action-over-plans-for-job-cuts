London firefighters have voted in
favor of strike action over plans to cut jobs.  They voted by 3,482 to 943 to take industrial action on as
yet undisclosed dates, according to a Fire Brigades Union
statement today. The turnout for the vote was 79 percent.  “This is a huge vote for strike action,” Matt Wrack, FBU
general secretary, said in the statement. “This vote
demonstrates that London firefighters will fight these mass
sackings every step of the way.”  The strike will be abandoned if Ron Dobson, London’s Fire
Brigade Commissioner, withdraws a letter which began the legal
process of cutting some of the 5,557 uniformed and 41 non-
operational firefighters, the FBU said in the statement.  AssetCo Plc , a private company, will fight fires in London
armed with 27 fire engines if the FBU goes ahead with its
strike. Dates of the strike are due to announced within the next
24 hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
