What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as a weaker dollar boosts
demand for commodities as alternative assets and enhances the
appeal of U.S. supplies for overseas buyers, said  Charles Sernatinger , a vice president for ABN Amro Clearing LLC in
Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as a slumping dollar helps to boost U.S. exports,
Sernatinger said.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 14 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as demand increases from U.S. producers of animal
feed and cooking oil, Sernatinger said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $3 to $3.50 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
