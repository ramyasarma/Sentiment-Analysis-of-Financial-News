French state-owned bank Caisse des
Depots et Consignations has reached an agreement in principle to
take a 26 percent stake in La Poste, Finance Minister Christine
Lagarde told La Tribune in an interview.  The accord would value La Poste at an initial 4.3 billion
euros, which could rise to 5 billion euros depending on
performance, Lagarde told the newspaper. CDC will appoint three
La Poste board members, she added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
