Galp Energia SGPS SA , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, said production increased in the third
quarter from the same period last year after it started
developing the Tupi project in Brazil.  Average working production climbed 37 percent to 19,600
barrels a day, while average net entitlement output rose 7.1
percent from a year earlier to 9,500 barrels a day, Lisbon-based
Galp said today in a regulatory filing. The company processed
5.2 percent more crude, while the volume of its refined-product
sales fell 1.5 percent.  Natural-gas sales volumes added 0.7 percent from a year
earlier to 1.302 billion cubic meters.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as Brazil’s
offshore Santos Basin, where the Tupi project is located, and
Angola to improve access to crude supplies and rely less on
refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and Spain. Its refining
business suffered after the global recession curbed demand for
oil products last year.  The Rotterdam cracking refining margin, a measure of profit
from turning a barrel of crude into fuels, widened to $0.70 a
barrel in the third quarter from $0.50 a year earlier. Galp’s
 refinery  in Oporto can process about 90,000 barrels a day, while
the Sines site has a 220,000-barrel-a-day capacity.  Brazil, Angola  The Portuguese oil company plans to invest from 4 billion
to 4.5 billion euros ($6.3 billion) through 2014 to develop
projects including the Tupi field and refinery conversions that
will increase diesel output and improve profit margins.  Galp aims to increase oil production 10-fold in 12 years to
150,000 barrels a day. In Angola, Galp is investing in the
Tombua-Landana project, where output will peak at 100,000
barrels a day by 2011, according to a Feb. 25 presentation.  The company has stakes in four offshore blocks in Brazil’s
Santos Basin, including the Tupi, Iara and Jupiter finds.
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil’s state-controlled oil company,
estimated in November 2007 that Tupi may contain as many as 8
billion barrels of oil, the largest find in the Americas since
Mexico’s Cantarell field in 1976.  Galp  shares have climbed 12 percent so far this year,
giving the company a market value of 11.2 billion euros.  Eni
SpA , Italy’s biggest oil company, and Portuguese holding company
Amorim Energia BV each control a third of Galp.  Galp is due to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
