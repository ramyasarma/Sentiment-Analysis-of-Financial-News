Kenya Petroleum Refineries Ltd., the
fuel processor owned by  Essar Energy Plc  and the Kenyan
government, plans to raise fees by as much as 42 percent next
year, said General Manager John Mruttu.  The cost of processing a barrel of oil will increase to
$1.35 from $0.95 in January, while fuel-loading fees will
increase by 33 percent to $6 a barrel in April, Mruttu said in a
phone interview today from the Kenyan port city of Mombasa.
Fuel-marketing companies in the East African nation have been
sent a three-month notice of the planned increase, as required
by the regulator, he said.  KPRL is raising fees to cover its operational costs and
finance repairs to its facilities, Mruttu said. Ageing equipment
at the refinery is contributing to fuel shortages, he said.  KenolKobil Ltd. ,  Total Kenya Ltd. , a unit of Paris-based
Total SA, and Kenya Shell Ltd., a division of  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc , are among fuel-marketing companies that operate in Kenya.
All licensed importers in the country are required by law to
process 1.6 million metric tons of crude at the Kenyan refinery
to meet 50 percent of the country’s refined-fuel needs.  Calls to the mobile phone of  Charles Njogu , a spokesman for
KenolKobil, weren’t answered and he didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mailed request for comment. Total Kenya Managing
Director  Alexis Vovk  was in a meeting, an assistant who declined
to be identified, said by phone, and questions e-mailed to his
office weren’t immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
