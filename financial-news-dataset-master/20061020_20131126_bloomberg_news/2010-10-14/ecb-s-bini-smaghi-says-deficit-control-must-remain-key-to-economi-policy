European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said that deficit control must
remain central to economic policy in the euro region and that
governments that control their finances are more popular with
voters.  “The process of fiscal consolidation has to remain the
cornerstone of economic policy” he said at a conference in
Rome. “It has to be also the basis of a radical change in the
way our societies function to ensure that growth is restored.”  One of the biggest risks to the recovery from the global
financial crisis would be to assume that the downturn was
cyclical rather than structural, he said. European government
must still carry out structural reforms to make their economies
more efficient, he said.  “If we fall into this illusion, we may be delluding
ourselves into thinking that traditional policies, monetary and
fiscal policies, are per se able to restore growth to the pre-
crisis level,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
