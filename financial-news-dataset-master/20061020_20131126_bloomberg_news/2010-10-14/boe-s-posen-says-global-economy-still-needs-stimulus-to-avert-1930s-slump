The global economy needs more
monetary stimulus and restraint in deficit reduction to avert a
repeat of mistakes made by European policy makers in the 1930s,
Bank of England policy maker  Adam Posen  said.  Monetary policy that doesn’t do enough to stimulate the
economy risks provoking low growth and deflation if governments
at the same time execute strict spending cuts, Posen said in a
commentary published in  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  The German economy has responded well to an external demand
shock and the following revival of global demand, Posen said.
“Long-overdue” wage increases for workers in Germany are the
best contribution to a solution of Germany’s economic problems
and also help internationally, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
