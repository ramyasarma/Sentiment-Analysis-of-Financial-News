(Corrects figure in headline.)  Hochschild Mining Plc , Peru’s
second-largest silver producer, will raise C$392.4 million ($392
million) selling shares in Lake Shore Gold Corp. to fund
exploration.  Hochschild agreed to sell 109 million shares at C$3.60
each, the Lima-based company said in a statement today. It will
retain about 6 percent of the Canadian gold miner. The company
said last month its investment in Toronto-based Lake Shore and
30 percent holding in Gold Resource Corp. would boost output as
it focused on exploring for new silver projects.  “Today’s transaction demonstrates our focus on value
creation through organic growth and will provide the funds to
progress our strategy of securing and developing early stage,
highly value accretive projects,”  Ignacio Bustamante ,
Hochschild’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Lake Shore said in a separate statement that RBC Capital
Markets, BMO Capital Markets and CIBC World Markets will buy the
shares and sell them in an offering set to close on or about
Nov. 3. Lake Shore, developing gold mines in Canada, is
targeting output of 65,000 ounces of gold this year and plans to
have three mines in full production by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
