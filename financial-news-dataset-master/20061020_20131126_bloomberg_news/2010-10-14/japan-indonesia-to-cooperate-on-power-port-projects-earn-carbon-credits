Japan and Indonesia will cooperate
on developing power, port and road projects as part of more than
$89 billion of investment in the southeast Asian country,
according to government documents.  Japan will provide funds and advice on coal and geothermal
projects and associated infrastructure for so-called economic
development corridors in Indonesia, according to the documents
circulated at a forum in Tokyo today, attended by government
officials and executives.  Indonesia has identified six economic corridors in Sumatra,
Java and other islands to boost growth and alleviate transport
bottlenecks and power shortages. Japan wants to spur growth by
exporting technologies for more efficient coal power plants,
smart grids and railways as demand for goods and services
declines at home.  Investment in the so-called Eastern Sumatra-Northwest Java
and Northern Java corridors is estimated to reach $89.1 billion,
according to an Indonesian government document.  By developing Indonesian electricity projects, Japan is
aiming to earn carbon credits to offset polluting emissions
blamed for global warming. Japan has pledged to cut emissions of
carbon dioxide by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.  Mitsubishi Corp.  and  Marubeni Corp.  were among companies
selected by Japan’s trade minister on Aug. 2 to conduct
feasibility studies for pollution-cutting projects to earn
carbon credits in Indonesia and other Asian countries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
