Australia may sell a stake in
Medibank Private as the health insurer reported stronger full-
year profit, the Australian Financial Review reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The government may consider listing as much as 70 percent
of the insurer as an alternative to full privatization, the
newspaper said in its Street Talk column, without citing
sources. Medibank reported net income of A$305.1 million in
fiscal 2010, up from A$91.2 million a year earlier, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
