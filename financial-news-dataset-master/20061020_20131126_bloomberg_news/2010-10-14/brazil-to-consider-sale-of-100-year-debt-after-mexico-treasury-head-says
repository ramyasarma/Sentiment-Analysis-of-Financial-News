Brazil may consider selling 100-year
bonds after Mexico succeeded in offering the longest-maturity
debt issued by a Latin American country, Treasury Secretary  Arno Augustin  said.  “As Brazil improves, this possibility, that was hard
before, is starting to be considered,” Augustin said in
Brasilia. “A sale with this profile can be assessed in the
future.”  Mexico sold $1 billion of bonds due in 100 years on Oct. 5,
taking advantage of global demand for higher-yielding debt amid
record-low interest rates in the U.S. and Europe. In Brazil,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  doubled a tax foreigners must pay
to buy domestic debt in a bid to temper dollar inflows.  There may be investor demand for 100-year bonds from Brazil
and other countries, said  Guillermo Osses , who helps oversee
$50 billion in emerging-market assets at Pacific Investment
Management Co.  “It wouldn’t be surprising, given how well this bond has
performed in the market,” Osses, who’s based in Newport Beach,
California, said in an Oct. 6 telephone interview. “Brazil,
for example, could fit very well that type of description.”  Brazil may also sell real-denominated foreign debt before
the end of the year, Augustin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
