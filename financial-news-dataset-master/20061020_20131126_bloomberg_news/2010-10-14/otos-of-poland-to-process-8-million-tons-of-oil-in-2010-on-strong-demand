Grupa Lotos  SA, Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner, will process about 8 million metric tons of
oil this year, some 5 percent more than it had forecast, the
company’s chief operating officer said.  A robust demand for fuels is prompting the expected
increase,  Marek Sokolowski  said today, in an interview on the
sidelines of the World Refining Association conference in
Budapest.  “Refinery runs in the third quarter exceeded 80 percent of
our capacity at 10.5 million tons per year, and that’s despite
the fact that not all new installations are running yet,”
Sokolowski said “Good market conditions will allow us to
process some 8 million tons of oil this year, more than 7.6
million we had planned.”  Lotos is now completing a 5.6 billion zloty ($2 billion)
program to increase its capacity by 75 percent to 10.5 million
tons of oil per year. It will also increase output of high-
margin products such as diesel and jet fuel.  Lotos aims to process over 9 million tons of oil in 2011.  “Actual runs at the refinery will correspond with our
expectations of the refining margins,” he said.  A new hydrocracker, or a unit that produces diesel fuel,
will likely come on line at the end of November, one month ahead
of schedule, Sokolowski said. Commercial factors and a desire to
avoid a start-up in the winter were the reasons for this change
in schedule.  The hydrocracker will have a capacity of 2.2 million tons
of oil a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
