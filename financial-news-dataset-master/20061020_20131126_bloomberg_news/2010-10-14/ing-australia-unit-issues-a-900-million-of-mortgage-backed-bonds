ING Bank (Australia) Ltd., a unit of
the biggest Dutch financial services company ING Groep NV,
issued A$900 million ($897 million) of bonds backed by home
loans in its first public issue of the notes in Australia.  The main class of residential mortgage-backed securities,
totaling A$587 million, was priced to yield 105 basis points
more than the bank bill swap rate, according to an e-mailed
statement from the lender, also known as ING Direct. Macquarie
Group Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp. managed the sale, the
statement said.  The Australian Office of Financial Management bought A$250
million of notes priced to yield 110 basis points more than the
bank bill swap rate, according to the statement. The bonds are
backed by home loans originated and serviced by ING Direct, the
statement said.  Australia’s mortgage-bond market froze in 2008 as the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to
avoid all but the safest debt. The government agreed to buy
mortgage bonds during the freeze to help smaller providers of
home loans that rely on securitization for funding. AOFM has
bought more than A$11 billion of notes, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
