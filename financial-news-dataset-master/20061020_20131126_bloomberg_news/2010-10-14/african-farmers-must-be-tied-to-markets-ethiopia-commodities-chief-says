Developing nations need stronger
connections to world markets to stabilize prices and reduce
hunger, according to  Eleni Gabre-Madhin , the chief executive
officer of the  Ethiopia Commodity Exchange .  Trading floors in developing nations give farmers more-
accurate pricing information and encourage construction of the
storage facilities, roads and telephone networks needed to
foster agriculture, Gabre-Madhin said today in an interview at
the annual World Food Prize conference in Des Moines, Iowa.  Farmers in Ethiopia, with experience in commodity trading,
“think global and multinational, rather than thinking local,”
she said. “That means they’re able to make better decisions on
when to sell” and pay closer attention to crop quality, she
said.  Ethiopia is the world’s  sixth-biggest  coffee producer and
fifth-largest grower of lentils, chickpeas, sesame and sorghum,
according to the United Nations. The Ethiopia Commodity Exchange
trades corn, wheat, coffee, white and red kidney beans and soon
will be adding sesame. The country’s  agricultural sector  suffers
from frequent drought and poor cultivation practices, according
to the U.S. government.  The World Food Prize recognizes achievement in food and
agriculture that alleviates hunger and poverty globally. The
annual conference brings together governments, businesses and
humanitarian organizations to discuss farming and international
development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
