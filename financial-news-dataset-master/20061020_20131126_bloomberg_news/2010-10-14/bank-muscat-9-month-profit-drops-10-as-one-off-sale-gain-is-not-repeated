Bank Muscat SAOG , Oman’s biggest
bank by assets, reported a 26 percent increase in third-quarter
profit, helped by higher income from lending and fees.  Net income advanced to 25.2 million rials ($65.5 million)
from 20 million in the year-earlier period, according to
Bloomberg News’s calculations based on the bank’s  nine-month
results  posted on the Muscat bourse today. EFG-Hermes Holding
SAE had forecast a profit of 22 million rials for the quarter.  Net interest income increased 13 percent while other
operating income, including from fees and commission, advanced
17 percent, the figures showed. Bank Muscat set aside 30 million
rials in the nine months to cover for bad loans compared with
68.7 million rials a year earlier, it said in the statement.
Gross loans rose 4.8 percent to 4.11 billion rials from a year
ago, while deposits advanced 4.4 percent to 3.4 billion rials.  Bank Muscat’s nine-month profit fell 10.2 percent as a one-
time gain from the sale of its stake in India’s HDFC Bank Ltd.
last year wasn’t repeated. Net income dropped to 72.2 million
rials from 80.4 million rials a year earlier.  Bank Muscat’s  shares  were unchanged at 0.859 rials at 1:16
p.m. on the Muscat bourse. They have risen 30 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
