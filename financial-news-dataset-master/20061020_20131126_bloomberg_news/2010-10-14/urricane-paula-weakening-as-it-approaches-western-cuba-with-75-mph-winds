Hurricane Paula hugged Cuba’s north
coast as the storm drew closer to Havana with heavy rains and 75
mile per hour winds, the National Hurricane Center said.  Paula was 45 miles (70 kilometers) from Puerto Esperanza
and 135 miles west of the Cuban capital, the center said in a
website  advisory  at 6:40 a.m. Havana time. The system, whose
winds waned earlier from 80 mph, was heading northeast at 5 mph
and forecast to weaken further.  Paula is expected to churn along the center of the island,
diminishing to a tropical storm and then a depression. Tropical
storm warnings were issued for the Pinar del Rio and La Habana
provinces as well as Havana city. The Florida Keys from Craig
Key westward, including the Dry Tortugas, were under a tropical
storm watch for winds of at least 39 mph, the center said.  As much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain in
mountainous areas “could cause life-threatening flash floods
and mud slides,” the center said. “Winds could begin to
increase over the lower and middle Florida Keys late today.”  Paula’s hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph extend 10
miles from the storm’s eye and tropical storm-force winds
stretch outward for 50 miles, the center said. Mexico’s Yucatan
resorts of Cancun and the island of Cozumel were spared the
worst of the storm yesterday when it passed to the east.  To contact the reporter on this story:
