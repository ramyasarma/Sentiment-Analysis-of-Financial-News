U.K. exploration for oil and gas in
the North Sea may pick up after dropping by 20 percent as the
worst recession since World War II weighed on spending plans.  The number of new offshore wells slipped to 24 from 30 in
the three months ended September 2009,  Deloitte LLP  said in a
report published in London today. In the year through September
this year, drilling of exploration and appraisal wells is down 9
percent compared with 2009.  “These are stable levels of activity and we’re optimistic
that drilling continues,” Graham Sadler, managing director of
Deloitte’s Petroleum Services Group, said in a telephone
interview. “As economic conditions improve, there will be more
opportunities to drill.”  Britain pulled out of the  recession  in the fourth quarter,
and oil prices higher than $80 are encouraging companies to
spend more on exploration. While drilling in the North Sea
peaked in the early 1990s,  EnCore Oil Plc  estimates that its new
discoveries in the Catcher structures may hold as much as 300
million barrels of oil.  Korea National Oil Corp. has nearly completed a hostile
takeover of Scotland’s  Dana Petroleum Plc  to gain access to
North Sea resources. In August, EnQuest Plc bought Stratic
Energy Corp. to add to its reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
