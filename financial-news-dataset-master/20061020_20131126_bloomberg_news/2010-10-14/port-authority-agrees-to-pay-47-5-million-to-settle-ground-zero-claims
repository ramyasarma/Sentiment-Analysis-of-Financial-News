The Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey agreed to pay $47.5 million to about 9,000 workers
who claimed illnesses from rescue efforts and debris removal
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.  The settlement, which needs approval by the Port Authority
board, is only for those who sued the agency, which owns the
World Trade Center site.  The money would be in addition to compensation they’re
eligible to receive under a $712.5 million agreement with New
York City, according to a news release from  Worby Groner Edelman 
and  Napoli Bern Ripka LLP , the law firms representing the
workers. About 10,000 workers sued the city on health-related
claims related to the 2001 attacks.  The Port Authority’s settlement will be distributed under
the same formula as the city’s. Claimants will be grouped into
four tiers based on the severity of their injuries. The payments
will range from $2,000 to “tens of thousands,” the news
release said.  The Port Authority isn’t a party to the city’s settlement.  Steve Coleman , a Port Authority spokesman declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
