Brazilian presidential candidate
Dilma Rousseff has an 4.6 percentage-point lead over former Sao
Paulo Governor Jose Serra in the country’s Oct. 31 runoff, a
Sensus poll showed.  Rousseff, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s former
Cabinet chief, was supported by 52.3 percent of those surveyed,
while Serra had 47.7 percent support. The poll of 2,000 people
taken Oct. 11-13 was commissioned by the National Transport
Confederation and had a 2.2 percentage-point margin of error.   This is the first Sensus survey published after the
country’s Oct. 3 first-round vote, when Rousseff had 46.9
percent of valid votes and opposition Brazilian Social Democracy
Party candidate Serra had 32.6 percent of valid votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
