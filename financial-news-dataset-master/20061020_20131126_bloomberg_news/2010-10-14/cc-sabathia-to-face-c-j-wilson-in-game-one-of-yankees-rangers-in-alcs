New York Yankees 21-game winner
 CC Sabathia  will face the Texas Rangers’  C.J. Wilson  in the
opening game of the American League Championship Series.  The teams start their best-of-seven Major League
Baseball series tomorrow night at Rangers Ballpark in
Arlington, Texas.  “You don’t want to get too high or too low; you try
to stay even-keeled,” Sabathia told MLB.com yesterday.
“That’s something I try to do all year -- keep my emotions
in check and go out and make pitches when I need to.”  Sabathia had a 3.18 earned run average in 34 starts
this season while striking out 197 batters.  Following Sabathia in the rotation will be  Phil Hughes 
(18-8),  Andy Pettitte  (11-3) and  A.J. Burnett  (10-15). The
New York roster is the same as the one that swept the
Minnesota Twins 3-0 in the first round of the AL playoffs.  The Rangers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-2 to win
their first postseason series and advance to the ALCS.  “The Yankees historically are the team you have to go
through to get to the World Series,” Wilson told MLB.com.
“We are on a good run now and we played good against them
the second half this season, so we are really optimistic.”  Wilson had a 15-8 record this season with an earned
run average of 3.35. He struck out 170 batters in 33
starts.  The Rangers said  Colby Lewis  (12-13),  Cliff Lee  (12-9)
and  Tommy Hunter  (13-4) will start in Games 2, 3 and 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
