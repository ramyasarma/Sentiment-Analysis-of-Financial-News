A ruling  Democratic Party of Japan 
committee recommended not raising cigarette taxes next year
after this year’s 40 percent increase because the government
should examine the impact on tobacco farmers and manufacturers.  The DPJ’s fiscal panel released its tax reform proposal
today, calling for a “cautious” approach in raising tobacco
taxes after this month’s record increase lifted the price of a
pack of cigarettes by one-third to about 410 yen ($5). The group
also suggested extending a temporary tax break on income from
capital gains and dividends given current economic conditions.  The recommendations may complicate Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s efforts to increase government revenue to pay for social
welfare programs. The administration is seeking to ensure
economic growth while reining in the world’s largest public debt.  Japan is the fourth-largest market by volume for the
world’s tobacco makers, after China, the U.S. and Russia,
according to a report from U.K.-based market researcher ERC
Group. The DPJ panel said Japan should consider raising
cigarette taxes to the levels of Western countries in the future
for health reasons.  The temporary measure cutting the levy on income from
securities transactions to 10 percent from 20 percent is due to
expire at the end at 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
