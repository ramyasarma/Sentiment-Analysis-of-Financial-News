(Corrects amount sought in headline, first paragraph of
story published on Oct. 14.)  Dalian Port (PDA) Co., operator of
China’s largest crude-oil terminal, plans to sell shares in
Shanghai as it seeks 3.7 billion yuan ($560 million) for
expansion plans, it said in a filing to the China Securities
Regulatory Commission.  The CSRC will review Dalian Port’s IPO application on Oct.
18, the regulator said in a separate statement posted on its
website today.  The company, based in Dalian, China, gave a pro-forma 2010
net income forecast of 779 million yuan for the enlarged company,
including assets it’s acquiring from its parent, according to a
separate filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
