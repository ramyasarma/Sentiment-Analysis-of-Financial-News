GDF Suez SA Chief Executive Officer
Gerard Mestrallet told French daily La Tribune in an interview
that the company may seek nuclear expansion in Brazil.  The company needs visibility in electricity price
regulation to enter a country and if Brazil extends the system
in force for dam-generated power then GDF Suez would be
interested, Mestrallet told the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
