Ashmore Group Plc , a U.K. fund
manager that focuses on emerging markets, said assets under
management rose 18 percent in its fiscal first quarter as
inflows increased.  Assets grew to $41.6 billion in the three months to
Sept. 30 from $35.3 billion at the end of the previous quarter,
the London-based company said today in a statement. Inflows
reached $3.4 billion in the quarter, while “positive
performance” netted $2.9 billion.  “Trading conditions are in line with management
expectations and the group remains confident of its prospects
for the current year,” the company said in the statement. “The
inflows were within the multi-strategy theme, principally from
Asian retail investor focused products.”  Ashmore, which first sold shares in 2006, focuses on
emerging markets through local currency, distressed debt and
private equity funds.  “Ashmore’s funds under management came in significantly
higher than our expectations with both higher-than-expected
performance and net inflows,” said  Sri Karthik , an analyst at
Execution Noble, which has a “buy” rating on the stock. “We
remain buyers.”  Ashmore rose as much as 3.7 percent to 375 pence, a record,
and was up 2.6 percent at 371 pence as of 10:06 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
