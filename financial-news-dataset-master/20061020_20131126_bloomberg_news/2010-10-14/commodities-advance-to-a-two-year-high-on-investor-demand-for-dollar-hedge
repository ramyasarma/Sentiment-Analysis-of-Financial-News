Commodities extended a rally to the
highest in two years on speculation the declining U.S. dollar
will boost investments in metals, energies and agriculture
futures.  The  dollar  fell 0.8 percent against a basket of six major
currencies. The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 raw materials
rose as much as 1.1 percent to 577.9490, the highest level since
Oct. 3, 2008. The index gained 3.6 percent in the four sessions
before today. The  UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity
Index  climbed to 1,509.28, the highest since Aug. 4, 2008.  As the greenback declines, investors may buy commodities as
a hedge against inflation. A weaker dollar also boosts
purchasing power for buyers of grains and oilseeds, increasing
demand for U.S. supplies. The currency has weakened on
speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease monetary
policy further in an effort to boost the country’s economy.  “The sharply lower dollar today is supporting most of the
commodity complex,” said  Doug Whitehead , an analyst at Rabobank
in London. “As a whole, the weaker dollar is encouraging
investment into the commodities sphere on an inflation play, and
that’s going to keep demand for commodities as an asset class
strong.”  Gold for immediate delivery climbed $10.75, or 0.8 percent,
to $1,382.90 an ounce at 9:40 a.m. London time. The price
earlier today rose as much as 1.1 percent to a record $1,387.35.
Futures for December delivery gained $12.80, or 0.9 percent, to
$1,383.30 an ounce in New York and touched $1,388.10, also a
record.  Silver Surges  Cash silver increased 55.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $24.55
an ounce, and futures for December delivery gained 62.3 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $24.555 an ounce in New York. Futures earlier
surged to $24.95 an ounce, the highest price since March 1980.  Oil climbed for a second day in New York after an industry-
funded report showed U.S.  crude supplies  fell and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries moved closer to
improving compliance with production cuts.  The November contract jumped as much as $1.11, or 1.3
percent, to $84.12 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 5.4 percent this year.
Brent crude for November settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London advanced 1 percent to $85.44 a barrel.  Corn futures for December delivery surged 7.75 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $5.77 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price has gained 16 percent since the start of trading on
Oct. 8 when the U.S. government released a report showing
production would decline.  Sugar Advances  Soybeans for January delivery rose 13 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $12 a bushel in Chicago. Wheat futures for December
delivery gained 6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $7.0875 a bushel.  Sugar for March delivery gained 0.28 cent, or 1 percent, to
27.78 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
yesterday touched 28.04 cents a pound, the highest since Feb. 5,
on speculation that crops in Brazil, the world’s largest
supplier of the sweetener, will be harmed by drought that lasted
through mid-September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
