Sweden’s krona rose for a sixth day
versus the euro, the longest streak since July, after the
central bank’s deputy governor,  Barbro Wickman-Parak , said the
economic recovery calls for more interest-rate increases.  The krona also reached its strongest level against the
dollar in two years after Wickman-Parak today said she didn’t
believe in a “wait-and-see strategy” for raising rates.
Norway’s krone rose to the strongest since January against the
dollar as the price of crude oil, the nation’s biggest source of
exports, rose to $84.12 a barrel, the highest in a week.  “We see some support to the krona from a hawkish
Riksbank,”  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of currency
research in New York at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a note to
clients today. “Strong domestic activity, shrinking excess
supply and high credit growth mean that the Riksbank should
continue hiking rates.”  The krona appreciated 0.1 percent to 9.2386 per euro at
3:20 p.m. in Stockholm. It gained 1.1 percent to 6.5565 per
dollar, the strongest since Sept. 2008.  Norway’s krone was at 8.0749 per euro from 8.0778
yesterday. It rose 0.9 percent to 5.7351 per dollar.  “I do not believe in a wait-and-see strategy that could
mean that the repo rate needs to be raised even faster further
ahead,” Wickman-Parak said in a speech published on the
Riksbank’s website today. “A slightly higher interest rate now
could make households begin to adjust and contribute to a more
subdued development.”  Policy makers have raised the repo  rate  twice since July,
bringing it to 0.75 percent at their September meeting. They
announce their next decision on Oct. 26.  Nomura’s Nordvig forecast the krona will gain to 8.9 per
euro by the end of March, while the Riksbank raises the repo
rate 0.5 percentage points in 2010 to 1.25 percent and by 0.75
percentage points in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
