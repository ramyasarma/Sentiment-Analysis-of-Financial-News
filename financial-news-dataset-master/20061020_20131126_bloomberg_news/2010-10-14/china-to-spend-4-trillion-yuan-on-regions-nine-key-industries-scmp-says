China will spend more than 4
trillion yuan on inland regions and nine key industries under
the new five-year plan, the South China Morning Post said,
citing two unidentified officials involved in the drafting.  The spending will be targeted at the aerospace, new energy,
new materials, information technology, biology and drug
development, energy conservation and environmental protection,
marine, advanced manufacturing and high-tech services
industries, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper
reported today.  The government is also working on a plan to replace its 10-
year-old ‘Go West’ initiative, the Post said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
