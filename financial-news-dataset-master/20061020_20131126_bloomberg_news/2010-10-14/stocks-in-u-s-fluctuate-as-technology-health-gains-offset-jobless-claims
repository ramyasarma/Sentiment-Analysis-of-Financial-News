U.S. stocks fluctuated as a rally in
technology and health-care shares helped the market overcome an
early slump triggered by an unexpected increase in jobless
claims and regulatory scrutiny over bank foreclosure practices.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,176.98 after tumbling as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average climbed less than 1 point to 11,096.42.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
