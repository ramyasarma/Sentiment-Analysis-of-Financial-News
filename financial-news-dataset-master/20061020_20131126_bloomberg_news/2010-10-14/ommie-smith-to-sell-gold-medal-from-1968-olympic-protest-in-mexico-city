Tommie Smith , an Olympic track
and field champion, is auctioning the gold medal he wore at
the 1968 Mexico City Games when he and American teammate
 John Carlos  lifted gloved fists in a racial protest.  The medal and the red Puma cleats that Smith wore
during the race are being sold online by New York-based
 M.I.T. Memorabilia , curator Gary Zimet said. The auction
for the medal and shoes opened yesterday at $250,000 and
will conclude Nov. 4.  “Tommie has had these items for 42 years and he feels
it is time to share them with the sports memorabilia-
collecting public,” Zimet said in a telephone interview.  Smith, 66, intends to use a portion of the profits to
help fund his philanthropic endeavors and is not selling
the items out of financial distress, Zimet said. Smith
declined to be interviewed.  Smith set a 200-meter world record in Mexico City with
a time of 19.83 seconds. He and Carlos, who won the bronze
medal, took the medal stand wearing black gloves, no shoes
and beaded necklaces in a salute to the U.S. Civil Rights
Movement. As the Star-Spangled Banner played, Smith and
Carlos bowed their heads and raised their gloved fists in a
show of solidarity.  Smith was a backup wide receiver for the Cincinnati
Bengals in 1969, appearing in two games and catching one
pass for 41 yards. He was inducted into the  United States
National Track and Field Hall of Fame  in 1978 and awarded
the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2008 ESPY Awards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
