Colombia’s peso fell the most in a
month after the government said it will keep $1.4 billion in
dividend payments from state oil company Ecopetrol SA overseas
in a bid to ease the local currency’s rally.  After a meeting yesterday with President  Juan Manuel Santos 
and central bank officials, Finance Minister  Juan Carlos Echeverry  said the government’s August dividend from Ecopetrol
was left overseas, and that the same will be done with $700
million from the December dividend.  The peso dropped 0.6 percent to 1801.80 per dollar at 4:11
p.m. New York time, from 1,790.68 yesterday. Earlier it fell 0.8
percent, the biggest decline since Sept. 15. The peso is up 13.4
percent this year, the second-best performance after the Iceland
krona among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Ecopetrol is one of the big market players,” said  Daniel Velandia , head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.
“This places a floor” on the currency, he said. Velandia
predicts the measure will ease pressure on the peso to
strengthen beyond 1,770.  In a bid to ease the peso’s strengthening trend, Colombia’s
central bank said Sept. 15 it will buy a minimum of $20 million
daily for at least four months. While Banco de la Republica has
purchased an average daily of $20 million, policy makers have
said they could buy more or extend purchases beyond the
currently scheduled four months.  ‘Buy Much More’  “We could at any moment go out and buy much more,” bank
Chief Jose Dario Uribe said in an interview with W Radio today.  The bank will use instruments it “considers appropriate,”
to help prevent the peso strengthening further, he said.  “There are other instruments we haven’t used because we
consider the benefits to be lower than the costs,” Uribe said.  Inflation under control gives room for the central bank to
increase the amount of dollars it is purchasing daily, according
to Velandia.  Annual inflation slowed to 2.28 percent last month, within
the central bank target between 2 percent and 4 percent.  Economists lowered their 2010 year-end inflation forecast
to 2.74 percent, according to a central bank survey published
yesterday, down from a median estimate of 2.97 percent last
month.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due
2020 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.09
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.658 centavo to 126.835 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
