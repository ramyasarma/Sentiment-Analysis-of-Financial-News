Ecuador may borrow from the
International Monetary Fund next year for the first time since
2003, former Finance Minister  Fausto Ortiz  said.  Ecuador’s government may seek as much as $500 million from
the IMF and  World Bank  in 2011 to cover an estimated $3.5
billion budget deficit in South America’s seventh-biggest
economy, Ortiz said today in a telephone interview.  Ecuador would have difficulty selling debt internationally
after the government defaulted on $3.2 billion of bonds since
2008, Ortiz said. The government may borrow $1 billion each from
the nation’s pension system and China to help cover the deficit,
Ortiz said from Guayaquil.  “Ecuador needs money,” said Ortiz, a 44-year-old
economist and the second of five Ecuadorean finance ministers
during President  Rafael Correa ’s four years in office. “The
government doesn’t want to touch traditional lenders, but in
2011 they are going to have to approach them because they don’t
have many financing alternatives.”  Finance Minister  Patricio Rivera  won’t comment on Ortiz’s
remarks, an official at the ministry’s press office who can’t be
identified due to government policy said today by telephone. The
government will present congress with next year’s budget by Nov.
1, the person said.  Correa, who paid off Ecuador’s IMF debt in 2007 to free the
country from obligations tied to the loans, has criticized the
agency’s policies, saying last year it was “one of the
guiltiest” of those responsible for the global economic crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
