Japan plans to send about 10
military medics to Afghanistan by the end of this year, Kyodo
News said, citing unidentified military sources.  They will provide training to the Afghan army’s medical
staff in Kabul for six months, the report said. The team may be
expanded and the mission extended, the report said.  The team would be the first Japanese military personnel
sent to Afghanistan, apart from military attaches at the
Japanese Embassy in Kabul, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
