Namakwa Diamonds Ltd. , a miner of
the gems in southern Africa, unearthed an “exceptionally rare”
orange diamond at its mine in South Africa.  The 7.53 carat “vivid orange” diamond will be sold in
Johannesburg this month, London-based Namakwa said in a
 statement  today. The company also discovered a 26.74 carat
diamond. Both stones have “flawless potential” it said.  “Perhaps the most famous vivid orange diamond is the
5.54ct ‘Pumpkin Diamond’ of  Harry Winston  worn by  Halle Berry  at
the 2002 Oscars,” Namakwa said in the statement. The U.S. movie
star won the Oscar for best actress at the event.  Prices of rough, or unpolished, diamonds soared this year,
returning to levels last seen in June 2008, after producers such
as De Beers cut output, gem dealers rebuilt stockpiles and
demand rebounded. Prices have risen as much as 91 percent from a
six-year low in early 2009, data compiled by WWW International
Diamond Consultants Ltd. show. A carat is a fifth of a gram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
