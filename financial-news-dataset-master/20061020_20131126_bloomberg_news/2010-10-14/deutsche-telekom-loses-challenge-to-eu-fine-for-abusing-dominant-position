Deutsche Telekom AG , Europe’s
biggest phone company, lost an appeal against a 12.6 million-
euro ($17.8 million) antitrust fine.  The European Union’s competition regulator was right to
fine the phone company for abusing its dominant market position
in Germany, the EU’s highest court said today.  The Brussels-based European Commission accused Deutsche
Telekom in May 2003 of overcharging competitors for access to
its local phone network. The regulator said so-called margin
squeeze by the Bonn-based operator deterred other companies from
entering the market. Deutsche Telekom, which appealed two months
later, agreed to cut its fees in 2004.  The change in the fees system means the “consequences of
the judgment are quite limited,”  Andreas Middel , a Deutsche
Telekom spokesman, said in a phone interview from Berlin.  Deutsche Telekom lost a first appeal of the fine two years
ago, when the EU’s second-highest court backed the commission’s
decision that the company had abused its dominant position by
charging competitors higher prices than the retail prices end-
users had to pay.  “Squeezing the margins” of competitors who are just as
efficient “causes damage to consumers by limiting the choices
available to them,” the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
ruled today, according to an e-mailed statement.  The case is C-280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
