Corp. Andina de Fomento, the South
American multilateral lender known as CAF, started marketing
sales of 39-month and five-year Samurai bonds, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the transaction.  The Caracas, Venezuela-based company told investors it may
price the shorter-dated notes as early as this week to yield
between 100 basis points and 120 basis points more than the yen
swap rate, said the person, asking not to be named as the
information is private.  CAF may price notes due in 2015 at a spread of between 120
basis points and 140 basis points, said the person. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers. Mizuho Securities Co. and Nomura Securities
Co. are arranging CAF’s sale, according to a filing today with
Japan’s finance ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
