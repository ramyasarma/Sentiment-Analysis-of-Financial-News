German 10-year government bond
yields were near their highest level in two weeks as rising
equities drained demand for the safest assets.  Bund yields remained within the 16-basis-point range they
have occupied since Sept. 24. Italy sold 5.5 billion euros ($7.7
billion) of 2015, 2023 and 2037 bonds today.  The MSCI World
Index  advanced 0.4 percent, a second straight gain. Spanish
bonds rose versus German bunds after the nation’s central bank
said local lenders reduced borrowing from the European Central
Bank by 11 percent in September.  “Risk is on today, and that’s putting bunds under a little
bit of pressure,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The
Italian bond auctions were comfortably absorbed, which led to
modest spread narrowing versus bunds.”  German 10-year yields rose less than one basis point to 2.3
percent as of 4:10 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security due
September 2020 fell 0.04, or 40 euro cents per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 99.65. The yield rose to 2.32 percent on Oct. 8, the
highest since Oct. 1. The two-year note yield rose one basis
point to 0.80 percent.  Irish bonds rose relative to benchmark German bunds,
narrowing the  yield spread  by 26 basis points to 387 basis
points. The  spread  between Italian and German 10-year bonds fell
by two basis points to 145 basis points. Portuguese and Spanish
bonds were also higher versus bunds, while Greek bonds fell.  Italy sold 3.5 billion euros of 3 percent 2015 notes at an
average yield of 2.53 percent, the Bank of Italy said today. The
sale attracted bids worth 1.37 times the securities offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.44 the last time they
were sold, on Sept. 13.  Italian Sales, Spanish Spread  Italy also issued 846 million euros of 4.75 percent 2023
bonds at an average yield of 3.98 percent. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.49 versus 1.5 at the last sale, on July 14. The
1.154 billion-euro sale of 4 percent 2037 bonds were issued at
an average yield of 4.53 percent, and a bid-to-cover ratio of
1.97 versus 1.9 at the previous sale on June 11.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
debt instead of equivalent German paper shrank by four basis
points to 170 basis points. Spanish banks’ ECB borrowings fell
to 97.7 billion euros in September from 109.8 billion euros in
August, the Bank of Spain said today on its website. That
compared with the overall euro region’s increase to 447.7
billion euros from 428.5 billion euros.  ECB Liquidity  Greek bank reliance on ECB liquidity declined in September
for a second-straight month, according to the country’s central
bank. Lenders had a total of 94.3 billion euros for refinancing
operations compared with 95.9 billion euros in August, according
to a statement on the Athens-based Bank of Greece’s website.  German 10-year yields climbed as much as seven basis points
yesterday after European Central Bank Council member  Axel Weber 
said the ECB should stop its bond-buying program and prepare to
withdraw other emergency measures. Bund yields have stayed
within a  range  of 2.36 percent and 2.2 percent since Sept. 24.  The ECB said a policy of raising interest rates to deflate
asset-price bubbles shouldn’t be dismissed on principle.  Recent research has shifted the balance in favor of such an
approach, known as leaning against the wind, “even if the
economic science is still divided on these issues,” the ECB
said in a book published in Frankfurt today. In a footnote to
the book, entitled “Enhancing Monetary Analysis,” the bank
said several members of its Executive Board have in the past
shown “some sympathy for the principle.”  Monetary analysis confirms that “inflationary pressures
remain contained” in the euro region, the ECB said. There are
“neither inflationary nor deflationary risks” and credit
growth is behaving “in line with historical relationships.”  Spain, Italy ‘Well-Placed’  Greek, Irish and Portuguese bond yields will remain at
“wide” premiums to German debt because the nations’ fiscal
problems will persist, HSBC Holdings Inc. said.  Spain and Italy, also seen as high-deficit countries, are
“relatively well-placed” by comparison,  Steve Major , global
head of fixed-income research at HSBC in London, said in an e-
mailed note. He cited the bank’s so-called sovereign scorecard,
which uses data such as ratios of interest payments to revenue
and deficit to gross domestic product.  German bonds have returned 2.1 percent since June 30,
compared with 3 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.7 percent for
U.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Greek bonds handed investors 13 percent returns during the
period, while Irish securities lost 2.6 percent and Portuguese
debt 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
