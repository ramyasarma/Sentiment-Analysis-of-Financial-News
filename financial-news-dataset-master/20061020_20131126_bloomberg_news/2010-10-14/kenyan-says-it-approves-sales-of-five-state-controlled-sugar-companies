Kenya’s government approved the
privatization of five state-controlled sugar mills once their
debt has been reorganized.  “Most of these factories are underperforming and two are
under receivership,” the cabinet said today in an e-mailed
statement from the capital city of Nairobi, adding that
legislators must approve the sale. “Farmers will be given an
opportunity to actively participate in buying shares in the
factories as individuals and co-operatives.”  The mills are Nzoia, Chemelil, Sony, Muhoroni and Miwani.
Capacities are 54,000 metric tons a year for Nzoia, 36,000 tons
for Chemelil, 78,000 tons for Sony and 40,500 tons for Muhoroni,
according to the website of South Africa’s Sugartech. Miwani has
a daily capacity of 1,500 tons crushed, Sugartech said, without
providing an annual capacity.  Kenya expects to produce 550,000 tons of sugar this year,
the Kenya Sugar Board said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
