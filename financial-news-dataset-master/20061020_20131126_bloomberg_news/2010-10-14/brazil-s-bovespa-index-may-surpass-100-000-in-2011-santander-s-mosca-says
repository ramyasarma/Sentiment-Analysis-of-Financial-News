Brazil’s  Bovespa , the country’s main
stock index, may surpass 100,000 next year as domestic demand
spurs purchases of retail and consumer goods stocks, according
to  Banco Santander Brasil SA ’s asset management arm.  “Brazil now has a ratio of two people of working age to
every one of non-working age,” said  Aquiles Mosca , an executive
director at Santander Asset Management. “Infant mortality is
falling. When this happens, consumption takes off.”  The unit of Santander estimates the Bovespa will end 2010
at 80,000, Mosca said in an interview in Sao Paulo yesterday.
The index will rise 20 percentage points more than Santander’s
estimate for Brazil’s  benchmark interest rate  in 2011, he said.  With an  increase  of 4.5 percent so far this year as markets
closed yesterday, the Bovespa is approaching its record high of
73,517 points, reached on May 20, 2008. To hit that mark, the
index has to rise 2.6 percent above the 71,675 points at
yesterday’s close. The  index  rose 0.02 percent to 71,692 points
at 4 p.m. New York time today.  Consumer goods companies and metal producers, in addition
to infrastructure companies involved in “civil construction,
logistics, road concessions and air transport,” should be the
main contributors to boosting the index, Mosca said.  Santander’s estimate is above those of its competitors.
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc  says the index will reach 78,000 points
at the end of the year, according to a note to clients
yesterday.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA  said on Aug. 30 the index
will hit 87,000 points at the end of 2011. Bank of America Corp.
in September estimated it will reach 81,000 points over the next
12 months.  Santander estimates the benchmark interest rate, known as
Selic, will average 11.2 percent in 2011 and end next year at
12.25 percent, Mosca said. An increase of 20 percentage points
above the average Selic would take the Bovespa to 104,960 at the
end of next year. Central bank policy makers held the rate at
10.75 percent at their last meeting on Sept. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
