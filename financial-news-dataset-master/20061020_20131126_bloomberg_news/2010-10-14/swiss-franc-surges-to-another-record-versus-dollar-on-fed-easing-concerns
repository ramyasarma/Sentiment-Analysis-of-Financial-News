The franc strengthened against the
dollar to a second record in as many days amid speculation the
Federal Reserve may be close to restarting asset purchases,
boosting demand for the Swiss currency as a haven.  Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on
Sept. 21, released Oct. 12, said the U.S. central bank’s policy
makers were prepared to pump more cash into the economy through
so-called quantitative easing “before long.” Fed economists
also lowered their U.S. growth forecast for the third
consecutive meeting.  “The Swiss franc is a core safe-haven trade as well as a
strong fundamental play, making it an ideal currency against the
dollar right now,” said  Peter Rosenstreich , chief market
analyst in Geneva at ACM Advanced Currency Markets.  Switzerland’s currency surged as much as 1.3 percent
against the dollar to 94.63 centimes, its strongest ever
according to Bloomberg data, and traded 1.2 percent stronger at
94.73 centimes at 9:09 a.m. in London. It has gained about 8
percent versus the dollar this year. The franc strengthened 0.1
percent against the euro to 1.3368.  The franc has climbed 4.9 percent this year against a
basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
