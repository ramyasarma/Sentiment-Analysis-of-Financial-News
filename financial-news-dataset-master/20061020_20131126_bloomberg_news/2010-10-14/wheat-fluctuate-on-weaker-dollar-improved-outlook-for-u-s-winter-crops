Wheat futures fluctuated as the
slumping dollar raised expectations that U.S. exports will
increase, while rain improved prospects for winter crops in the
Midwest.  The  dollar  slid to a 10-month low today against a basket of
six major currencies, enhancing the appeal of U.S. wheat for
overseas buyers. In the four weeks through Sept. 30, the U.S.
sold 4.8 percent more wheat to importers than in the same time
last year, the Department of Agriculture said last week.
Soft-red winter-wheat areas in the eastern Midwest received 0.5
inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain last night, according to World
Weather Inc.  “Wheat has been picking up support off of the weaker
dollar,” said  Mike Zuzolo , the president of Global Commodity
Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette, Indiana. Still, the rain in
the Midwest “will be helpful to wheat as it goes into the
dormant phase,” he said.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $7.02 a bushel at 11 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price rose as much as 1.4 percent and
dropped 0.7 percent. Before today, the commodity was up 46
percent since the end of June, after drought in Russia and
Eastern Europe harmed crops.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
