Reducing holdings of Treasuries is
China’s most-effective tool for dealing with the U.S., Zhang
Monan, a researcher with the State Information Center, wrote in
a commentary published in the Securities Times newspaper today.  China should ponder how to use its role as the U.S.’s
biggest creditor when yuan appreciation is expected to cause the
value of its foreign exchange reserves to shrink, Zhang wrote.
This role should be used to counter outside pressure, Zhang
wrote.  Cutting its holdings of Treasuries is also in China’s long-
term interests, Zhang wrote. The State Information Center is a
research unit under the National Development and Reform
Commission, China’s top economic planning agency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
