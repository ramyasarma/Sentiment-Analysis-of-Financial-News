Enel SpA  will reduce its debt
through the initial public offering of its Green Power
alternative energy unit later this month and the sale of assets,
Chief Executive Officer  Fulvio Conti  said in an interview with
Corriere della Sera.  The estimated 3 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) IPO and the
sale of assets will cut Enel’s “net financial exposure,” the
Milan-based newspaper quoted Conti as saying. Eighty percent of
Enel’s debt is on fixed interest rate loans or protected from
the risk of rate increases by hedging, Conti told Corriere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
