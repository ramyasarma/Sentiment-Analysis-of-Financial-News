Iraq plans to add capacity next year
to produce 300,000 barrels of oil a day, Minister  Hussain al- Shahristani  said.  The country, the only OPEC member not subject to production
quotas, also will present a draft agreement to the Iraqi cabinet
for a gas joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell Plc by the end of
the year, al-Shahristani told reporters today before the
beginning of closed-door talks.  Shahristani said he expects the first of three single-point
moorings for loading crude in the Persian Gulf to be operating
by the end of next year. All three will be ready by the end of
2012, adding combined capacity of 3 million barrels a day and
bringing the export capacity of southern Iraq to 5 million
barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
