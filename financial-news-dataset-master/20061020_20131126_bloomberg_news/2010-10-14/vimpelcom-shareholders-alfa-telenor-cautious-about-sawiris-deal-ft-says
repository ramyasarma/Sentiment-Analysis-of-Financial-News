Alfa Group, the biggest investor in
 VimpelCom Ltd. , is yet to decide whether it wants VimpelCom’s
deal to acquire most of  Naguib Sawiris ’s telecoms assets to
continue if the Algerian government nationalizes Orascom Telecom
Algeria, the Financial Times said, citing Alfa Group.  VimpelCom’s second-biggest shareholder,  Telenor ASA , also
has concerns about possible regulatory objections in Pakistan
and Bangladesh, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
