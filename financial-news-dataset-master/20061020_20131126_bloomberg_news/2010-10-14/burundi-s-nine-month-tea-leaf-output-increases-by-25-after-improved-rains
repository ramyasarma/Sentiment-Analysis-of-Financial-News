Tea production in Burundi, which
relies on the leaves for half its export revenue, rose 25
percent in the first nine months of this year because of more
rain, the state-run Burundi Tea Board said.  Output from January through September increased to 7,000
metric tons from 5,600 tons for the same period last year, Remy
Ndayininahaze, an official at the board, said today in a phone
interview from the capital, Bujumbura.  “The crop yield is better this year because favorable
rains,” he said. “Last year’s production was affected by a
long drought in the country.”  Production in the central African country is recovering
after it slumped from 9,001 tons in 2001 because of an
insurgency that displaced small-scale farmers who account for 80
percent of the crop, according to the board. Production for the
year is estimated at 8,000 tons, 11 percent higher than in 2009,
Ndayininahaze said.  Exports from January through September increased 20 percent
to 6,000 tons from a year earlier due to the higher output, he
said.  Burundi plans to boost export returns from the crop to $32
million by 2016 from $15 million last year through improved
efficiency, which will be achieved through the sale of
government tea estates to investors, according to a strategy
plan for the industry. Tea produced by Burundi, which exports
more than 95 percent of its crop, is mostly shipped via a weekly
auction in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
