U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton pressed Pakistan to boost taxes on the wealthy to
finance economic reforms and to reduce its reliance on foreign
aid to recover from devastating floods.  “The most important step that Pakistan can take is to pass
meaningful reforms that can expand its tax base,” Clinton told
reporters in Brussels today after meeting European Union foreign
policy chief Catherine Ashton. “I know how difficult it is, but
it is absolutely unacceptable for those with means in Pakistan
not to be doing their fair share to help their own people.”  Clinton also urged the government to take steps to
“alleviate the crippling power shortages that stifle economic
growth while making life difficult for the Pakistani people.”  The EU’s Ashton will chair an international meeting to
discuss support for Pakistan tomorrow in Brussels.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
