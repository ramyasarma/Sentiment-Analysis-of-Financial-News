India’s benchmark stock index fell
from close to a record high as some investors judged the recent
rally has surpassed the outlook for earnings.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the largest engineering company,
dropped the most in more than three months. The shares are
trading at 32.2 times estimated earnings compared with 19.4
times for the main stock gauge. Foreign fund inflows have surged
71 percent this year, making the stock gauge the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China.  Reliance Communications Ltd. , the second-
biggest mobile-phone operator, declined for the first time in
six days.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
fell 190.24, or 0.9 percent, to 20,497.64 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge earlier climbed as much as 0.8
percent, nearing its highest close of 20,873.33 on Jan. 8, 2008.  “Some investors are taking money off the table as the
markets are nearing a record and valuations are playing on
peoples’ minds,” said  Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza
Portfolio Ltd., a New Delhi-based brokerage. “There is a fear
that if liquidity dries up for any reason the rally may end. So
some investors are insuring against that by booking profit.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
0.9 percent to 6,177.35. The  BSE 200 Index  retreated 0.8 percent
to 2,603.37.  Highest Value  The valuation of stocks on the Sensex compares with 13.8
times estimated earnings for Brazil’s Bovespa Index, eight times
for Russia’s Micex Index and 16.4 times for China’s Shanghai
Composite Index, among the so-called BRIC markets.  Larsen & Toubro decreased 3.2 percent to 2,012.05 rupees,
paring its gains this year to 20 percent. Reliance
Communications lost 3.5 percent to 180.6 rupees.  Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Co. has increased the amount
of cash in its funds to as much as 20 percent because Indian
stock prices have exceeded the earnings outlook, said Chief
Investment Officer  Sashi Krishnan .  “We believe valuations are expensive,” Pune-based
Krishnan, who oversees $900 million in assets, said while
attending an investor conference in Mumbai yesterday. “We are
not in a hurry to deploy our cash.”  Infosys Technologies Ltd. , the second-largest software
services provider, advanced 1 percent to 3,185.25 rupees, while
 Wipro Ltd. , the third-biggest software services provider,
increased 1.5 percent to 490.45 rupees. Infosys’s profit will
rise 10 percent to 17 billion rupees, according to the average
of 36 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  7 billion rupees  ($157 million)
of Indian equities on Oct. 12, extending this year’s record
inflows to 1 trillion rupees, according to data on the
Securities and Exchange Board of India’s  website . Foreign
investors bought more shares than they sold for 30 straight
days, the longest stretch in five years amid signs the global
economic recovery is intact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
