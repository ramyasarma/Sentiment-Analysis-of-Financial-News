The ruble fell to its lowest this
year versus the central bank’s euro-dollar basket after oil
retreated and traders tested the regulator’s commitment to a
free float.  The ruble slid 1 percent to 36.2348 versus the target euro-
dollar basket at the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, its weakest level
since Dec. 22 and its steepest decline since Sept. 16, according
to data compiled by the  Micex Exchange . Bank Rossii uses the
basket to smooth currency movements that hurt exporters’
competitiveness. The ruble fell 1 percent to 30.9000 against the
dollar, and was down 1.1 percent versus the euro at 42.7550.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, tumbled 4.3 percent
yesterday after China unexpectedly increased its lending and
deposit rates, raising concern a slowdown in the world’s biggest
energy consumer may hurt global fuel demand. Crude was 1.1
percent higher today at $80.39 per barrel.  The biggest monthly drop in the trade surplus in more than
a year last week will keep pressure on the currency to end-2010,
leaving it “vulnerable” to “speculative attacks” after Bank
Rossii loosened limits on the exchange rate,  Vladimir Osakovsky ,
Moscow-based economist at UniCredit SpA, said by telephone
today.  Bank Rossii widened the so-called floating corridor it uses
to guide the ruble last week as it seeks “increased
flexibility” in the exchange rate, according to First Deputy
Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev . The ruble’s trading corridor was
expanded from 3 rubles to 4, Ulyukayev said, while declining to
specify its parameters. The band is now 32.9 to 36.9 against the
 basket , from the previous 33.4 to 36.4,  Osakovsky , said.  Bets on Weakness  Investors increased bets for a weaker ruble today, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.0405 per
dollar in three months, from 30.9654 on Oct. 19. The contracts,
known as NDFs, are a way of gauging the likely direction of
currencies as they allow companies to hedge against exchange-
rate fluctuations and foreign investors to speculate.  Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 fell for a fifth day,
pushing the yield up four basis points. Dollar bonds maturing
2015 climbed 0.2 percent, yielding 3.080 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
