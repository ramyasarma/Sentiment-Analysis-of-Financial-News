Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
Topix index to its first gain in four days, as China’s record
currency reserves boosted commodity prices and investors’
confidence in an economic recovery.  Sony Corp., an electronics maker that gets about 70 percent
of its revenue overseas, climbed 2 percent, and Toyota Motor
Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, gained 3 percent.
 Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s largest commodities trader, increased
3.1 percent. Yahoo Japan Corp., operator of the country’s most-
visited web portal, jumped 6.4 percent after a report said AOL
Inc. and private-equity investors are exploring a deal for
Yahoo! Inc.  “China will boost demand globally, especially for
commodities,” said  Koichi Kurose , chief strategist in Tokyo at
Resona Bank Ltd., which manages about $57 billion. “The
relatively good data will also boost investors’ expectations the
country will adopt policies to stimulate the economy.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 1.9 percent to 9,583.51
at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix advanced 1.7 percent to
836.95, with about three times as many stocks rising as falling.  As of yesterday, the Topix dropped 17.6 percent from its
high this year on April 15 as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s
steps to curb property prices and concern about the pace of U.S.
economic growth weakened confidence in a global recovery. Stocks
in the index trade at 14.7 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 14 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
12.3 times for the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  Exporters Gain  Sony rose 2 percent to 2,640 yen. Canon Inc., which gets
about 80 percent of its sales abroad, gained 1.7 percent to
3,910 yen. Toyota climbed 3 percent to 2,930 yen, the largest
contributor to the Topix’s gain, followed by  Honda Motor Co. 
Honda, a carmaker that makes more than 80 percent of its revenue
outside Japan, advanced 2.2 percent to 3,005 yen.  Electronics makers and carmakers were the two biggest
contributors to gains by the Topix among its 33 industry groups,
followed by trading houses. All of the groups gained.  Exporters advanced even as the yen appreciated against the
dollar to as much as 81.14 in Tokyo, the highest level since
April 1995, compared with 81.72 as of 9 a.m. when the stock
market opened. A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas income
when repatriated.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.7 percent yesterday
in New York to the highest close since May 3.  CSX Corp. , the
second-largest publicly traded U.S. railroad, reported profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates. China said its foreign-
exchange reserves increased by a record to $2.65 trillion at the
end of September.  Commodities Advance  “China, which is a major source of demand, is unexpectedly
good,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $450 million
in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Global economic sentiment is moderately recovering and
excessive pessimism is receding.”  Mitsubishi, a trading company that gets more than 40
percent of its sales from metal and energy, climbed 3.1 percent
to 2,111 yen and Itochu Corp., Japan’s fourth biggest trading
house, gained 3.5 percent to 791 yen. Inpex Corp., the nation’s
No. 1 oil explorer, jumped 4.1 percent to 454,500 yen and its
closest rival Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. increased 2.2
percent to 3,270 yen.  Oil climbed for a second day in New York after an industry-
funded report showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell and the
International Energy Agency raised its global demand forecast.
Crude oil for November delivery rose 1.6 percent to settle at
$83.01 a barrel yesterday in New York, the highest level since
Oct. 6.  Yahoo Japan  The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals including
aluminum and copper advanced 0.3 percent yesterday to the
highest close since July 2008. The  Baltic Dry Index  of shipping
rates for commodities rose for a second consecutive day.  Yahoo Japan rallied 6.4 percent to 30,600 yen, the most
since Jan. 28 and the biggest advance in the Nikkei 225.  Yahoo!
Inc.  is working with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to help defend
against possible takeover approaches, said three people familiar
with the matter. The company doesn’t have an offer in hand, they
said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that AOL Inc. and
several private-equity investors are exploring a deal for Yahoo!
Inc.  Yahoo! Inc. is the second-largest shareholder of Yahoo
Japan, following Softbank Corp., according to Bloomberg data.
Softbank, Japan’s third-biggest mobile-phone operator, climbed
3.9 percent to 2,751 yen.  Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s No. 1 real estate company by
sales, led developers higher after the Real Estate Economic
Research Institute said in a report that the number of new
condominiums put on the market rose 3.9 percent in September
from a year earlier.  Mitsui Fudosan leapt 4.5 percent to 1,623 yen. Mitsubishi
Estate Co. gained 4.3 percent to 1,530 yen. Sumitomo Realty &
