Metropolitan Holdings Ltd. and
Momentum Group Ltd. will not be allowed to cut jobs for two
years after the merger of the two companies is completed, South

merger and employees must be advised of this, the Pretoria-based
antitrust authority said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
