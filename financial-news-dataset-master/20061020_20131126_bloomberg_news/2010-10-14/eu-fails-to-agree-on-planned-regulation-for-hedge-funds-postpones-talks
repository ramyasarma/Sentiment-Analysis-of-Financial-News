The European Union canceled talks on
regulation of hedge-fund and private-equity managers after
governments clashed on the final shape of proposals.  European nations disagree on the powers of the European
Securities and Markets Authority to decide which hedge funds
will be allowed to market to EU investors,  Sharon Bowles , the
 European Parliament ’s top financial lawmaker, said in a
telephone interview.  “Many countries have doubts over the role of ESMA,”
Bowles, who chairs the Brussels-based Parliament’s economic and
monetary affairs committee, said. Nations also disagree on “how
quickly to grant” non-EU hedge funds access to Europe, she
said.  The  European Commission , the EU’s executive arm,
proposed rules last year to regulate hedge-fund and private-
equity managers, which would restrict bonuses and require
investment strategies to be disclosed to regulators.  Michel Barnier , the EU financial services commissioner, said Oct. 11
that negotiations on the proposals were entering a “decisive”
stage.  Diplomats, lawmakers and commission officials had been
scheduled for talks today aimed at reaching an accord on the
rules.  Bowles said the disagreements between governments mean more
time is needed before the three groups can thrash out an
agreement. The Parliament delayed an Oct. 20 vote on the
measures until next month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
