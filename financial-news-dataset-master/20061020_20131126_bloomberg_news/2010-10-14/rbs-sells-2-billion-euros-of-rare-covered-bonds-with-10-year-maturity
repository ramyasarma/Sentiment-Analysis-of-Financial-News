Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
the U.K.’s biggest government-owned bank, offered 2 billion
euros ($2.8 billion) of 10-year covered bonds in the bank’s
third issue of the securities.  The notes were marketed at a yield of 140 basis points more
than the benchmark mid-swap rate, a banker involved in the deal
said, which is equivalent to about 4.01 percent. RBS issued its
first covered bond on June 9, selling 1.25 billion euros of
notes due 2013, and raised 1.5 billion euros on Sept. 1 from
five-year securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a win-win situation for both investors and the
bank,” said  Franz Rudolf , a credit analyst at UniCredit SpA
based in Munich, Germany. “Buyers benefit from the high-quality
asset with the rarer longer duration of 10 years and RBS can get
attractive long-term funding.”  Covered bonds sales total 281 billion euros this year, up
43 percent compared with the same period in 2009. Banks are
rushing to sell the notes as a source of cheaper funding as the
securities typically get a top credit rating because they’re
backed by home or state-sector loans as well as the issuer’s
guarantee.  “The spread on offer for RBS’s new covered bonds looks
attractive given the very high quality of the underlying
collateral,” UniCredit’s Rudolf said. “There will be plenty of
demand for the longer maturity on offer.”  HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis, Banco Santander SA and
UniCredit SpA are managing the sale with RBS.  To contact the reporters on this story:
