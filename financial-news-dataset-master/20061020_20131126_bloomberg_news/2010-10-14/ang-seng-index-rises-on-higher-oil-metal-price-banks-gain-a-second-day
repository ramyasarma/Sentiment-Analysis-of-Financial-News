Hong Kong  stocks  rose as lenders
gained for a second day after Chinese bank loans increased, and
as commodity producers climbed on higher oil and metal prices.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s

People’s Bank of China yesterday showed Chinese banks extended
595.5 billion yuan ($89 billion) in new local-currency loans

Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies advanced 2.1
percent to 13,575.95.  “There are expectations for China’s banking sectors and
its strong loan growth,” said  Castor Pang , Hong Kong-based
research director at Cinda International Holdings Ltd. “The
increase in new loans eased concerns about China’s further
tightening measures this year.  A measure of banks had the biggest gain among the Hang Seng
Index’s four industry groups for a second day. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China rose 5 percent to HK$6.35 and Bank of
Communications climbed 3.4 percent to HK$9.24.  Bank of China
Ltd. , the nation’s fourth-largest lender by market value,

yesterday, beating the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 18 economists for 500 billion yuan.  PetroChina rose 1.2 percent to HK$10.06, and  Cnooc Ltd. ,

since Oct. 6. The  London Metal Exchange Index  of six metals
including aluminum and copper advanced 0.3 percent yesterday to
the highest close since July 2008.  “Overall demand for materials in the future seems quite
promising. If the U.S. and China continue to deliver a strong
economic rebound, then commodity stocks in the short term will
be quite attractive,” Cinda’s Pang said.  Liquidity Wave  The Hang Seng Index has surged 26 percent from its low this
year on May 25 amid optimism the U.S. economy will avoid falling
back into a recession and that China will spur growth. Shares in
the gauge trade at an average 15.3 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with 12.5 times on May 25.  “Economic data in Asian markets seem to be still stronger
than the U.S. and European countries,” Cinda’s Pang said.

Seng Index for the end of 2011, in a report dated yesterday. The

The bank turned bullish on stocks in China and the rest of Asia,
saying they will benefit from a global “liquidity wave” as
central banks around the world reverse their monetary-tightening
policies, according to a report sent yesterday.  Emil Wolter  and
 Dylan Cheang , Singapore-based analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland,
raised their view on Chinese and Asian stocks to “overweight”
from “underweight.”  Mongolian Mining  China Healthcare Holdings Ltd. , a provider of health-care
