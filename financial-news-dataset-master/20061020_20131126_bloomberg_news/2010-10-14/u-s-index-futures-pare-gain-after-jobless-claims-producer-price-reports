U.S. stock-index futures pared gains
after initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased and
wholesale costs rose at a pace that suggests limited demand is
restraining inflation.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December climbed 0.1 percent to 1,176 at 8:34 a.m. in New York
after rising as much as 0.6 percent earlier. Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures increased 12 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 11,056.  Jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 462,000 in the week ended
Oct. 9, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. The
total number of people on unemployment insurance rolls decreased
to the lowest level since November 2008, while those getting
extended benefits declined.  The so-called core producer price index, which excludes
food and energy, increased 0.1 percent last month, Labor
Department figures showed. Including volatile food and energy
costs, wholesale prices rose 0.4 percent, exceeding the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Of the eight S&P 500 companies to reported third-quarter
results since Oct. 8, seven have beaten analysts’ estimates for
net income and sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Eighteen companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to release
third-quarter results this week. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
predict 23 percent profit growth from a year earlier for the
companies in the index, the fourth straight quarterly increase
after a record nine-quarter slump in net income.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
