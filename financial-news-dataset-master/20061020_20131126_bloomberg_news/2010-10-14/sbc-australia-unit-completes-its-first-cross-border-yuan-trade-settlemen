HSBC Holdings Plc ’s Australian unit
completed its first cross-border yuan trade settlement with a
transaction for aluminum trader PanAsia Group (Australia).  The deal was with PanAsia’s supplier in China, which also
banks with HSBC in Shenzhen, according to an e-mailed statement
today from the bank.  “China is one of the most important growth markets for
Australian companies and the ability to settle trade and other
international payments” in yuan gives companies increased
flexibility, Andrew Skinner, head of trade and supply chain for
HSBC Bank Australia Ltd. said in the statement.  China approved use of the yuan to settle cross-border trade
with Hong Kong in June 2009, part of a drive to reduce reliance
on the U.S. dollar. The central bank said last month it will
allow more regions and companies to settle cross-border trade in
the nation’s currency and boost offshore usage of the yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
