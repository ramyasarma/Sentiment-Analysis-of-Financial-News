Prices of repossessed apartments
built on six Spanish golf courses designed by  Jack Nicklaus  have
been slashed by as much as 50 percent as banks try to sell
assets acquired during the property market collapse.  A two-bedroom, 74 square-meter (796 square-foot) penthouse
in Murcia, southern Spain, is on sale for 128,800 euros
($180,000), down from 272,000 euros three years ago. It
overlooks the 18-hole  Hacienda Riquelme course  and has air
conditioning, a 32 square-meter terrace and communal pool.  Spain’s real-estate and construction slump left thousands
of vacation properties unsold and their builders facing
bankruptcy. The number of homes purchased in Spain by foreigners
dropped 78 percent from 2006 through 2009, according to a study
published last week by the property website Fotocasa.es and the
IESE Business School in Barcelona.  “This shows how desperate the banks are to offload their
real estate,” said  Borja Mateo , author of the book “The Truth
About the Spanish Housing Market.” “The properties still look
overvalued.”  Polaris World , the closely held builder of the Murcia
resorts, handed over 1,500 properties and land to lenders in May
2009 to cancel 970 million euros of debt. Now the banks, which
include  Banco Popular Espanol SA , are using hefty discounts and
100 percent mortgage deals to help clear the backlog, according
to the website of Villa Cashback, which specializes in marketing
the Murcia apartments to British buyers.  An 85 square-meter, ground-floor apartment with two
bedrooms overlooking the  Mar Menor  golf resort is on sale for
159,000 euros, down 28 percent from the 2007 price.  No Offers  Anne Simpson, a 55-year-old from the Scottish city of
Glasgow, is trying to sell her vacation home overlooking
Hacienda Riquelme, which she bought in 2003 for 192,000 euros
before it was built. She’s had no offers so far and thinks she’d
be lucky to get 150,000 euros for it.  “As beautiful as the resorts are, they are in the middle
of nowhere,” she said. “It’s getting better and more
populated, but it’s still a bit of a wilderness.”  Golf became part of the construction mania that swept Spain
in the decade through 2007 as prices for privately owned homes
tripled. The country built more courses in the period than any
member of the euro region except Germany, according to the
 European Golf Association.  There are now 345 in Spain, 92
percent more than in 1997.  Existing home prices in Spain have fallen 22.5 percent
since peaking in April 2007, the study from Fotocasa.es and IESE
showed. The country now has about 1.4 million unsold homes,
according to Aguirre Newman, a Madrid-based property adviser.  Fallout in Spain  Spanish banks took about 60 billion euros of real estate
onto their books as a result of the country’s worst recession in
60 years. Starting Sept. 30, the central bank enforced tighter
rules on how much lenders have to set aside in provisions for
the assets, making it more expensive to hold on to them.  In Murcia, a region providing easy access to the 250
kilometers (155 miles) of beaches lining Spain’s Costa Calida,
there are 21 golf courses within 50 kilometers of each other.  Hacienda Riquelme is the largest of  six  courses that were
fashioned by  Nicklaus Design , the company founded by the 18-time
golf major winner, and completed between 2005 and 2009. Three
are now run by Ola Golf, a company subcontracted by  IRM Estates ,
the group of banks that canceled Polaris World’s debt in
exchange for assets.  The others are managed by Polaris, which is 40 percent-
owned by Credit Suisse Group AG, according to  Polaris’s website .
Beatriz Suarez, a spokeswoman for Polaris, couldn’t be reached
for comment for this story. IRM Estates also couldn’t be
reached. Neither Nicklaus nor his company have any investment or
involvement in the resorts, said Scott Tolley, his spokesman.  More Inquiries  There are signs the deep discounts for the Nicklaus golf
apartments may be starting to spur interest, according to Paul
Williams, managing director of U.K.-based  Villa Cashback . He
said his company sold four times as many of them in the first
half of 2010 as it did a year earlier, declining to be more
specific. He’s getting twice as many inquiries as last year.  “For the first time since 2008, we have seen the return of
the ‘blind buyer,’ where a property is reserved without viewing,
usually for the best discounted bank bargains,” Williams said.
“Two years ago, the overriding sentiment was fear; now it’s
opportunism.”  The British traditionally account for about 70 percent of
overseas buyers of Spanish property. They may not be eager to
splash out on vacation homes as the U.K. economic recovery
falters and the government cuts spending to tackle a record
budget deficit.  Brits in Spain  In 2007, about 45 percent of British buyers in Spain
invested 250,000 euros to 350,000 euros, according to U.K.
homebuilder  Taylor Wimpey Plc , which markets golfing properties
in the Spanish cities of Marbella and Alicante. Today, 20
percent are looking to spend 250,000 euros or more and 5 percent
are prepared to spend more than 350,000 euros.  Gillian Kirk-Bushnell, a 67-year-old retired sales
executive from near Canterbury, England, lives in her three-
bedroom villa on the Mar Menor resort all year. She bought the
property four years ago for 389,000 euros.  “For 132 euros a month, my lawns are mowed and irrigated,
the communal gardens are kept immaculate and we have 24-hour,
year-round security,” she said in an interview at the resort,
surrounded by pristine greens, tropical trees and exotic plants.
“This is a huge asset for people looking to invest in holiday
homes.”  Murcia’s Outlook  Murcia spent 750 million euros in the past two years to
boost infrastructure and lure visitors. A new international
airport in Covera, a town 20 kilometers from Murcia’s city
center, is scheduled to open in 2011, and a high-speed rail link
connecting the area to Madrid is due for completion in 2014.  Paramount Pictures Corp. has also reached a preliminary
licensing agreement with the Regional Government of Murcia for a
movie-themed leisure park to be built in the area, according to
Pedro Alberto Cruz, Murcia’s regional councillor for culture and
tourism. The project could bring 20,000 jobs to Murcia, which
has an unemployment rate of 21.3 percent, he said.  Kirk-Bushnell says she has no regrets about buying her
place, even though it has dropped in value.  “It’s irrelevant,” she said. “We live in paradise here
and I’m not going anywhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
