Copper may rise in London on
speculation that the Federal Reserve might ease monetary policy
to stoke U.S. economic growth, weighing on the dollar, a survey
showed.  Six of 11 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 55 percent, said the metal will gain next week.
Four predicted lower prices and one expected little change.
Copper for delivery in three months was up 0.7 percent for this
week at $8,372 a metric ton at 3 p.m. yesterday on the London
Metal Exchange.  “Copper looks to be following the currency moves, and the
dollar looks set to weaken further,” said  Randy North , a trader
at RBC Capital Markets in London.  The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength, has slid 2.8 percent this month amid
speculation that Fed policy makers may unveil more steps
intended to spur growth at their next meeting on Nov. 2-3.
Copper has risen 4.5 percent in that span. A weaker dollar makes
metals priced in the currency cheaper in terms of other monies.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of Oct. 8.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
52 of the past 107 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results:  Bullish : 6  Bearish : 4 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on the story:
