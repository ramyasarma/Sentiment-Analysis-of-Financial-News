Argentina’s wheat output, the
largest in South America, will rise more than previously
forecast after rain and high soil moisture levels helped the
crop’s development, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said.  Output for the 2010-2011 crop will likely be more than
12 million tons, up from an estimate of 11.3 million tons last
week, the exchange said today in an e-mailed  report . The
previous crop, harvested this year, was 7.5 million tons.  Output is rebounding after a two-year drought that started
in 2007 pared yields, making last year’s crop the smallest in a
century. Higher-than-average rains last month boosted soil
moisture levels, helping the grain in the growing stages.  Most of Argentina’s wheat crop is harvested in December and
January.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 2.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $7.0050 a bushel at 1:25 p.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  The Argentine corn crop is 53 percent planted and is
forecast to cover 3 million hectares, the same surface as a week
earlier, the exchange said in its report.  The soybean crop forecast was also maintained at 18.7
million hectares, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
