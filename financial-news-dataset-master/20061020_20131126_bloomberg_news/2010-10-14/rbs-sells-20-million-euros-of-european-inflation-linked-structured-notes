Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  is
selling as much as 20 million euros ($28 million) of structured
notes linked to European inflation.  The six-year securities pay a fixed coupon of 3 percent in
the first three years, according to RBS. After that the note
switches to a coupon paying the harmonized index of consumer
prices in Europe with the minimum payment set at 3 percent.  “Since April, we are seeing people requesting a minimum
yield and participation in inflation,” said  Gurpreet Kharaud ,
vice president of retail product structuring at RBS. “Though
people don’t think inflation will rise just yet, they are
looking to it for the future.”  European inflation  accelerated to the fastest in almost two
years in September, rising 1.8 percent from a year earlier after
increasing 1.6 percent in August, the European Union statistics
office in Luxembourg said Sept. 30.  RBS’s notes are listed on Scoach, the structured products
trading platform run by Deutsche Boerse AG and Switzerland’s SWX
Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
