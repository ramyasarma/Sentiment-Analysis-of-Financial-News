Cotton futures climbed to a record
on signs that China, the world’s largest user and buyer, may
boost imports to meet demand from textile makers.  Cotton for December delivery jumped as much as 3.6 percent
to $1.1487 per pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, before
trading at $1.147 at 4:18 p.m. Singapore time.  China’s commercial cotton inventory, or stockpiles held by
non-government entities, was 107,000 metric tons in September,
98,000 tons lower than the previous month, the China Cotton
Association said on its website today. Xinjiang, the nation’s
largest producing region, has sold almost all of the crop
harvested last year, the association said.  “The figures announced are a confirmation” of market
speculation that supply is getting tighter in China, Chung Yang
Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone from
Singapore today. “The government may do something to relieve
the market, like increasing imports.”  The crop condition in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter, deteriorated in the week ended Oct. 10, with 55
percent in good or excellent condition, from 56 percent a week
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Oct. 12.  The USDA lowered on Oct. 8 its forecast for China’s cotton
output to 31.5 million bales, from 32.5 million bales a month
earlier. The department also cut its estimate of the country’s
inventory for the end of the 2010-2011 marketing year because of
higher demand. A bale weighs 480 pounds (218 kilos).  To contact the reporter on this story:
