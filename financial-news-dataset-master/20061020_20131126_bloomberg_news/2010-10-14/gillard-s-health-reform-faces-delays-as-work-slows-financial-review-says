Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard’s health and hospital reform may be delayed as work on
independent pricing has stopped, the Australian Financial
Review reported.  The Independent Hospital Pricing Authority was due to start
operations in the middle of next year and preliminary work was
stopped when the election was called, the newspaper said. Health
Minister Nicola Roxon is considering alternatives to move to
independent pricing, the newspaper said, citing Roxon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
