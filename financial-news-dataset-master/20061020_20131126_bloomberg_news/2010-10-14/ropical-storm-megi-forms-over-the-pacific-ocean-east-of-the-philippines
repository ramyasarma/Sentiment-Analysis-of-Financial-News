A tropical storm formed over the
Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines, the U.S. Navy Joint
Typhoon Warning Center said.  Tropical Storm Megi was about 2,160 kilometers (1,340 miles)
east of Manila at 2 a.m. local time today, the center said on
its  website . The storm was almost stationary and is forecast to
reach Luzon, the country’s most populous island, in five days.  The storm’s maximum sustained winds were 93 kilometers per
hour and may strengthen to 222 kph before it reaches the
Philippines, the center said. That would make it a Category 4
storm, the second-strongest, on the  Saffir-Simpson  Hurricane
Wind scale. Waves reached 3.7 meters (12 feet).  Megi is the name of a catfish in South Korea and is related
to the feeling of getting wet, according to the Hong Kong
Observatory, which lists names assigned to storms in the
Northwest Pacific and South China Sea. Megi is the 15th storm of
the Northwest Pacific season.  Typhoon Conson left 102 people dead in the Philippines in
July and destroyed or partially destroyed over 70,000 homes, the
National Disaster Coordinating Council  said  in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
