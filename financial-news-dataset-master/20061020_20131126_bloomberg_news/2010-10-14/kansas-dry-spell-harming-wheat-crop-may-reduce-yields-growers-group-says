Dry weather is harming recently
planted wheat crops in western Kansas and may reduce yields when
the fields are harvested next year, a growers group said.  Crops are “poor to average” because dry conditions have
limited the emergence of wheat plants in the western third of
the state, David Schemm, vice president of the Kansas
Association of Wheat Growers, said in an e-mailed statement. Dry
weather has forced some farmers to delay planting, which may
reduce test weights and kernel sizes at harvest, cutting yields.
Kansas is the largest U.S. winter-wheat producing state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
