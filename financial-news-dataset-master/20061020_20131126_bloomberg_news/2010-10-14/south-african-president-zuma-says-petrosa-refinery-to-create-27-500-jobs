PetroSA Ltd.’s new refinery will
create 27,500 jobs, South African President Jacob Zuma said.  The state-owned oil and gas company that supplies 7 percent
of South Africa’s energy needs will help save 12.6 billion rand
in energy costs with the new plant, Zuma said in an e-mailed
copy of a speech delivered in Mossel Bay today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
