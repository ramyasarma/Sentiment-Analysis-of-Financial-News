India’s  10-year bonds  gained for the
first time in six days on speculation yields at their highest
level in almost seven weeks will lure investors.  A government report tomorrow may show the rate of  inflation 
in September held at the same pace as the previous month,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The  Reserve Bank of India  has
raised benchmark interest rates five times this year to slow
the increase in consumer prices. The central bank next meets to
review monetary policy on Nov. 2.  “Some people are probably seeing this as a good level to
add to their portfolio,” said  Mukesh Kumar , a fixed-income
trader at State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 fell one
basis point to 8 percent as of 9:33 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. The price rose 0.11, or 11
paise per 100 rupee face amount to 98.69.  Official data may show the  wholesale price index  climbed
8.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, fell two basis points to 6.64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
