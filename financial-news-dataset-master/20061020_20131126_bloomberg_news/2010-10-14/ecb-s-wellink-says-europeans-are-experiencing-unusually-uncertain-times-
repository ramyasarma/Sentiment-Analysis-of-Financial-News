European Central Bank Governing
Council Member Nout Wellink said “we currently live in
unusually uncertain times.”  “The economic situation in most countries has
stabilized,” Wellink, who also heads the Dutch central bank,
said today in prepared remarks handed out ahead of the award
ceremony of the Christiaan Huygens Prize for Economy in
Voorburg, Netherlands.  “A new situation has arisen, with extremely high
government deficits, unprecedentedly low interest rates and a
financial industry that needs to be put further in order,”
Wellink said. Government stabilization measures have contributed
to “new uncertainties,” Wellink also said.    To contact the reporter on this story:
