Safeway Inc. , the fourth-largest
U.S. supermarket chain by sales, posted third-quarter profit
that topped analysts’ projections as income-tax expenses
dropped.  Safeway said today that profit, excluding some items, was
35 cents a share, beating the 31-cent average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. A drop in Safeway’s tax rate helped add 2
cents in profit. Sales fell less than 1 percent to $9.4 billion.  The grocer is increasingly vying with discount retailers
such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  and Target Corp. for customers.
U.S. consumers have sought discounts as they struggle to recover
from the economic slump and an unemployment rate close to a 26-
year high. Consumers now expect to get the same prices at
Safeway as at discounters, Safeway Chief Executive Officer  Steve Burd  said on a conference call.  Safeway rose 34 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $21.66 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have
gained 1.7 percent this year.  Net income  fell to $122.8 million, or 33 cents a share, the
Pleasanton, California-based company said. A year earlier,
third-quarter profit amounted to $128.8 million, or 31 cents.  Safeway also said full-year earnings will come in at the
lower end of its outlook. In July, the company cut its earnings
 forecast  for the year to at least $1.50 a share from a minimum
of $1.65. Analysts on average project $1.56.  Safeway trails Wal-Mart, Kroger Co. and Costco Wholesale
Corp. in grocery sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
