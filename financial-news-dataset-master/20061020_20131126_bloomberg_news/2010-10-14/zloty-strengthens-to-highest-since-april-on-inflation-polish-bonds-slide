The zloty rose to its strongest in
more than five months against the euro after a report yesterday
showed inflation accelerated faster than economists estimated,
raising bets that borrowing costs will increase by year-end.  The zloty appreciated 0.2 percent to 3.8967 per euro, the
strongest intraday level since April  27, at 8:07 a.m. in
Warsaw. Bonds fell, pushing the yield on five-year notes up four
basis points to 5.17 percent, the highest since Sept. 13.  The Polish currency jumped 1.4 percent yesterday, the
biggest one-day rally since May, after a government report
showed  inflation  accelerated to 2.5 percent in September,
topping the 2.3 percent pace predicted by economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  The report prompted derivatives traders, as indicated in
forward rate agreements, to increase their wagers that rates
will rise before the end of the year as growth in one of the
European Union’s fastest-growing economies picks up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
