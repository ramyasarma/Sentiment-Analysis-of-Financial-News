Conditions imposed by South Africa’s
antitrust regulator on the merger of Metropolitan Holdings Ltd.
and FirstRand Ltd.’s Momentum Group are “more rigid” than the
companies expected, the Chief Executive Officer-designate of the
combined entity said.  “We are considering the alternatives open to us, amongst
which are accepting the decision or lodging an appeal,”
Nicolaas Kruger, who will head up MMI Holdings Ltd., said in an
e-mailed statement today.  South Africa’s Competition Tribunal approved the merger on
condition that the companies will not cut jobs, bar senior
managers, for two years after the merger of the companies is
completed, the Pretoria-based antitrust authority said in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
