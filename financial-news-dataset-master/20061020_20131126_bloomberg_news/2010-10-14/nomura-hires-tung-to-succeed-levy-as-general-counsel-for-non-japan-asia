Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s
largest brokerage, named Wanda Chang Tung to succeed  Clifford Levy  as its top lawyer in Asia outside Japan, according to a
company memo seen by Bloomberg.  Tung, who had led Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s legal
department in Asia outside Japan, starts work in Hong Kong on
Oct. 18, according to the memo.  Levy, 47, will become a senior adviser to the regional
management team, after having “played a critical role” in the
integration of the brokerage with Lehman’s businesses in Asia,
 Philip Lynch , the regional chief executive wrote in the memo.  Sunny Tucker, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Nomura,
confirmed the memo’s content and declined to comment further.  Tung will head Nomura’s legal and compliance division in
the region, overseeing lawyers in corporate, transactions and
compliance departments. Prior to Lehman she was Assistant
General Counsel in Asia at  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
