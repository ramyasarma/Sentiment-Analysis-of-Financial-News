Cocoa prices dropped in London and
New York after the European Cocoa Association reported the first
drop in beans usage in a year.  Grindings, an indication of demand for cocoa beans, totaled
331,182 metric tons in the third quarter, down 4 percent from a
year earlier, the Brussels-based cocoa association said today.
German processing fell 5.7 percent over the same period. Cocoa
prices in June rose to the highest price since at least 1989.  “A small increase was expected, so this drop is somewhat
of a surprise,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt. High prices may have contributed to the decline
in demand, he said.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell 28 pounds, or 1.5
percent, to 1,886 pounds ($3,026) a ton by 10:42 a.m. in London
on NYSE Liffe. In New York, the December futures dropped 0.6
percent to $2,849 a ton on ICE Futures U.S.  Cocoa grindings for the season started this month are
forecast to rise 2.7 percent, the International Cocoa
Organization Executive Director  Jean-Marc Anga  said yesterday.
Prices surged to the high of 2,608 pounds a ton in June, partly
on speculation that economic growth would boost demand for the
beans to make chocolate. Grindings advanced 4.1 percent in the
2009-10 season that ended in September, after falling 6.9
percent a year earlier because of the global recession,
according to the ICCO.  Sugar Gains  Sugar prices extended gains, with the raw sugar futures in
New York rising for a sixth day, the longest rally since Dec. 3,
2009, on reduced crop prospects for Brazil, the world’s largest
producer, and Russia.  Brazil’s harvest estimate has been lowered to 38.15 million
metric tons from 38.7 million forecast in April and Russia may
have to boost imports as dry weather constrained output in both
countries, Standard Chartered Plc said Oct. 12. Russia is
forecast to be the third largest importer in 2010-11 starting
Oct. 1, after the European Union and Indonesia, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Producers that hedged supplies against lower prices have
bought back supplies, boosting sugar, according to analyst
 Jonathan Kingsman .  The so-called producer short-covering was “in reaction to
lower production estimates in Russia and Brazil,” Kingsman,
managing director of Lausanne, Switzerland-based research
company Kingsman SA, said by e-mail today. Buying by investment
funds has “largely been sidelined,” he said.  White, or refined, sugar for December delivery rose $2.20,
or 0.3 percent, to $703.30 a ton. Raw sugar futures in New York
jumped 0.6 percent to 27.66 cents a pound on ICE.  Robusta coffee for January delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1,681 a ton and  arabica  coffee jumped 1.1 percent to $1.8815 a
pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
