China’s Ambassador to Canada, Lan
Lijun, said today that his country is watching “closely” BHP
Billiton Ltd.’s “hostile” bid to acquire Potash Corp. of
Sasktachewan Inc.  Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a conference on
Chinese-Canadian relations, Lan said the fertilizer is an
important commodity for China. He also declined to say if a
China-backed bid for Potash would emerge, calling it a
“commercial” matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
