Harvard Business School  received $50
million from India’s Tata Group and its related philanthropies
to fund a new academic and residential building in Boston for
executive-education programs.  The gift is the largest from an international donor in the
business school’s 102-year history, Harvard said in an e-mailed
statement today. Half the 9,000 business leaders in the school’s
Advanced Management Program each year come from abroad.  Mumbai-based  Tata Group  has operations in steel, cars and
hotels and owns 28 publicly traded companies with a combined
market value of $80 billion, according to the statement.  Ratan Tata , 72, chairman of Tata Sons Ltd., attended the business
school’s management program in 1975.  “We are pleased that this gift will support the school’s
educational mission to mold the next generation of global
business leaders,” Tata said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
