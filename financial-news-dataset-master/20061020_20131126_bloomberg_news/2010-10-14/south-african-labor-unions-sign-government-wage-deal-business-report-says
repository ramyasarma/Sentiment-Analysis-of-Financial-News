Labor unions affiliated to the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, with the exception of
the South African Democratic Teachers Union, signed a wage deal
with the government, Business Report said.  Groups representing 36 percent of Cosatu’s civil service
members accepted the offer, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
reported, citing Sizwe Pamla, spokesman for the National
Education, Health and Allied Workers Union. The Independent
Labor Caucus, which represents 11 labor unions, has asked for
more time to consult on the offer, it said, citing chairman
Chris Klopper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
