U.S. sales of video-game hardware,
software and accessories fell 8 percent to $1.22 billion in
September from a year earlier, researcher  NPD Group  said.  The results reflect a 19 percent drop in hardware sales, a
6 percent decline in software and a 13 percent gain in
accessories on purchases of products such as  Sony Corp. ’s Move
controller, the Port Washington, New York-based researcher said
today in an e-mail. Sales of  Nintendo Co.  hardware tumbled.  Microsoft Corp.  separately said it sold 484,000 Xbox 360
consoles during the month, up 37 percent from a year earlier,
buoyed by the game “Halo: Reach,” which sold 3.3 million
copies in its debut last month. “Halo” is the Redmond,
Washington-based company’s most popular franchise.  Nintendo, based in Kyoto, sold 254,000 Wii consoles and
403,000 Nintendo DS handhelds during the month, the company’s
U.S. unit said in an e-mailed statement. A year earlier,
Nintendo sold 462,800 Wii consoles and 524,200 DS handhelds.  Sony didn’t report sales of its PlayStation3. During the
month, the Tokyo-based company introduced the “Move”,
resembling Wii’s motion-activated wand, with a price of $49.99.  NPD announced Oct. 12 that it would no longer break out
unit sales of consoles by manufacturer. Instead, it reported
total hardware revenue fell to $383 million from $472 million a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
