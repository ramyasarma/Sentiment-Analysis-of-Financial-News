The Kazakh tenge may strengthen as
much as 3.9 percent next year should rising oil prices and
quickening inflation spur the central bank to ease its controls
over the currency, Citigroup Inc. says.  The former Soviet republic’s exchange rate may appreciate
to 142 per dollar should crude average $90 to $95 a barrel and
inflation jump above 9 percent, Citigroup’s chief economist in
Moscow,  Elina Ribakova , and analyst  Natalia Novikova  wrote in a
research note e-mailed today.  The tenge was little changed at 147.6075 per dollar at
11:54 a.m. in Almaty, near its 147.3257 per dollar average for
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  National Bank of Kazakhstan , which manages the tenge by
buying and selling foreign currency, said in June it would
prevent the tenge from moving more than 0.3 percent against the
dollar each trading session. Kazakhstan holds 3 percent of the
world’s crude reserves, according to BP Plc. Oil rose 1.1
percent to $83.92 a barrel in New York today.  Kazakh inflation 
was 6.7 percent in September, the quickest since July.  Kazakhstan’s currency will probably stay within a 146.5 to
147 range for the rest of this year, Citigroup said. The ruble
strengthening beyond 28 per dollar would also be a “trigger”
for tenge appreciation in 2011, the note said. The ruble gained
0.4 percent to 29.9685 per dollar in Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
