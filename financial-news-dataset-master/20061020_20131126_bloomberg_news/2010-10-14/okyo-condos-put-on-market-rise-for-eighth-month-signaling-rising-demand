The number of condominiums put up
for sale in Tokyo and surrounding areas rose for an eighth month,
suggesting Japanese property developers expect demand to improve.  The number of new condominiums put on the market rose 3.9
percent in September from a year earlier, the Real Estate
Economic Research Institute said in a report released in Tokyo
today. The average price per unit rose 11 percent to 50.2
million yen ($618,000) from a year earlier.  The Topix Real Estate Index, measuring 44 property-related
stocks, extended its gain after the data was released, closing 4
percent higher.  Goldcrest Co., a Tokyo-based condominium builder, rose 7.4
percent, NTT Urban Development Corp. gained 5 percent and Meiwa
Estate Co. increased 6.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
