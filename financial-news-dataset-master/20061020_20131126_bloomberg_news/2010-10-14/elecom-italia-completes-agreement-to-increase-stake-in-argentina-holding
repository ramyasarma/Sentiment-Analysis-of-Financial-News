Telecom Italia SpA  completed an
agreement to raise its stake in Sofora Telecomunicaciones SA,
the holding company that controls Telecom Argentina SA, to 58
percent from 50 percent.  “This is a clear positive for Telecom Italia in our
view,” Barclays Plc said in a note today. The transaction will
help it “improve the group’s growth profile” and reduce
leverage, the brokerage said.  Milan-based Telecom Italia, Italy’s biggest phone company,
said in a statement that the accord will have a “positive one-
off effect on the bottom line” of Telecom Italia’s fourth-
quarter results of about 250 million euros ($352 million).  The company is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 4.
Telecom Italia rose 1.5 percent to 1.07 euros at 4:22 p.m. in
Milan, giving the company a market value of 19.6 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
