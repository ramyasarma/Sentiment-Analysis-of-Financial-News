DP World Ltd., the world’s fourth-
largest port operator, expanded capacity and concession in
Sokhna, Egypt.  “The new terminal at Sokhna port, which is located at the
southern end of the Suez Canal, will have a quay length of 1,300
meters and a capacity of 1.75 million TEU, more than doubling DP
World Sokhna’s existing capacity,” the company said in a
statement on Nasdaq Dubai today. The new capacity will be
available in four years.   The new agreement replaces the original concession
agreement awarded to DP World Sokhna and further extends the
concession to 35 years after the construction of the new
terminal, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
