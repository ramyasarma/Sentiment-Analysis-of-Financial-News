Hugo Boss AG , the German luxury
clothier, rose in Frankfurt trading after a strong third quarter
led the company to raise annual sales and earnings forecasts.  The preferred stock  gained  2.07 euros to 46.12 euros at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading, a rise of 4.7 percent, the biggest
advance since May.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items will rise about 20 percent for the year,
according to the Metzingen-based company, which previously
forecast growth of 10 percent to 12 percent. Sales are set to
climb 5 percent, compared with the previous forecast of 3
percent to 5 percent, Boss said today in an e-mailed statement.  Third-quarter revenue increased 19 percent to 538 million
euros ($756 million), driven by the company’s own stores and a
joint venture with Chinese fashion retailer Rainbow Group, which
started in July. Chief Financial Officer  Mark Langer  said in an
August interview that Boss plans to open as many as 20 stores in
China during the remainder of 2010, compared with a worldwide
total of 50 additional outlets for the year.  “The new Ebitda guidance for 2010 significantly exceeds
our own expectation,”  Herbert Sturm , an analyst at DZ Bank in
Frankfurt wrote in a note. The analyst will “most likely”
raise his fair value estimate of 50 euros a share, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
