The board of ICE Futures U.S. may
rule by tomorrow on a proposal to change the benchmark coffee
contract to allow beans from Brazil to satisfy delivery
obligations, Brazilian Agriculture Minister Wagner Rossi said.  The exchange is considering adding Brazil, the largest
coffee grower, to the list of acceptable suppliers, he said
today in a telephone interview from Ribeirao Preto, in Sao Paulo
state. The change would boost exports of coffee from Brazil, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
