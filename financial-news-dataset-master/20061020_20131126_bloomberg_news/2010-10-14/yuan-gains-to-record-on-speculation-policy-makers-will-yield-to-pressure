China’s yuan advanced to its
strongest level since 1993 on speculation policy makers will
yield to intensifying international pressure to let the currency
appreciate faster.  The central bank set the reference rate at 6.6582 per
dollar, the highest level since a peg was dropped in July 2005,
as the U.S. Dollar  Index  traded on ICE Futures in New York slid
for a third day. U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max
Baucus said yesterday a bill punishing China over the value of
the yuan may well pass in the U.S. Senate, with Congress
submitting it to President Barack Obama for his signature.  “It’s partly due to the pressure on the international
front,” said  Emmanuel Ng , a currency strategist at Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The broad dollar weakened
yesterday and today. We have a combination of two factors.”  The yuan rose 0.2 percent to 6.6508 per dollar as of 5:30
p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It touched 6.6503, the strongest level since the central
bank unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.4 percent
to 6.4288 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 3.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner renewed his
call for China to let its currency rise in a speech last week to
the International Monetary Fund. The yuan has strengthened 2.5
percent since China’s central bank on June 19 pledged to pursue
a more flexible exchange rate, after combating gains for almost
two years to help exporters weather the global financial crisis.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  Ven Ram ,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
