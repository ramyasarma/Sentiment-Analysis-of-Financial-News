Vale SA , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, and  African Rainbow Minerals Ltd.  plan to invest
$1 billion within the next five years on the new Konkola North
copper mine in Zambia.  The mine will initially produce 45,000 metric tons of
copper, rising to 100,000 tons at full production, African
Rainbow Minerals Chairman  Patrice Motsepe  told reporters today
in Chililabombwe, about 430 kilometers (270 miles) north of the
Zambian capital, Lusaka.  “We have invested $400 million over the next two years as
part of phase one but in the next three to five years we plan to
invest $1 billion,” he said.  African Rainbow Minerals and Vale formed a joint venture to
develop the mine in Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper producer.
Konkola North is expected to reach full production in 2015,
Johannesburg-based African Rainbow said on Aug. 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
