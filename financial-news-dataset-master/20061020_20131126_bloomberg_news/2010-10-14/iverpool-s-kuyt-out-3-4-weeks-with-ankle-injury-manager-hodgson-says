Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt is
expected to miss three to four weeks with an ankle injury,
manager Roy Hodgson said.  Kuyt landed awkwardly during the Netherlands’ 4-1 win over
Sweden in a Euro 2012 qualifying match two days ago, and Dutch
newspaper De Telegraaf reported he may miss the rest of 2010. An
examination by Liverpool team doctors revealed the injury is not
as serious as first thought.  “They think it is more likely to be one month, or if we
are lucky, three weeks,” Hodgson said on Liverpool’s website.
“He seriously twisted his ankle with ligament damage and we are
going to miss him for some matches, that’s for sure.”  Kuyt, 30, has one goal in five games this season. Liverpool
visits city rival Everton in the Premier League in three days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
