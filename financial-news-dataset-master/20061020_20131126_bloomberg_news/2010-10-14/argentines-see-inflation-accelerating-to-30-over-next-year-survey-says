Argentines expect consumer prices to
rise 30 percent over the next 12 months, according to a poll by
Buenos Aires-based Torcuato Di Tella University.  Inflation expectations are accelerating after remaining
stable at 25 percent the past five months, the university said
in a statement today.  The Oct. 1-12 poll of 1,209 people by Poliarquia
Consultores had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
