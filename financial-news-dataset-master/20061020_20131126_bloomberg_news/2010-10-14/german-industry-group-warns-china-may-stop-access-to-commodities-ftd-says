German industrial companies are
concerned that China may block their access to commodities such
as rare earth metals, the Financial Times Deutschland said,
citing a document presented yesterday by a lobby group.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government needs to develop a
“commodities strategy” that secures access to raw materials in
the long run, the newspaper quoted  Klaus Mangold , the chairman
of a lobby group that represents companies doing business in
eastern Europe and Asia, as saying.  China’s export restrictions on rare earth metals are an
“unfriendly act,” the newspaper quoted German Economy Minister
 Rainer Bruederle  as saying yesterday. A scarcity of metals such
as tungsten and germanium is causing difficulties for sectors
including wind turbine makers, makers of electronics and car
companies, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
