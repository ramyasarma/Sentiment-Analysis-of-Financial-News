South Africa’s government will reach
a decision on a wage offer for state workers next week, Public
Service & Administration Minister Richard Baloyi told reporters
in Cape Town today.  Public-sector labor unions haven’t reached the 50.1 percent
minimum level of agreements needed for the government to
implement its pay offer, unions said yesterday.  Only 36 percent of unions affiliated to the Congress of
South African Trade Unions agreed to sign the wage offer, Asanda
Fongqo, spokesman for the Democratic Nursing Organization of
South Africa, said. The Independent Labor Caucus has requested
more time to consult with members after unions failed to agree
to sign the offer, Chris Klopper, chairman of the group, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
