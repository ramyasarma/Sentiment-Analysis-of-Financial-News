Singapore billionaire Peter Lim
dropped his attempt to purchase Liverpool soccer club, saying
the team’s board and lender, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
refused to meet with him.  “The board and RBS have chosen not to respond or to
discuss my offer with me,” Lim said today in an e-mailed
statement. “My representatives even offered to meet the board
last night.”  Liverpool’s board wants to sell the 18-time English
champion to New England Sports Ventures LLC, the owner of the
Boston Red Sox baseball team, Lim said. He said he may revisit
his bid “if current events cause the circumstances to change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
