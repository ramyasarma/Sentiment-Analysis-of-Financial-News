Societe Generale SA , France’s
second-biggest bank by market value, raised A$500 million ($499
million) from its first sale of Kangaroo bonds.  The Paris-based lender sold A$250 million of 6.75 percent
notes due October 2014 priced to yield 6.87 percent, according
to an e-mailed statement today from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, which helped manage the sale. It also sold A$250
million of similar-maturity floating-rate notes that pay 150
basis points more than the three-month bank bill swap rate.  “It’s a positive result for the borrower because it
diversifies their funding avenues,”  Mark Reade , Sydney-based
credit strategist at Citigroup Inc., said by phone today. “It’s
also good from an investor’s perspective because it gives them
more diversity in terms of where they can invest their funds.”  Borrowers issued a record A$33.4 billion of Kangaroo bonds
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit
Agricole SA , France’s third-largest bank, raised A$900 million
this month from its first sale of the securities after initially
planning to sell about A$300 million.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and UBS AG
helped arrange Societe Generale’s bond sale with Commonwealth
Bank, the statement said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. Kangaroo bonds are Australian dollar-denominated notes
offered by foreign issuers in Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
