---------------------------------------------------------------  Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: U.S. stocks declined, dragging benchmark indexes down
from five-month highs, as financial companies slumped amid
concern over growing legal scrutiny of home foreclosure
practices.

slid more than 5 percent to lead financial stocks in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a 2.5 percent drop.

New York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 35.42 points, or 0.3
percent, to 11,060.66.  London: European stocks declined from a one-month high as an
unexpected increase in U.S. jobless-benefit claims and concern
that banks may have to raise more capital overshadowed better-
than-estimated company earnings.
*Rio Tinto Group climbed to a two-year high after reporting
record iron ore production.
*Syngenta AG, the world’s biggest maker of agricultural
chemicals, rose 3.8 percent as sales beat analysts’ estimates.

the 4:30 p.m. close in London as four stocks fell for every
three that advanced.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks rose, sending the Topix index to its
first gain in four days, as China’s record currency reserves

economic recovery.
*Yahoo Japan Corp. jumped 6.4 percent after a report said AOL
Inc. and private-equity investors are exploring a deal for
Yahoo! Inc.
* The broader Topix advanced 1.7 percent to 836.95, with about

1.7 percent to 4,699.10 at the close of trading in Sydney. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index increased 1 percent to 3,262.60 in
Wellington.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar fell below 81 yen for the first time since
April 1995 as initial jobless claims rose and the trade deficit

*The greenback slid 0.7 percent to $1.4063 per euro. It touched
$1.4122, the weakest level since Jan. 6.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries fell as the U.S. sold $13 billion of 30-
year bonds to lower-than-average demand amid speculation the
Federal Reserve will buy shorter-term securities if it resumes
pumping money into the economy to spur a recovery.

$24.435 an ounce in New York. Earlier, the price reached $24.95,

declined, boosting demand for metals as alternative investments.
*Copper for delivery in three months  rose $38, or 0.5 percent,
to $8,400 a metric ton ($3.81 a pound) on the London Metal
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $8,490, the highest
level for a most-active contract since July 8, 2008.  OIL  New York: Crude oil fell after a government report showed U.S.
petroleum demand dropped to the lowest level in more than 10
months as the economy struggled to recover.
*The U.S. Energy Department reported total petroleum demand
decreased 0.7 percent to 18.3 million barrels a day in the week
ended Oct. 8, the lowest level November.
*Oil for November delivery fell 34 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
