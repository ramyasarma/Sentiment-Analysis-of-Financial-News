German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
coalition will discuss an overhaul of the country’s value-added
tax system from September 2011 at the earliest,  Leipziger
Volkszeitung  reported.  A revamp of sales tax, which would include scrapping a
discounted rate for several goods and services, might come after
regional elections in states including Baden-Wuerttemberg, the
newspaper said, citing senior members of Merkel’s ruling
Christian Democrats and their Christian Social Union Bavarian
sister party.  Merkel’s Cabinet in January will discuss a simplification
of Germany’s overall tax system, which may lead to tax revenue
losses of 500 million euros ($704 million), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
