Gold futures in India, the largest
user of bullion, surpassed 20,000 rupees ($453) per 10 grams for
the first time, spurred by gains in global prices of the metal.  The December-delivery contract added as much as 0.7 percent
to a record 20,028 rupees and was at 19,975 rupees at 2:25 p.m.
on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. in Mumbai. Local
prices have rallied 20 percent this year.  Bullion demand in India almost doubled in the first half
even as prices advanced as investors sought a haven and rising
incomes spurred jewelry sales, the World Gold Council said in
August. Spot gold and New York futures reached all-time highs
today as investors sought an alternative to a weaker dollar.  “Higher prices have not killed demand in India,”  Anjani Sinha , chief executive officer of the National Spot Exchange
Ltd., the nation’s biggest bourse for trading physical gold,
said from Mumbai. “People feel prices will go up further.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose to a record for a second
day, reaching $1,387.35 an ounce. Futures for December delivery
advanced to an all-time high of $1,388.10 in New York.  Domestic prices may climb to 22,000 rupees, Harmesh Arora,
vice president of the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd., said by
phone in Mumbai. The nation’s imports this month may exceed 50
metric tons, he said, without giving a year-earlier figure.  Festive Demand  The nation’s total gold demand was 365 tons in the first
half, up from 188.4 tons a year ago, while jewelry demand rose
67 percent to 272.5 tons, according to the council.  “Record prices seems not to have hit demand majorly,”
said Arora. “Jewelers are buying to build up stocks for
festival sales.”  India’s festival season began last month and bullion sales
usually reach a peak during the Hindu festival of Diwali, which
falls on Nov. 5 this year. The wedding season runs from November
to December and from late March through early May.  Record prices haven’t lead to an increase in recycling of
old jewelry, said Arora.  “Earlier when prices were going high we found that a lot
of people wanted to sell gold,” National Exchange’s Sinha said.
“That scenario is not valid right now.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
