Treasuries fell, pushing 30-year
bond yields to a four-week high, as a U.S. sale of $13 billion
of the securities drew lower-than-average demand amid bets the
Federal Reserve may buy shorter-term notes to spur the economy.  The bonds drew a yield of 3.852 percent, higher than the
average forecast of 3.831 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of
6 of the Fed’s 18 primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount offered,
was 2.49, the lowest since February. Inflation expectations rose
to five-month highs before a speech tomorrow by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  “It’s a concern about when quantitative easing comes,
they’re going to buy 10-years on in, and they’re not going to
buy 30-years,” said  Jeff Given , part of a group that manages
$18 billion of bonds at MFC Global Investment LLC in Boston.
“So there’s a lack of sponsorship out there because of that.”  The yield on the  30-year bond  increased nine basis points,
or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.91 percent at 4:43 p.m. in New
York, according to BGCantor Market Data. It reached 3.92
percent, the highest level since Sept. 17. The 3.875 percent
security due in August 2040 dropped 1 19/32, or $15.94 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 10/32.  The  10-year note  yield rose eight basis points to 2.5
percent and touched 2.51 percent, the highest since Oct. 4.  The auction, the final of three offerings of notes and
bonds this week totaling $66 billion, was the second reopening
of the $16 billion 30-year sale on Aug. 12. The securities drew
yields of 3.954 percent in August and 3.82 percent in September.  ‘Unattractive Auction’  “The 30-year was always set to be an unattractive auction,
but the degree of sloppiness remains a surprise to many,”  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in Memphis,
Tennessee, wrote in a note to clients.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 32.4 percent of the securities
today, compared with 36.1 percent at the September auction and
an average for the past 10 sales of 35.8 percent. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.1 percent, versus a 17.6
percent average for the past 10 offerings. The average bid-to-
cover ratio for the past 10 auctions was 2.7.  Long-bond yields rose on each of the past four trading days
on concern a resumption of debt purchases by the Fed to
stimulate the economy, a strategy known as quantitative easing,
would concentrate on securities maturing in 5 to 10 years.  ‘Unintended Consequences’  “Expectation of QE is already built into the market,”
said  Andy Richman , who oversees $10 billion as a strategist in
Palm Beach, Florida, for SunTrust Bank’s private wealth
management division. “Some are worried about inflation without
growth as well. Inflation is not a big concern, but it’s one of
the unintended consequences of continuing zero interest rates,
QE 1 and also QE 2.”  Bernanke is scheduled to speak on monetary policy
objectives and tools tomorrow at a conference in Boston.  “Some expect the chairman to lay out the potential
framework for QE2,”  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. rates
strategy for fixed income and currencies at primary dealer Royal
Bank of Canada in New York, wrote in a note to clients. “There
is also speculation that Bernanke will speak to potential
inflation targeting.”  Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said today that
additional purchases of Treasuries by the central bank may help
reduce the unemployment rate, which was 9.6 percent last month.
The Fed’s goal is “not to have further disinflation,” he said
in an interview with CNBC.  Inflation Expectations  A government report tomorrow will show U.S. inflation was
in check last month, economists said. Consumer prices rose 0.2
percent in September after a 0.3 percent gain the prior month, a
Bloomberg News survey forecast.  The  spread  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, an indication of inflation
expectations over the life of the securities, touched 2.18
percentage points, the widest since May 19. The five-year
average is 2.10 percentage points. The so-called break-even rate
for  30-year TIPS  and comparable U.S. bonds reached 2.56
percentage points, also a five-month high.  The gap between yields on 10-year Treasuries and the year-
over-year consumer price index, known as real yields, was 1.36
percentage points. It touched a 2010 high of 2.07 percentage
points in July and a 0.86 percentage point low in January.  Treasuries fell yesterday after demand was weaker than
average at a sale of 10-year notes that raised $21 billion. The
bid-to-cover ratio was 2.99 versus an average of 3.1 for the
past 10 sales. The offering drew a yield of 2.475 percent.  Reinvestment Program  Thirty-year bonds later erased losses after the Fed said it
would purchase about $32 billion in U.S. debt over the next
month, including securities maturing in 2040, in its program to
reinvest proceeds from its holdings of mortgage bonds.  The U.S. auctioned $32 billion of three-year debt on Oct.
12 at a record-low yield of 0.569 percent.  The Treasury can continue to cut auctions of nominal
coupons of less than 7 years’ maturity by $1 billion per month
until the February quarterly refunding on anticipation that the
U.S. budget deficit will narrow, according to primary dealer
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The firm lowered its forecast for the
fiscal 2011 shortfall to $1.25 trillion, from $1.3 trillion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
