Canada’s  trade deficit  narrowed more
than expected in August from a record the previous month, as
shipments abroad increased and imports fell.  The deficit narrowed to C$1.34 billion ($1.34 billion) in
August, from a revised C$2.55 billion in July, which was the
largest in records dating to 1971, Statistics Canada said today
in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the gap
would narrow to C$2.3 billion from an initially reported July
gap of C$2.74 billion, according to the median of 16 estimates.  “For the quarter as a whole, trade is still going to be a
sharp drag on the economy,” said  Derek Holt , economist at Bank
of Nova Scotia in Toronto. “We are in a period of prolonged
weakness,” in part because of the risk of further strength in
the Canadian dollar, he said.  The Canadian currency strengthened before the report today
to beyond parity with its U.S. counterpart for the first time
since April, in part on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve
will take actions next week to reduce that currency’s value. The
Canadian dollar gained as much as 0.5 percent to 99.81 Canadian
cents per U.S. dollar, and was down 0.2 percent to C$1.0049 at
9:57 a.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0033 yesterday. One Canadian
dollar buys 99.51 U.S. cents.  Trade Deficit  Canada’s trade balance went into deficit at the end of 2008
and was negative for 14 of the next 20 months after a global
recession and strengthening currency lowered demand for the
country’s manufactured goods. The Bank of Canada estimated in
July that trade will reduce the economic growth rate by 1.6
percentage points this year, leaving it at 3.5 percent.  Exports  in August rose 3.1 percent to C$34 billion. Higher
prices for metals such as gold and copper led a 5.8 percent gain
in industrial goods to C$8.02 billion, and the other consumer
goods category jumped 27 percent to C$1.62 billion on medical
products. Export prices rose 0.2 percent and volumes rose 2.9
percent.  Imports  fell 0.5 percent to C$35.3 billion led by
automotive products, which dropped 6.5 percent to C$5.84
billion. Import prices fell 0.8 percent and volumes rose 0.3
percent.  Canada’s  trade surplus with  the U.S., its largest trade
partner, widened to C$2.95 billion in August from a revised
C$1.53 billion the prior month. The first increase in the
bilateral trade surplus since December 2009 was led by a 2.7
percent gain in exports and a 3.3 percent decline in imports,
Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
