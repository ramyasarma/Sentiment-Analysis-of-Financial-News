Sun Life Financial Inc.  said
President  Jon Boscia , considered a possible successor to Chief
Executive Officer  Donald Stewart , will retire in the first
quarter of 2011.  Boscia, 58, will join Sun Life’s board of directors, the
Toronto-based insurer said today in a statement. The company
doesn’t plan to replace him, said spokesman  Frank Switzer .  Boscia, former CEO of Lincoln Financial Group, was
considered along with Chief Operating Officer  Dean Connor  as a
possible successor when  Stewart , 63, retires, Canaccord Genuity
analyst  Mario Mendonca  said.  “The president role was created just so that we all
understood there were two front-runners for the role of CEO,”
Mendonca said. “It sounds like they’re going to go with Dean
Connor.”  Canada’s third-biggest insurer named Boscia president and
head of its U.S. business as part of a management shuffle in
September 2008. Sun Life gave Boscia added responsibilities for
its Asia and U.K. units in January, when the company promoted
Connor to chief operating officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
