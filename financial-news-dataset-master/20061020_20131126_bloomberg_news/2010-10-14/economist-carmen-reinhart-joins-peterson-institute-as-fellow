Carmen Reinhart , the University of
Maryland professor who has studied eight centuries of financial
crises, was named a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, the Washington-based nonprofit said.  Reinhart, co-author of the 2009 book “This Time Is
Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,” is being
appointed to an endowed chair named after the late  Dennis Weatherstone , former chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s predecessor company, according to a release from
the institute.  Reinhart, 55, had been at the University of Maryland since
1996. Her husband,  Vincent Reinhart , is a former monetary-
affairs director at the Federal Reserve and now resident scholar
at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based
research organization that favors limited government and free
markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
