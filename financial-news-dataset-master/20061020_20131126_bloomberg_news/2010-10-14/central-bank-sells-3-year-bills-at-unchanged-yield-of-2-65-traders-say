The People’s Bank of China sold
three-year bills at a yield of 2.65 percent, unchanged for a
sixth sale in a row, according to traders at Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and China Citic Bank Corp.  The monetary authority offered 16 billion yuan ($2.4
billion) of the securities at the auction today.  The yield dropped at five sales previously since the
central bank resumed bi-weekly offerings of the securities April
8 to help drain cash from the financial system. The rate last
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.65
percent on July 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
