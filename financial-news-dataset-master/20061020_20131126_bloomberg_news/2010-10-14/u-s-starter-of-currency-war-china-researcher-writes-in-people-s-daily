The U.S. started the so-called
currency war, Li Xiangyang, a researcher with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in the People’s Daily’s
overseas edition today.  The world should be wary of the recent depreciation of the
dollar as it is “strongly” driven by U.S.’s own interests, Li
wrote. If more developed countries begin inventions, it may have
negative impacts on the global economic recovery, Li wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
