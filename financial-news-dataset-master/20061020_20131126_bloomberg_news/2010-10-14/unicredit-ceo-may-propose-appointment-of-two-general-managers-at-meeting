UniCredit SpA  Chief Executive
Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  may propose the appointment of two
general managers in an attempt to smooth relations with
investors, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Ghizzoni, who succeeded Alessandro Profumo Sept. 30, will
nominate Deputy CEOs  Roberto Nicastro  and  Sergio Ermotti  to the
new positions at a board meeting next week, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the discussions are private.  Ghizzoni is putting in place a new  management  structure in
an effort to end the investor infighting that led to the
departure of Profumo, who clashed with Italian banking
foundations that own 11 percent of the company. Shareholders,
including Fondazione Cassamarca, are urging Italy’s biggest bank
to create a general manager position to focus on local issues.  “Nicastro’s nomination may get the support of foundations
worried about the bank’s retail business, while Ermotti may win
the market’s favor,” said  Fabrizio Spagna , the CEO of Axia
Financial Research in Padua, Italy.  Nicastro, 45, who was considered for the CEO job last
month, is a former McKinsey & Co. consultant and joined Credito
Italiano as head of planning in 1997. In 2003 he was appointed
head of the bank’s retail division and became one of the deputy
CEOs in 2007.  Ermotti, 50, worked 18 years at Merrill Lynch and joined
UniCredit in 2005 as head of its markets and investment banking
division. He was named a deputy CEO in July 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
