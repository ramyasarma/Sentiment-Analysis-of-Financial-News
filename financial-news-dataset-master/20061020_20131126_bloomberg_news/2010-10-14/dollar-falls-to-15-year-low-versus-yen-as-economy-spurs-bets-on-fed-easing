The dollar fell below 81 yen for the
first time since April 1995 as initial jobless claims rose and
the trade deficit widened, adding to speculation U.S. efforts to
ease monetary policy will erode the value of the currency.  Greenback  losses  deepened earlier after Singapore allowed
appreciation of its currency in a bid to control inflation,
pulling back from an effort to stem gains. Australia’s dollar
rallied to a record and Canada’s dollar reached parity for the
first time since April as investors sought the currencies of
nations with higher-returning assets.  “People are putting a lot of faith and trust in this
easing,” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York. “That will just weaken
the dollar across the board.”  The dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 81.47 yen at 4:07 p.m. in
New York, from 81.81 yesterday. It touched 80.89 yen, the 15-
year low. The greenback slid 0.9 percent to $1.4083 per euro,
from $1.3961. It touched $1.4122, the weakest level since Jan.
26. The euro gained 0.5 percent to 114.74 yen, from 114.20.  The U.S. currency fell versus most of its major
counterparts on bets the Fed will increase purchases of
government debt in a policy known as quantitative easing. The
dollar slid to a record low for a second day versus the Swiss
franc, dropping as much as 1.3 percent to 94.63 centimes.  There’s a 78 percent chance the yen will equal the record
79.75 per dollar by the end of this quarter, according to
options trading monitored by Bloomberg. The currency pair
reached that level on April 19, 1995.  Toyota Restructuring  Toyota Motor Corp. is considering accelerating a
restructuring of production in Japan and overseas to cope with
the yen’s appreciation, said Kyodo News, without citing anyone.  Gold climbed to a record for a second day as a weaker
dollar spurred demand for an alternative investment. Stocks in
the U.S. fell, pushing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down 0.4
after it touched a five-month high yesterday.  Singapore’s dollar gained as much as 1.1 percent to
S$1.2894 against the U.S. currency, the strongest level since
1981, when Bloomberg’s data begin. It later advanced 0.5 percent
to S$1.2964. The  Monetary Authority of Singapore  said it will
steepen and widen the band in which its dollar trades against a
basket of currencies, seeking a “modest and gradual” advance.  “The way the foreign-exchange markets have been
interpreting the Singapore move is that it opens the door to
broad-based Asian appreciation,” said  Steven Englander , head of
Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York.  Boost in Ringgit  Other Asian currencies rallied. Malaysia’s ringgit gained
0.4 percent to 3.0828 against the dollar after touching 3.0800,
the strongest level in 13 years. South Korea’s won climbed 0.9
percent to 1,111.10 versus the dollar after reaching 1.110.05,
the strongest level since May 3.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-traded currencies outside Japan, reached
115.84, the highest level since April 2008.  Australia’s dollar rallied as much as 0.9 percent to 99.94
U.S. cents, the most since exchange controls were removed in
1983, before gaining 0.3 percent to 99.34. Canada’s currency
appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 99.81 cents per U.S.
dollar before trading 0.3 percent lower at C$1.0063.  Sweden’s krona rose for a sixth day versus the euro in the
longest stretch of gains since July after the Riksbank’s deputy
governor,  Barbro Wickman-Parak , said the economic recovery calls
for more interest-rate increases. The krona appreciated 0.2
percent to 9.2290 per euro.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index , used by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to
track the greenback against currencies including the euro, yen
and Swiss franc, slid as much as 1.1 percent to 76.259, the
lowest level since Dec. 14.  The gauge of the greenback has dropped 4.9 percent since
Sept. 21, when the central bank said in a statement following
its policy meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional
accommodation if needed” to support the recovery. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  will speak tomorrow in Boston.  Initial jobless claims  unexpectedly increased to 462,000 in
the week ended Oct. 9, from a revised 449,000, the Labor
Department reported. The U.S. trade deficit widened 8.8 percent
to $46.3 billion in August,  Commerce Department  figures showed.  “The dollar has two main drivers: the outlook for growth
and the Fed,” said  Jessica Hoversen , a Chicago-based analyst at
the futures broker MF Global Holdings Ltd. “The Fed is
desperate to do whatever it can to reinflate the economy.”  China’s yuan advanced to its strongest level against the
dollar since 1993 on speculation policy makers will yield to
international pressure to let the currency appreciate faster.  The Chinese central bank set the reference rate at 6.6582
per dollar, the strongest level since a peg was dropped in July
2005. The yuan touched 6.6503, the strongest level since the
central bank unified the official and market exchange rates at
the end of 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
