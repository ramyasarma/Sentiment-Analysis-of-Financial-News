Taiwan’s dollar advanced to its
strongest level in more than two years on optimism China will
boost holdings of assets in developing economies as its foreign-
exchange assets expand.  China’s reserves rose $194 billion to a record $2.65
trillion in the third quarter, the central bank said
yesterday, two days after Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the
nation was considering diversifying more heavily into emerging-
market assets. China is also Taiwan’s biggest export market and
yesterday reported  imports  totaling $128 billion for
September, an all-time high.  “China buying more Asian assets will drive up
currencies,” said  Eric Hsing , a bond trader at First Securities
Inc. in Taipei. “If China buys more Taiwan goods, it would mean
a lot to the island’s economy.”  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.9 percent, the most since April
2009, to NT$30.689 against its U.S. counterpart as of 9:26 a.m.
local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency reached
NT$30.540, the strongest level since July 2008.  Taiwan’s  exports  gained 17.5 percent in September, an 11th
month of increase, the Ministry of Finance said on Oct. 7.
Shipments to China advanced 8.9 percent from a year earlier.  Benchmark 10-year bonds were steady. The yield on the 1.125
percent note due in September 2020 was 1.183 percent from 1.186
percent yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market, the
island’s biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
