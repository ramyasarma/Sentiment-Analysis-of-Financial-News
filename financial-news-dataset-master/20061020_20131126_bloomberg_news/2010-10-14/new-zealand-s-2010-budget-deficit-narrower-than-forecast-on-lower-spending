New Zealand’s budget cash deficit
was narrower than previously forecast in the year ended June 30
as the government reduced spending on capital projects.  The shortfall was NZ$9 billion ($6.8 billion) in the 2010
fiscal year, the government said in its financial  statements 
published in Wellington today. In May, the government estimated
the deficit was NZ$9.07 billion.  New Zealand’s budget slumped into deficit for the first
time in nine years in 2009 amid the global financial crisis, and
the gap is likely to widen to about NZ$13 billion in 2011,
Finance Minister  Bill English  said today. Central bank Governor
 Alan Bollard  this week said he is likely to increase the
benchmark interest rate gradually from historically low levels
to aid a “brittle” economic recovery.  “Expenditure has been flat, revenue has been falling,
deficits are increasing and debt will continue to increase,”
English told reporters. “New Zealanders are being very careful
with their spending. The recovery won’t be consumption-led.”  The 2010 deficit widened from NZ$8.64 billion in the year
ended June 30, 2009.  Today’s statements contained no forecasts. In May, English
said he expected the cash deficit to peak at a record NZ$13.33
billion in the year ending June 30, 2011.  Net Debt  Net debt increased to NZ$26.74 billion, or 14.1 percent of
gross domestic product, as of June 30 from 9.3 percent a year
earlier, the statements showed.  New Zealand’s economy expanded for a fifth quarter in the
three months to June, following five quarters of contraction.
Still, growth was 0.2 percent, less than a quarter of the pace
the central bank expected.  Bollard on Sept. 16 cut his 2010 growth forecast to 2.6
percent from 3.1 percent, and his 2011 outlook to 2.5 percent
from 3.8 percent.  The government’s December forecasts will be “unlikely to
contain any positive growth or revenue surprises,” English said
today.  “With the economy a bit flatter, it’s possible tax revenue
could be lower. At a time when we are very keen to see export
growth, we have China not keen to allow their currency to rise
and policy in the U.S. and U.K. leading to systematic
devaluations, making us less competitive,” English said.  Falling Revenue  Government tax revenue fell for a second year, reflecting
tax cuts and the effect of the recession on company profits and
employment, the Treasury Department said in today’s report. Tax
revenue fell to 26.8 percent of GDP from 29.6 percent a year
earlier.  Spending was little changed from a year earlier, when there
were some large one-time items, the department said. Excluding
those items, spending increased, it said.  The operating balance, excluding valuations of investments
held by the state-owned pension and insurance funds, widened to
NZ$6.3 billion from NZ$3.9 billion in 2009, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
