Beazley Plc , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, said co-founder and Deputy Chairman  Andrew Beazley  died
yesterday after a two-year battle with cancer.  Beazley, 57, founded the company in 1986 and was chief
executive officer for 22 years, the Dublin-based insurer said
today in a statement. He stepped down as CEO in 2008 after
contracting the disease.  “Andrew was a close friend and colleague to many of us,
and his inimitable humor, charisma and style will be remembered
by all of us,” said  Nick Furlonge , Beazley’s director of risk
management, who helped start the insurer.  Beazley and Furlonge began the company in a small office in
London with a borrowed computer, according to an obituary posted
on the insurer’s  website . The firm issued shares on the London
Stock Exchange in 2002 and is now the fifth-biggest publicly
listed Lloyd’s insurer, writing 1.12 billion pounds ($1.8
billion) of premiums in 2009. The firm sells insurance covering
risks including shipping, professional liability and terrorism.  Andrew Beazley was a member of the Lloyd’s Market Board
from 1994 to 1997, helping to oversee the payment of asbestos
claims that almost crippled the market in the early 1990s. He
also helped found the Franchise Board at Lloyd’s, which
increased oversight of insurers’ underwriting. Lloyd’s has had a
loss in just one year since the board’s creation in 2003.  In 2004, two years after the firm went public, Beazley
decided to sell insurance in the U.S. and expanded the division
to about a third of the company’s revenue.  Beazley was replaced as CEO by then Finance Director  Andrew Horton  in September 2008. He is survived by his wife and three
children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
