Soybeans rose to the highest level
since June 2009 on signs of increasing demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s largest grower and exporter.  U.S. producers of animal feed and vegetable oils increased
soybean use by 16 percent in September to 124.9 million bushels
from a year earlier, according to the National Oilseed
Processors Association. Exporters sold 280,000 metric tons of
soybeans to China for delivery in the year that began Sept. 1,
the Department of Agriculture said today.  “Demand is certainly not slowing, even with the jump in
prices,” said  Randy Mittelstaedt , the director of research at
 R.J. O’Brien & Associates  in Chicago. “Sales to China just keep
rolling in.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 12 cents, or 1
percent, to close at $11.99 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $12.05, matching
yesterday’s 16-month high. The most-active contract surged 23
percent in the third quarter. November soybeans, the contract
with the most volume, gained 12 cents to $11.885.  The dollar’s slump also boosted demand for commodities as
an alternative investment, Mittelstaedt said. Gold rose to a
record, and the greenback slipped to the lowest level since
December against a basket of major currencies on speculation
that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy further.  “The dollar’s weakness is driving money into
commodities,” Mittelstaedt said.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
