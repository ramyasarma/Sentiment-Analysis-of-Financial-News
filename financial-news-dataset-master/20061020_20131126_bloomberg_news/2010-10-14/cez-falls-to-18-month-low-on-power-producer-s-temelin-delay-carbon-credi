CEZ AS  fell for a third day, heading
for its lowest close in almost 18 months after saying yesterday
it will delay expansion of its Temelin nuclear power plant and
on speculation it may have to pay more for carbon credits.  The Czech Republic’s largest power producer  declined  1.6
percent to 790 koruna as of 11:35 a.m. in Prague. A close at
that level would be its lowest since April 23, 2009. Almost 1
million shares changed hands, or twice the daily average over
the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
