Taseko Mines Ltd. , awaiting Canadian
government approval for a copper project in British Columbia,
said it didn’t know why its shares dropped the most in three
months today.  Taseko, based in Vancouver, fell 73 cents, or 11 percent,
to C$6.21 at 4:20 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange composite
trading, the biggest one-day decline since July 5.  The shares 
earlier plunged as much as 34 percent, the largest intraday drop
since 1990.  Taseko is “unaware of any information that would cause the
price of the company’s stock to change materially,” the company
said today in a statement.  A mistaken trade may have triggered automatic selling of
the shares, leading to the price drop, said  Adam Graf , a New
York-based analyst at Dahlman Rose & Co. who rates the shares
“buy.”  “One fat finger can send a bunch of other guys into auto-
sells,” Graf said today in a telephone interview. “It doesn’t
mean they’re watching and re-buying at a lower level.”  The company is awaiting federal approval to develop its
Prosperity deposit, 125 kilometers (78 miles) southwest of
Williams Lake. The project would harm fish habitat, navigation
and land use by Indian groups, the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Agency panel said in recommendations to the
government posted on its  website  in July.  Canadian Fisheries and Oceans Minister  Gail Shea  hasn’t
issued a decision or set a deadline for a ruling on Prosperity,
Nancy Bishay, Shea’s spokeswoman, said today in a telephone
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
