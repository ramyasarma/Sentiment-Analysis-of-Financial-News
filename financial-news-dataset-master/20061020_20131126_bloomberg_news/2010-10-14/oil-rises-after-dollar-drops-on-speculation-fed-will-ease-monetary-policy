Oil advanced in New York after the
dollar declined against the euro as initial jobless claims rose,
adding to speculation U.S. efforts to ease monetary policy will
erode the value of the currency.  Futures retraced some of yesterday’s drop as the U.S.
currency fell versus most of its major counterparts on bets the
Federal Reserve will increase purchases of government debt in a
policy known as quantitative easing. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak today on monetary policy objectives and
tools in Boston.  “The Federal Reserve is trying to flush the system with
excess capital trying to get the economy up and running,”  Mike Sander  of Sander Capital Advisors in Seattle, said in an e-
mailed note today. “It’s clear the U.S. economy is still barely
holding on. I see the price of oil staying between the range of
$85 and $75 for the near future.”  The November contract gained as much as 28 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $82.97 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $82.91 at 9:33 a.m. Sydney
time. Yesterday it lost 32 cents to $82.69. Prices are up 0.3
percent for the week and 4.5 percent this year.  Bernanke said on Oct. 4 that the central bank’s first round
of large-scale asset purchases aided the economy and that
further quantitative easing is likely to help more.  The dollar traded little changed at $1.4075 a euro after
sliding 0.9 percent yesterday, when it touched $1.4122, the
weakest level since Jan. 26. A weaker U.S. currency increases
the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  Petroleum Demand  Oil slipped yesterday after a government report showed U.S.
petroleum demand dropped to the lowest level in more than 10
months. The Energy Department said  fuel consumption  fell 0.7
percent to 18.3 million barrels a day last week, the lowest
level since November. U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rose to
462,000 in the week to Oct. 9, a Labor Department report showed.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles decreased 1.77 million barrels to
218.2 million last week, the Energy Department said. They were
 forecast to slip  1.5 million barrels, according to the median of
19 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey before the report.  Crude inventories dropped 416,000 barrels to 360.5 million,
the report showed. Supplies were  estimated to jump  1.45 million
barrels, the Bloomberg News survey shows.  Brent crude for November settlement fell 11 cents, or 0.1
percent to $84.53 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London yesterday.  OPEC Meeting  Representatives from Venezuela and Libya at a meeting of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna said
oil at $100 a barrel would compensate producers for a slide in
the dollar without derailing the global economic recovery.  Crude at $90 to $100 won’t “harm” growth, Venezuelan
Energy and Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said.  Shokri Ghanem ,
chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corp., also called for higher
prices even as other nations said they were content with levels
of $70 to $85 a barrel.  OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of global crude
supply, agreed to leave oil-production quotas unchanged and
called on members to improve compliance with the group’s self-
imposed production limits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
