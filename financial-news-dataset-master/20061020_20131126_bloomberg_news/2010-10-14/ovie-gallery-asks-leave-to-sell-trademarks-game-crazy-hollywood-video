Movie Gallery Inc. , the video rental
chain that began shuttering its stores in February, asked for
bankruptcy court permission to auction off trademarks for
Hollywood Video, Movie Gallery, Game Crazy and Reel.com.  The company will sell all its remaining intellectual-
property assets, including domain names and customer databases,
according to court papers filed yesterday after business hours
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia.  “Millions of consumers have been renting their movies from
Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video for more than 20 years,”  Gabe Fried , founder and managing principal of the asset advisory firm
 Streambank LLC , said today in a statement. “These have proven
to be trustworthy brands.” Movie Gallery hired Streambank in
June, according to the statement.  Movie Gallery sought bankruptcy protection on Feb. 2, the
second time since 2007, and subsequently closed about 2,600
stores. The Dothan, Alabama-based chain got approval in July to
sell warehouse inventory.  The company listed debt of $500 million to $1 billion and
assets of as much as $50 million in Chapter 11 documents.  The case is In re Movie Gallery Inc., 10-30696, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).  To contact the reporter on this story:
