The Czech government won’t add two
new reactors to its Temelin Nuclear Power Plant by 2020 “at any
cost,” because of concerns about energy demand, said Industry
Minister Martin Kocourek.  “The predictions for energy demand, especially in the
Czech Republic, are not forcing us to finish Temelin at any
costs by 2020,” Kocourek said in an interview today.  He also said that CEZ’s profit and dividend for this year
may be lower in nominal terms, though the dividend ratio should
remain at 50 percent to 60 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
