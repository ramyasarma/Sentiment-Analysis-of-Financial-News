Reliance Industries Ltd. , India’s
most valuable company, raised $1.5 billion from its first
benchmark sale of bonds denominated in U.S. dollars, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company sold $1 billion of 10-year  notes  that yield 205
basis points, or 2.05 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries and $500 million of 30-year bonds at a
spread of 240 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , owns the
world’s largest refinery complex and has spent $3.4 billion
since April buying U.S. shale-gas assets. Ambani, ranked by
Forbes India as the nation’s richest person with $27 billion of
wealth, told shareholders in June that Mumbai-based Reliance is
planning “mega” investments in power generation as well as
expansion in telecommunications.  Proceeds from Reliance Holdings USA’s senior  unsecured
bonds , guaranteed by Reliance Industries, will be used to
refinance $765 million of loans for shale-gas ventures, for
general corporate purposes and for “further business
investments that may be pursued,” Moody’s Investors Service
said in an Oct. 4 statement.  Moody’s rated the new notes Baa2, its second-lowest
investment-grade  ranking , and Standard & Poor’s assigned them an
equivalent BBB.  Dollar Benchmark Debut  The sale was Reliance’s first benchmark-sized offering in
the U.S. currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company raised $162 million in 2007 from 6.24 percent notes due
in 2017, the data show. Benchmark sales are typically at least
$500 million.  The company tapped the dollar-denominated bond market as
issuance by non-U.S. companies takes the biggest share of sales
on record and investment-grade borrowing costs hover near a
record low.  So-called Yankee bonds have accounted for 43 percent of
sales this year, compared with 37 percent in 2009 and an average
23 percent from 1999 to 2009, Bloomberg data show. Yields on
investment-grade bonds were 3.57 percent yesterday after
tumbling to 3.56 percent on Oct. 8, the lowest since the daily
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index became
available in October 1986.  Reliance and its units have 509.9 billion rupees ($11.6
billion) of bonds and loans  maturing  through 2097, according to
Bloomberg data. They have 101.2 billion rupees of bonds
outstanding, the data show.  Bank of America Corp.,  Citigroup Inc. , HSBC Holdings Plc
and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  are managing the sale,
Reliance spokesman  Manoj Warrier  said on Oct. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
