speculation the Federal Reserve will pump cash into the economy.

has slumped against all 16 of its most-traded counterparts since
August on mounting speculation that the Fed will buy Treasuries
to suppress borrowing costs and bolster the recovery. The trade
deficit widened more than forecast to $46.3 billion in August.  “The data today, while not overly compelling, was a wake-
up call that the economy is losing momentum as we close out the
year,” said  Alan Gayle , senior investment strategist at
RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia, which
oversees $63 billion. “The market was not helped by the rise in
the trade deficit. This is a market that has been ignoring a lot
of troublesome economic reports and signs of fading momentum.”  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 81.48 yen and touched 80.89

countries like China in today’s trade-deficit report. The
