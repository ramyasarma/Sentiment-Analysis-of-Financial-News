Hog futures tumbled the most in 14
months on signs consumers are buying less pork during a seasonal
slowdown in demand. Cattle prices dropped.  The  wholesale-pork cutout , a weighted average of cuts
including bellies, ribs and hams, fell 2.2 percent yesterday to
81.11 cents a pound, the biggest decline in a week, according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The gauge is down 8.7
percent in October.  “Now that the weather’s getting into the fall, people
aren’t barbequing those cuts as much,” said  Tom Cawthorne , the
director of hog marketing at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in
Chicago. Pork cutout prices are falling on this drop in demand,
he said.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 2.85 cents, or 4
percent, to settle at 68.85 cents a pound at 1:10 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. That’s the biggest drop for most-
active contract since August 2009.  Earlier, futures touched 68.75 cents, the lowest level
since Feb. 17. The commodity is down 16 percent since June 30.  “Hog weights were up almost 2 pounds this last week,” and
ample supplies are also pushing prices down, said  David Kruse ,
the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in Royal, Iowa.  In the week ended Oct. 9, slaughtered hogs in Iowa and
southern Minnesota, the main producing region, weighed 272.6
pounds (123.7 kilograms), up 0.7 percent from a week earlier.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell 0.2 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 98.275 cents a pound. The commodity has gained 14
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement were
unchanged at $1.08125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
