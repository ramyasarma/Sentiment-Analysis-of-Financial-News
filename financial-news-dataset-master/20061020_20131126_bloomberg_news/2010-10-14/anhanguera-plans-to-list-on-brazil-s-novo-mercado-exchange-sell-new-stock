Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA , a Brazilian administrator of private universities, plans to
list its stock on the Novo Mercado section of the Sao Paulo
exchange and sell as many as 20 million new voting shares.  Anhanguera said it will  convert  each of its  preferred
shares  into one voting stock. Shareholders will then be offered
one voting share for each seven they already own, the company
said in a regulatory filing today. Shareholders will vote on the
plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
