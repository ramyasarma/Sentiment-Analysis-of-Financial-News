The Spanish government has suspended
its plan to reduce subsidies for wind energy as it seeks to
settle a pricing framework for all renewable power sources, El
Economista reported.   Industry ministry officials have removed details of the
subsidies, which were agreed with executives in July, from a
draft law which is being prepared for consideration by the
cabinet, the newspaper said, citing people in the wind industry
without naming them.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
