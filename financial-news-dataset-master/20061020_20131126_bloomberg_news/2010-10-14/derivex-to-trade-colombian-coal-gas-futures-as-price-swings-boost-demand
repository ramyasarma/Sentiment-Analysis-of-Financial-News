Derivex SA, Colombia’s only exchange
for energy futures, plans to begin trading contracts for coal
and natural gas over the next two years as price fluctuations
spur demand.  Bogota-based  Derivex  began trading electricity futures last
week as companies sought to lock in prices after dry weather
unexpectedly cut hydropower output early this year, Chief
Executive Officer  Alejandro Lucio  said today in an interview.  Colombia is luring more international investment in coal
mines, natural-gas fields and other projects as President  Juan Manuel Santos  boosts security by weakening guerrilla groups.  “The market is growing and investment from abroad is
fueling it,” Lucio said.  Rising production in Colombia of raw materials will
increase the need for futures contracts in the local currency as
producers and buyers hedge against price volatility, Lucio said.
Natural gas has slumped 33 percent this year in New York.  The company plans to begin trading options contracts for
electricity in 2012 and biofuel futures contracts in 2013, Lucio
said. Derivex also may trade credits for greenhouse-gas
emissions within three years, he said.  Derivex is owned by Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA, the
nation’s main stock exchange, and XM Cia. de Expertos en
Mercados SA, a unit of energy company Interconexion Electrica
SA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
