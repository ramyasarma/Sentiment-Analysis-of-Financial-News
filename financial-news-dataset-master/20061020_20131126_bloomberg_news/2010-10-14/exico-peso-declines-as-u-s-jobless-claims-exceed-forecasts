Mexico’s peso fell for the first
time in three days as jobless claims in the U.S., the nation’s
largest trading partner, unexpectedly climbed.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 12.4266 per dollar at 9:26
a.m. New York time, from 12.3839 yesterday. The decline pared
the currency’s gain this year to 5.3 percent against the dollar.  “You are going to get these dips in reaction to U.S.
data,” said  Aryam Vazquez , an economist with Wells Fargo & Co.
in New York. “The rally in the peso remains on track, given the
prevailing appetite for risk on the market.”  The number of Americans who filed initial jobless claims
unexpectedly increased by 13,000 to 462,000 in the week ending
Oct. 9, according to the Labor Department. Analysts had forecast
the number of claims would total 445,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S. purchases about
80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.28 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price fell 0.15 centavo to
134.81 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
