OAO Tatneft, an oil producer based
in Tatarstan, Russia, said first-half profit slumped 47 percent
because of higher taxes and transportation costs and foreign
exchange losses on debt.  Net income fell to 15.9 billion rubles ($528 million) from
29.7 billion rubles a year earlier, the company said today on
its website. Sales rose 31 percent to 215 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
