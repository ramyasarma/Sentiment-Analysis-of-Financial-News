China’s stocks are in a “solid bull
market” and the nation’s indexes may rise 20 percent in the
next six months, according to Robert Lutts, president and chief
investment officer of Cabot Money Management.  “I like growth in the economy, I like valuations and I
think profitability will be very strong,” Lutts, based in
Salem, Massachusetts, wrote in e-mailed comments. “I now have a
large weighting in China.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
