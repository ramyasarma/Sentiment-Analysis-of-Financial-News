OPEC decided to keep production
quotas unchanged following its meeting in Vienna today, group
President  Wilson Pastor  said.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
supplies 40 percent of the world’s oil, is benefiting as prices
stay above the $70-to-$80-a-barrel band that Saudi Arabian Oil
Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said is “ideal.” Several ministers said
the group will urge members to improve compliance to production
limits, which is at 54 percent of quotas, according to the 
Paris-based International Energy Association.   Crude climbed for a second day, rising as much as 1.3
percent to $84.12 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, extending a 1.6 percent gain yesterday. It
was at $83.27 a barrel at 12:06 p.m. London time.  OPEC will meet again on Dec. 11 in Quito, Ecuador, said
Pastor, who also is oil minister for that country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
