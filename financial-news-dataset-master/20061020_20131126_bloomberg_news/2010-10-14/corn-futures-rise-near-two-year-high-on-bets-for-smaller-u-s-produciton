Corn futures fell for a second-
straight day as dry weather allowed farmers to accelerate the
U.S. harvest and as the highest prices in two years encouraged
some investors to sell.  About 51 percent of the crop was harvested as of Oct. 10,
above the five-year average of 30 percent, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said. Hedge funds and other large traders held a
record bet on higher prices in the week ended Sept. 28, before
trimming positions last week, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Corn futures are up 37 percent this year.  “Harvesting is moving into the higher-yielding areas of
the Midwest,” increasing supplies available for sale by
farmers, said  Tim Hannagan , a market analyst for PFG Best Inc.
in Chicago. “Funds are using the rally to take profits after
the huge move higher.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.4
percent, to close at $5.6725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, capping the first two-day drop since
Oct. 1.  Prices earlier rose on speculation that the crop in the
U.S., the biggest grower and exporter, will be smaller than the
government forecast. Yesterday, corn reached $5.88, the highest
level since August 2008, before ending the day down 1.7 percent.  Smaller Harvest  Output will fall 3.4 percent from 2009, reducing reserve
inventories before next year’s harvest to 24 days of
consumption, the second-lowest level since 1962, the Department
of Agriculture said on Oct. 8. The estimated average yield per
acre was reduced by 6.7 bushels to 155.8 bushels from a month
earlier, the biggest-ever cut in the government’s forecast in
the month of October.  “Corn yields may fall toward 154 bushels,” increasing the
competition for U.S. supplies from exporters, feed manufactures
and ethanol makers, said  Randy Mittelstaedt , the director of
research for  R.J. O’Brien & Associates  in Chicago. “We are
going to have very tight supplies, and that means higher
prices,” Mittelstaedt said.  The USDA last week cut its forecast for the harvest to
12.664 billion bushels from 13.16 billion projected in
September. Flooding in June and hot, dry weather in August
damaged crops.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
