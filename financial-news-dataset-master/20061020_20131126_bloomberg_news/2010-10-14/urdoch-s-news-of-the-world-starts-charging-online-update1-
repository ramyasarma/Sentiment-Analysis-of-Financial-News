News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. tabloid  News of
the World  began charging for online access today, the third
British newspaper owned by media mogul  Rupert Murdoch  to erect a
paywall.  The weekly, known in the U.K. for exposing celebrity
scandals, re-launched its website and is charging 1 pound
($1.60) for 24 hours of access or 1.99 pounds for a four-week
subscription, according to a statement from News Corp.’s
international unit in  London . The move leaves Britain’s best-selling newspaper the Sun as News Corp.’s only U.K. national
title without a paywall.  News of the World follows the Murdoch-owned Times and
Sunday Times in charging online to offset falling revenue from
print advertising. Since the Times and Sunday Times sites
started paid-for access in July, there has been a decline in
advertisers and readers as people access free news elsewhere.  The tabloid’s redesigned website allows “digital customers
the chance to read the week’s biggest stories first, along with
exclusive video footage and pictures that won’t be available
anywhere else,” Editor  Colin Myler  said in the statement.  Readers will additionally receive access to
www.fabulousmag.co.uk, a new magazine section.  Users who register will also receive a 2-pound credit
redeemable on the site, to be spent on two 24-hour passes or for
unlimited access for the first four weeks should they choose to
sign up to a subscription.  An application for the tabloid for Apple Inc’s iPad will
follow shortly with a separate weekly charge of 1.19 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
