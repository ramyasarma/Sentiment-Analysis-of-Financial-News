The Serbian government approved
plans to sell a 51 percent stake in the national telephone
company Telekom Srbija AD in a tender by the first quarter of
next year, the prime minister’s office said today.  The government will open the sale on Oct. 19 with an
advertisement in an international newspaper and has accepted the
sale arranger’s evaluation that the company’s total value be set
at 2.43 billion euros ($3.42 billion). The government did not
announce a minimum price for the stake. Three people with
knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg earlier this week that
the stake would be offered at 1.4 billion euros.  Setting a minimum price would allow the government to raise
more cash as it struggles to cut the budget deficit with wage
reductions, lower subsidies to companies such as the state air
carrier and delays in infrastructure projects.  In July 2006, the government sold mobile operator Mobi 063
to Norway’s  Telenor  ASA for 1.5 billion euros, almost doubling
the minimum price in an auction after the tender.  Telekom Srbija, which is 20 percent held by  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization  SA, or OTE, will give away 6.52
percent of its equity to present and former workers, while 15
percent will be transferred “free of charge to citizens,” the
government said in an e-mailed statement.  In 2008, the government decided to give away 20 percent of
the capital in state-controlled assets to its citizens through
free shares, with almost 5 million Serbian citizens eligible for
shares in Telekom Srbija,  Naftna Industrija Srbije  AD (NIS),
Nikola Tesla Airport in Belgrade and Elektroprivreda Srbije
power monopoly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
