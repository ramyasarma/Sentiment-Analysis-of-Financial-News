U.S. auto sales may reach a 12.3
million annual rate in October, the fastest pace this year, Don
Esmond,  Toyota Motor Corp.’s  North American sales chief, said
today at an event in Detroit.  “The good news is last month was about 11.8 million,”
Esmond said. “So far this month, knock on wood, it could go
over 12.”  Esmond told reporters after the event that the  rate  may be
a seasonally adjusted 12 million to 12.3 million vehicles. The
pace would be the fastest since the end of the U.S. "cash for
clunkers" incentive program ended and a gain from the 11.8
million rate in September.  Toyota plans to introduce a new model of the Prius, the
top-selling hybrid, at the North American International Auto
Show in Detroit in January, he said, declining to comment
further. Toyota is the world’s largest seller of hybrid cars and
sells three fourths of the hybrids purchased in the U.S., Esmond
said.  Toyota’s American depositary receipts, each representing
two ordinary shares, rose $2.07, or 2.9 percent, to $72.37 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
receipts have dropped 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
