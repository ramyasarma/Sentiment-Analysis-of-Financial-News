Italy’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index
lost 0.2 percent to 21,094.86 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Autogrill SpA  (AGL IM) ended two days of losses, rising 1.3
percent to 9.09 euros. The world’s biggest manager of airport
and highway restaurants had its price estimate raised to 9.60
euros from 9.20 euros at UniCredit Research.  Banco Popolare Scrl  (BP IM) lost 1.3 percent to 4.27 euros,
the third decline this week. The lender should boost capital by
selling new shares to employees, UGL-Credito labor union head
Massimo Bernetti said in an interview.  The union is “cautious” about possible asset sales to
strengthen capital, Bernetti said. The bank would give its
employees more say in the company if it sold them a stake, he
said.  Bulgari SpA  (BUL IM) lost 2.2 percent to 7.23 euros,
snapping three days of gains. “The stock is pretty expensive,”
Fidentiis Equities SV SA wrote in a note.  Geox SpA  (GEO IM) dropped for a second day this week,
falling 1.2 percent to 4.21 euros. Intermonte Sim SpA reiterated
a “sell” rating on the Italian shoemaker that patented
ventilated soles, saying in a note that Geox is “still fighting
in a very competitive environment.”  Mediobanca SpA  (MB IM), Italy’s largest investment bank,
declined 1.1 percent to 7.06 euros, paring yesterday’s gain.
Banking shares were the worst performing industry in Europe.  Parmalat SpA  (PLT IM) increased 2 percent to 1.95 euros,
rising for a third day, as shares of Italy’s biggest dairy
company rose above their 100- and 200-day moving averages.  Pirelli & C SpA  (PC IM) added 1 percent to 6.34 euros, the
shares’ third straight gain. The tiremaker raised its forecasts,
saying it will generate more than 4.7 billion euros ($6.6
billion) in tire sales in 2010 and more than 4.9 billion euros
in total revenue.  Safilo Group SpA  (SFL IM) rose 3.1 percent to 11 euros, the
highest price since November 2008. Gruppo Banca Leonardo
increased its price estimate on the world’s second-largest maker
of glasses to 13 euros from 11 euros “ahead of expected good
third-quarter results,” the brokerage said in a note.  The shares of refiner  Saras SpA  (SRS IM) advanced 3.8
percent to 1.58 euros. Socar Trading SA, a unit of Azerbaijan’s
state oil company, wants to buy a refinery in Europe, Chief
Executive Officer  Valery Golovushkin  said yesterday. The company
has held talks with an Italian refiner about a 15 million-tons-
per-year plant, Golovushkin said, without naming the crude
processor.  Telecom Italia SpA  (TIT IM) advanced for a third day,
gaining 1.5 percent to 1.07 euros. Italy’s biggest phone company
said in a statement today that it has increased its stake in
Sofora Telecomunicaciones SA, which controls Telecom Argentina,
to 58 percent from 50 percent.  The news is “positive,” Credit Agricole Cheuvreux SA said
in a note. Barclays Plc reiterated an “overweight” rating on
the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
