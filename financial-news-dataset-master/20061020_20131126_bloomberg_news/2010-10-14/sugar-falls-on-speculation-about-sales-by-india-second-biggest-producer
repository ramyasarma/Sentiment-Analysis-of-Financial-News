Sugar futures fell in London and New
York on speculation of sweetener exports from India, the world’s
largest producer after Brazil.  The speculation on India centers on exports from a raw-
sugar import program last year, white sugar that was imported
from Brazil and Thailand this year and possible sales from last
year’s crop,  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers,
said. Raw sugar futures climbed 19 percent in the past year on
reduced crop prospects in Brazil, Pakistan and Russia.  “Certainly talk of any India sales is going to put a
temporary lid on the market, in London at least,” Beydoun said.
“The London market will not be as bullish as New York because
of speculation of white sugar sales.”  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 0.41 cent, or 1.5
percent, to 27.09 cents a pound at 7:54 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. White, or refined, sugar for December delivery
dropped $9.10, or 1.4 percent, to $691.60 a metric ton on NYSE
Liffe. Prices earlier today rose to $709.20, the highest price
for a most-active contract Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
