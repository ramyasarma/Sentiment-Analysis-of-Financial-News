TeliaSonera AB  and billionaire
 Mikhail Fridman ’s Alfa Group said they plan to appeal a Russian
court decision aimed at stopping the merger of their stakes in
OAO MegaFon, Russia’s third-largest wireless operator.  “We believe the decision was wrong and we still believe
our agreement is fully valid and enforceable and doesn’t
contradict Russian law,” TeliaSonera spokeswoman  Cecilia Edstroem  said today. The companies haven’t yet sought approval
for the deal from Russian authorities, she said.  Evgeny Dumalkin , a spokesman for Alfa’s telecommunications arm Altimo,
also said it disagrees with the decision and plans to appeal.  Stockholm-based TeliaSonera and Moscow-based Altimo agreed
last year to combine their stakes in  Turkcell Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS  and MegaFon to increase dividends and improve
corporate governance. The ruling is the second rejection of the
deal by Russian courts after OAO Telecominvest, a MegaFon
shareholder, sued in April to block the merger of the holdings,
citing a Russian law that bars state-controlled foreign
investors from taking control of strategic companies.  After a Moscow court ruled to nullify the deal, Russian
authorities referred the case to a different court, which handed
down the current decision, Edstroem said. TeliaSonera expects to
receive the decision in about a week, examine it and
subsequently appeal, she said.  No one at the press office of Moscow’s ninth arbitrary
court of appeal was immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
