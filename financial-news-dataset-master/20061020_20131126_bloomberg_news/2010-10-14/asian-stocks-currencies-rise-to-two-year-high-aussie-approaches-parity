The dollar weakened, touching a 15-
year low of 81 yen, after a report showed jobless claims
increased, fueling speculation the Federal Reserve will act to
shore up the economy.  Stocks  and U.S. futures erased gains.  The Dollar Index  sank  as much as 1.1 percent to the lowest
level in 10 months as the U.S. currency depreciated below 81 yen

percent. The  S&P GSCI  index of commodities climbed 0.4 percent.  The number of Americans filing first-time applications for
unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week,
indicating the U.S. job market is struggling to mend. The dollar
has slumped against all 16 of its most-traded counterparts since
August on mounting speculation that the Fed will pump cash into
the economy to bolster the recovery.  “The market is in a state of anxiety over what’s likely to
come from the Fed,” said  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London.  The dollar fell 0.8 percent to 81.19 yen from 81.81 yen in
New York yesterday, and touched 80.89 yen, the weakest since
April 20, 1995. The U.S. currency weakened to C$0.9981. The so-
called Aussie strengthened to 99.94 U.S. cents, the most since
exchange controls ended in 1983.  Jobless Claims  Jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 462,000 in the week ended
Oct. 9, from a revised 449,000 a week earlier, Labor Department
figures showed. Economists forecast claims would hold at
445,000, according to the median of 47 projections in a
Bloomberg News survey. Other data showed U.S. producers prices
rose in September and America’s trade deficit widened.  Singapore’s dollar appreciated to S$1.2963, after
appreciating to a record S$1.2893, after the Monetary Authority
of Singapore unexpectedly said it will steepen and widen the
band in which its dollar trades against a weighted basket of
currencies.  South Korea’s won  appreciated  to the strongest level since
May 3 after the central bank held off from raising interest
rates. China’s yuan advanced to its strongest level since 1993.
It rose 0.2 percent to 6.6508 per dollar, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.6503, the strongest
level since the central bank unified official and market
exchange rates at the end of 1993.  Criminal Gangs  Three stocks declined for every two the rose in Europe’s

Barrick Gold Plc tumbled 8.3 percent after criminal gangs
“widely infiltrated” a mine in Tanzania, forcing the company
to suspend 60 workers and delay production.  The S&P 500 closed yesterday at a five-month high.
 Yahoo! Inc.  jumped 14 percent in pre-market trading after the
Wall Street Journal reported that AOL Inc. and private-equity
investors including Silver Lake Partners and Blackstone Group LP
are exploring a deal to buy the owner of the second-most popular
U.S. Internet search engine.  Apollo Group Inc.  plunged 16 percent before the official

percent, bringing its two-day gain to 2.7 percent. The MSCI Asia
