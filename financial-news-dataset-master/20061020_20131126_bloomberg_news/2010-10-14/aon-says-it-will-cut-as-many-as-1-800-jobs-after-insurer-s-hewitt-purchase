Aon Corp. , the world’s biggest
insurance broker, plans to cut 1,500 to 1,800 jobs globally as
it integrates businesses after the acquisition of consulting
firm Hewitt Associates Inc.  The reductions and other expenses, including those tied to
real estate, will cost about $325 million, the Chicago-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. Aon said it expects
the integration to generate annual savings of about $355 million
in 2013.  Chief Executive Officer  Gregory Case  completed the $4.7
billion purchase on Oct. 1. The acquisition, Aon’s biggest,
added to the broker’s consulting businesses. Aon Hewitt, the
subsidiary created by Case to integrate the businesses, has
about 29,000 employees.  “There are going to be some redundancies as part of this”
acquisition, Case told analysts in a July conference call. “But
the focal point, our energies are really going to be around how
we build this and grow this.”  Aon’s expenses will be split between $180 million of
employee termination costs and $145 million to reorganize real
estate, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
