Slovenia will offer the construction
industry and its exporters 800 million euros ($1.12 billion) of
state guarantees to strengthen economic recovery.  “Considering the numerous investment projects in the near
future, the government has set up a guarantee plan that will
enable the Slovenian economy to win jobs outside the European
Union,” Finance Minister Franc Krizanic told reporters in
Ljubljana today. “Each company may get guarantees of as much as
300 million euros.”  The plan is targeted to help companies such as builder
 Slovenija Ceste Tehnika d.d.  complete a deal in Libya, Krizanic
said last month. Exports, mainly to the 27-nation bloc, make
about two thirds of the former Yugoslav nation’s total output.  The Alpine nation’s export-driven economy is expanding
again as demand for its manufactured goods in Europe
strengthens. Gross domestic product grew an annual 2.2 percent
in the second quarter and is set to advance 1.1 percent this
year before accelerating to 1.9 percent next year, according to
the latest outlook by the central bank in Ljubljana.  The main drag on the economic recovery is the struggling
construction industry, which powered growth before the start of
the global financial crisis. GDP advanced an average 4 percent
between 2001 and 2007, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
