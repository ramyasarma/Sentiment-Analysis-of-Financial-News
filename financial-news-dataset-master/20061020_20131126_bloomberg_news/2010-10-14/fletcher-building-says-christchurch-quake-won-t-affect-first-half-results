Fletcher Building Ltd., New
Zealand’s largest construction company, said it doesn’t expect a
“significant impact” on its first-half earnings because of
last month’s magnitude 7 earthquake in Canterbuty.  Trading since the Sept. 4 temblor has been quiet, Chief
Executive Officer Jonathan Ling said in presentation notes sent
to the stock exchange. Residential building activity is expected
to accelerate in the six months ending June 30, while commercial
and infrastructure repairs will take longer, the Auckland-based
company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
