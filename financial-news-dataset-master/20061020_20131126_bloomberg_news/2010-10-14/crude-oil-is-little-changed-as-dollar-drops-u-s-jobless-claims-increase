Crude oil fell after a government
report showed U.S. petroleum demand dropped to the lowest level
in more than 10 months as the economy struggled to recover.  Crude declined for a third day this week after the Energy
Department reported  fuel consumption  decreased 0.7 percent to
18.3 million barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 8, the lowest
level since the seven days ended Nov. 27. A Labor Department
report today showed U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly rose to
462,000 in the week to Oct. 9.  “The demand numbers were very weak,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “We
don’t really have a bull market unless we have stronger consumer
demand.”  Oil for November delivery fell 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
settle at $82.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier today futures rose to a one-week high of $84.12. Prices
have climbed 4.2 percent this year.  Brent crude for November settlement fell 11 cents to $84.53
a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  The Energy Department reported demand for gasoline
decreased 2 percent to 8.81 million barrels a day, the lowest
level since the week ended Feb. 12.  Oil also declined as the report showed crude  supplies fell 
416,000 barrels last week, less than the American Petroleum
Institute estimated yesterday.  Inventories Slip  U.S.  oil inventories  slipped 0.1 percent to 360.5 million
barrels, the department said, 13 percent above the five-year
average. They were forecast to rise 1.45 million barrels, based
on the median of 18 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The poll preceded the API report, which showed a decline of
4.01 million barrels, the biggest drop since July. The API is a
Washington-based industry group which collects stockpile
information on a voluntary basis from operators of refineries,
bulk terminals and pipelines. The government requires that
reports be filed for its weekly survey.  Gasoline inventories  fell 1.77 million barrels to 218.2
million, and distillate-fuel supplies, which include heating oil
and diesel, slid 255,000 barrels to 172.2 million.  “The inventories were certainly not as bullish as the API
data, so it was kind of a mixed bag,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York.  Weaker Dollar  Oil was higher earlier today as the dollar weakened against
other major currencies, boosting commodities’ appeal as an
alternative investment.  The  Dollar Index  slipped 0.6 percent to 76.619, extending
the currency’s decline to a third day. The index has fallen 1.1
percent since Oct. 11 amid speculation of quantitative easing by
the Federal Reserve, or debt purchases used to bolster the U.S.
economy.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Oct. 4 the central
bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases improved the
economy and that further buying is likely to help more.  People are speculating that the U.S. will ease monetary
policy, said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC in Houston. “This will make the dollar weaker and help
crude oil,” he said.  The dollar dropped 0.7 percent to $1.4055 against the euro
from $1.3961 yesterday. Earlier today, it touched $1.4122, the
lowest level since January on an intraday basis.  OPEC Meeting  Representatives from Venezuela and Libya at a meeting of
the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  in Vienna said
oil at $100 a barrel would compensate producers for a slide in
the dollar without derailing the global economic recovery.  Crude at $90 to $100 won’t “harm” growth, Venezuelan
Energy and Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said.  Shokri Ghanem ,
chairman of Libya’s National Oil Corp., also called for higher
prices even as other nations said they were content with levels
of $70 to $85 a barrel.  “No one will hate oil at $100,” Ghanem said. “The
weakening dollar is weakening our income.”  OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of global crude
supply, agreed to leave oil-production quotas unchanged and
called on members to improve compliance with the group’s self-
imposed production limits.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 666,214
contracts as of 3:01 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 762,074
contracts yesterday, 11 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.48 million contracts, the
highest level since May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
