             Shares of  Reed Elsevier Plc (REL) , the
owner of the LexisNexis database and Harcourt educational
publisher, rose after Credit Suisse analysts said the company
may become the target of a buyout firm.  
 ``We have screened the European media sector and Reed
scores highly for a leveraged buyout risk,'' analysts including
Robert Lambert wrote in a research note today.  
 London-based Reed has low debt, an ``attractive valuation
and strong free cash flow,'' which could provide a ``very
healthy return for a private equity investor,'' the analysts
said.  
 Shares of Reed Elsevier rose 7 pence, or 1.2 percent, to
582 pence in London, valuing the company at 7.4 billion pounds
($14.3 billion). The shares gained 2.7 percent last year.  
 Reed's education unit competes with McGraw-Hill Cos.,
Houghton Mifflin Co. and Pearson Plc in the markets for text
books, test marking and online materials. Reed Chief Executive
Officer Crispin Davis said in November the company is focusing
on the Internet for acquisitions.  
 Analysts said Jan. 5 that Reed could be a potential
takeover target of Amsterdam-based business publisher Wolters
Kluwer NV.
