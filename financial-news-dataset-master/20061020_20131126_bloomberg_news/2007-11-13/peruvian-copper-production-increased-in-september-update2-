             Peru 's  copper production  rose for a
seventh straight month in September as  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX)  tripled output at its Peruvian unit.  
 Production jumped 22 percent to 104,257 metric tons after
Phoenix-based Freeport, the world's second-biggest copper
company, completed an $850 million expansion at its Cerro Verde
mine, the Energy and Mines Ministry said today in an e-mailed
 statement .  
 ``The enormous investment here will give this deposit
another 20 years of life,'' Peru's President Alan Garcia said at
the  mine  in the southern Andean region of Arequipa. ``Cerro Verde
will now produce 25 percent of the country's entire copper
output.''  
 Peru, the world's third-largest copper and zinc producer and
No. 5 in gold, is counting on $13 billion in mining investments
to ensure annual  economic growth  of 7 percent in each of the next
four years.  
 Gold production  fell for a 15th straight month in September,
dropping 9 percent from a year earlier to 14,997 kilograms
(33,062 pounds), the ministry said. Output declined by one-fifth
at  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) 's Yanacocha mine.  
 Environmental protests forced Newmont to shelve a mining
expansion project in 2004 and shut down the mine twice in the
past 12 months.  
 ``Increasing social conflicts are creating obstacles for
mining projects in Peru,'' Jose T. Letelier, Barrick Gold Corp.'s
vice president for Latin America, said today at a conference in
 Lima . ``It's turning into a serious problem.''  
 Zinc, Silver Output Rise  
 Zinc production rose 15.3 percent to 114,640 tons, while
silver rose 18 percent to 328,202 kilograms. Lead and tin both
rose 14 percent to 29,083 tons and 3,369 tons, respectively.
Molybdenum output rose 15 percent to 1,613 tons.  
 Copper futures for December delivery were little changed at
$3.107 a pound on the Comex division of the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Zinc rose $9 to $2,640 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange. Tin fell $25 to $16,900 a ton.  
 Silver for December delivery fell 15.2 cents to $14.61 an
ounce on the Comex. Gold for December delivery fell $8.70 to
$799 an ounce.
