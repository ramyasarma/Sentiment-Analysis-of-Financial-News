             Washington Post Co. (WPO) 's Kaplan
education division agreed to buy two schools to expand its
business in  Australia .  
 The transactions are expected to close shortly, Kaplan said
in a statement today. Bradford College provides services for the
University of Adelaide and is located on the university's campus.
Grange Business School offers programs in accounting and
business. Financial terms weren't disclosed.  
 The acquisition will be Kaplan's third in Australia since
May 2006. The expansion of the test-preparation and training
business has enabled Washington Post to make up for a decline in
newspaper advertising revenue.  
 Sales at New York-based Kaplan, which accounts for about
half of the company's total revenue, jumped 23 percent to $503.5
million in the second quarter. Publishing revenue fell 7 percent
to $227.9 million.  
 Washington Post  shares  fell 28 cents to $792.47 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have risen 6.3
percent this year.
