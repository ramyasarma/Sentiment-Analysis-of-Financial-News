             Maanshan Iron & Steel Co. (323) ,  China 's
second-biggest Hong Kong-listed steelmaker, had the rating on
its stock raised by Credit Suisse Group, citing higher profit.  
 Maanshan Steel was raised to ``outperform'' from
``neutral,'' Hong Kong-based analysts Trina Chen and Mick Mi
said in a report today. Maanshan Steel's efforts to streamline
production of railway-carriage wheels will boost output by 50
percent by 2008, raising earnings 13 percent, the report said.  
 China plans to spend 100 billion yuan ($13 billion) by 2020
to extend its rail network by 35 percent, fueling demand for
carriage wheels. Domestic wheel demand is forecast to grow by 60
percent by 2010, Credit Suisse said. Maanshan currently holds
more than two-thirds of the market, it said.  
 Maanshan's ``key earnings support and surprise is likely
its wheel production,'' the analysts said in the report. ``We
expect the rail-wheel market to remain tight in the context of
China's railway expansion as well as upgrading demand.''  
 Profit from making the wheels rose to more than 4,000  yuan 
a ton last year from 600 yuan in 2004, Credit Suisse said. The
wheels accounted for 3 percent of Maanshan's output last year,
compared with an estimated 27 percent of company profit.  
 Maanshan stock  fell 0.2 percent to HK$4.57 in Hong Kong at
10:57 a.m. local time. The shares have gained 83 percent over
the past year. Credit Suisse has a share-price target of HK$5.90.  
 The brokerage raised the steel mill's rating to ``neutral''
from ``underperform'' on Oct. 19, citing an improved outlook for
steel prices and rising production capacity.
