             Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise,
owned by  Bank of China Ltd. , will buy 40 planes from Airbus SAS
and Boeing Co., as it expands its fleet to meet demand from low-cost carriers and other airlines.  
 Asia's  biggest  plane lessor ordered 20 planes from the A320
family, Airbus said in a statement today. The company also
exercised options for 20 Boeing 737-800s, Boeing said in a
separate release. The combined orders are worth as much as $3
billion at list prices.  
 Singapore Aircraft is expanding its fleet as customers such
as AirAsia Bhd., Southeast Asia's largest budget airline, start
flying new routes. The Asia-Pacific region will need 7,900
planes over the next 20 years, 29 percent of the global demand
for aircraft during the period, according to Boeing.  
 ``The pie is definitely growing for the low-cost segment,''
said Peter Drolet, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Hong Kong.
``You've now got a very tight small aircraft segment with
AirAsia and all the low-cost carriers that want to get their
hands on single-aisle aircraft.''  
 The orders are the first announced from Asia this year for
both Airbus and Boeing. Last year, Boeing booked a total of
1,044 orders for commercial airplanes. Airbus had 635 orders at
the end of November.  
 Singapore Aircraft plans to expand the number of planes it
owns and manages to as many as 300, Chief Executive Officer
Robert Martin said in a Bloomberg interview in September. At
present, it manages 12 aircraft for third parties out of the 75
in its fleet, according to its  Web site .  
 Sustained Demand  
 Singapore Aircraft ``has already placed almost all the
aircraft from its existing orders for delivery through to the
end of 2009, which is a measure of the sustained demand in the
leasing market'' Martin said in a statement today.  
 All 40 planes are scheduled for delivery between 2009 and
2012, Singapore Aircraft said. The company also has options for
10 more Airbus A320s. The purchases will be financed through
cash, bank loans and other facilities offered by the U.S. and
European export credit agencies, spokesman Sean Lee said in an
e-mail reply to Bloomberg queries.  
 Widebody Models  
 Singapore Aircraft is also evaluating further purchases in
the near future, including widebody models, it said today. The
company may seek offers for midsize planes such as the 787 or
A350 XWB, by the end of the first quarter, Flight International
said last week, citing Martin.  
 The agreement with Singapore Aircraft provides for the
option to convert to other variants within the 737 family,
Boeing said today.  
 The 737, which can carry as many as 215 passengers
depending on the model and has a maximum range 3,365 nautical
miles (6,232 kilometers), is powered by engines from CFM
International, a venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  France 's
Safran SA.  
 The plane lessor said it hasn't selected the engines for
the Airbus planes, which seat as many as 185 people and fly as
far as 3,700 nautical miles depending on the model.  
 Airbus won a total of 580 orders for its A320 family
aircraft as of the end of November, while Boeing had 729 orders
for the 737 aircraft for the whole of last year, according to
their Web sites.  
 Boeing said last week it booked a record 1,044 commercial
airplane purchases in 2006, benefiting from demand for cargo
planes and the 737 airliner. The 737 model accounted for about
three-quarters of 2006 deliveries.  
 Singapore Aircraft was acquired by Bank of  China , the
nation's second- biggest  bank, last month for $965 million. The
plane lessor posted a record profit of $34.7 million for the 12
months ended March 31, 2006, compared with $5.2 million a year
earlier, as growing travel demand spurred airlines to lease more
planes.  
 In April last year, Singapore Aircraft placed an order for
10 Boeing 737s with the option and purchase rights for 20 more.
