Sales of traditional German
Christmas decorations to the U.S. are rising because of the
improving U.S. economy and the euro’s decline, the industry
association said.  Exports to the U.S. of Christmas decorations from the
Erzgebirge region in eastern Saxony state will be worth as much
as 10 million euros ($12.5 million) this year, said Dieter
Uhlmann, the industry association’s head. That compares with 9.5
million euros in 2011, 9 million euros in 2010 and less than 6
million euros in 2009.  “The better economic situation in the U.S. is helping
sales, as is the weaker euro,” Uhlmann, director of the
 Association of Erzgebirge Artisans  and Toy Manufacturers, said
yesterday in a telephone interview from  Olbernhau , about 180
kilometers (110 miles) south of Berlin. “Our real crash in
exports to the U.S. was during the 2007-2008 crisis.”  The German Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, have been a
manufacturing center for Christmas decorations for the past 150
years, surviving two world wars and Cold War isolation under
communist East Germany until the 1990 reunification. Uhlmann
said his association has 62 members and the industry employs
about 2,000 people.  Nutcrackers  are the most popular holiday item among
American buyers and account for half of U.S. sales, with the
rest consisting of Christmas tree decorations and candle-driven
 revolving wooden pyramids , he said.  U.S. retail sales climbed more than forecast in July as
 consumer spending  rebounded. The 0.8 percent advance was the
first gain in four months. Goldman Sachs this month raised its
forecasts for U.S. economic growth this year and next.  The euro has declined 4 percent against the dollar this
year. It was little changed at $1.2474 at 11:12 a.m. in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
