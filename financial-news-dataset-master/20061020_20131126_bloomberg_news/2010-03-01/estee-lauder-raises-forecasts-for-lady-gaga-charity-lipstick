             Estee Lauder Cos., the maker of Mac
cosmetics, boosted its sales forecasts for a new lipstick
sponsored by singer Lady Gaga, boosting the U.S. company’s
contributions to AIDS programs.  
 Estee Lauder, which donates all the proceeds from Mac’s
Viva Glam range to the Mac AIDS Fund, last month added new
lipstick colors named for Gaga and fellow singer Cyndi Lauper.
Mac sold 30,000 of the items before the advertising campaign
began, Lauder’s Group President John Demsey said in an interview
today. That prompted the company to raise sales forecasts for
the Gaga color by $4 million to $5 million, he said.  
 Viva Glam, which went on the market in 1994 with Ru Paul as
spokesperson, posts average sales between $20 million and $25
million a year, according to Demsey. The Mac AIDS Fund is the
second-largest fundraiser for AIDS programs excluding
pharmaceutical companies, Demsey said.  
 “The combination of Gaga and Cindi, wacky girls who have
edge and personality, will be the most successful ever,” Demsey
said.  The company has 350 AIDS programs throughout the world,
according to Demsey. “We’ve been left with the responsibility of
being loud about this.”  
 Lady Gaga lipstick has outsold Lauper’s by 4 to 1 so far,
Demsey said. Viva Glam’s previous best-seller was a lipstick
sponsored by actress Pamela Anderson.  
 Mac sales have grown 25 times since 1998, and it is now the
fastest-growing cosmetics brand in Europe, Asia and the Middle
East, Demsey said.
