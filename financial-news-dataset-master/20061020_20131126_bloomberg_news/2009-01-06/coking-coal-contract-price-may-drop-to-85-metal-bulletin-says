             Coking coal contract prices may drop as
much as 72 percent to as low as $85 a ton this year as demand
dries up, Metal Bulletin reported, citing traders and analysts it
didn’t identify.  
 The consensus market forecast is about $140 a ton, the report
said. Record contract prices of $300 a ton in the year to April 1
were driven by floods in  Australia ’s Queensland state, a major
producer, which disrupted mining.  
 Market conditions have reversed, with a collapse in steel
demand and no significant supply disruptions, the report said.  
 Coking coal is used to make steel.
