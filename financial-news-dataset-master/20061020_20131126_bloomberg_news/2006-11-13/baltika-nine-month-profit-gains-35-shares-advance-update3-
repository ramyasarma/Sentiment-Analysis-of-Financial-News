             OAO Baltika Breweries,  Russia 's
largest beer company, said nine-month profit rose 35 percent
after acquisitions of three local competitors, sending the
shares to their biggest gain in eight months.  
 Net income climbed to 260.6 million euros ($335 million) as
revenue reached 1.34 billion euros, the St. Petersburg-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement that didn't give
year-earlier figures for revenue. Operating profit increased 46
percent to 354.4 million euros.  
 Baltika, which is jointly controlled by Carlsberg A/S and
Scottish & Newcastle Plc, in July completed takeovers of brewers
Pikra, Vena and Yarpivo, giving it respective 92 percent, 97.5
percent and 91.4 percent stakes. The company, which controls 36
percent of Russia's beer market, will own 10 plants in nine
regions of the country after the merger closes this year.  
 ``The so-called cross-brewing allowed it to use the plants'
full capacity and widen its distribution network,'' Ivan
Nikolayev, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow with a
``buy'' recommendation on Baltika, said of the company.  
 The shares rose 45.60 rubles, or 4.3 percent, to 1,110.25
rubles on the Micex Stock Exchange at the close of trading in
Moscow, reaching the highest since April 21 and posting the
biggest one-day gain since March 16.  
 Excise Stamps  
 The company increased the amount of beer it sold by 8.8
percent to 28.2 million hectoliters (23.6 million barrels) in
2006's first nine months, in line with the market's 9 percent
expansion. One hectoliter equals 100 liters.  
 Third-quarter sales surged as excise stamps were introduced
for imported spirits and wine in Russia, slowing sales of those
products, Baltika said. The disruption allowed the company to
raise sales 15 percent in the period, while total beer sales in
Russia climbed 14 percent.  
 Baltika also said it has raised its share of Russia's
licensed beer segment by 2.2 percent to 22 percent. Sales of
beer more than doubled under each of the Tuborg, Foster's and
Kronenbourg 1664 brands. Baltika's share of the Russian market
for premium beers rose to 44 percent.  
 The company raised the amount of beer it exported by 12
percent to 1.3 million hectoliters in the year's first nine
months. Sales in Ukraine gained 17 percent, lifted by the
beginning of licensed production of Baltika beer by Ukrainian
company Slavutich at the beginning of the year.  
 Planned Expansion  
 ``To keep their market share, they need to rise faster than
the market,'' Nikolayev said. ``They are building new facilities
and widening geographical coverage, and that is positive.''  
 Baltika has said it plans to spend $125 million to triple
capacity at its Samara plant in central Russia to add 4.5
million hectoliters to overall annual capacity of 40 million.
This year it has doubled capacity at a plant in Chelyabinsk in
the Urals to 4.5 million hectoliters, spokesman Alexei Kedrin
said today in a telephone interview from St. Petersburg.  
 The company is considering constructing a brewery in
Novosibirsk and will make a decision within two months, Kedrin
said, citing Baltika President Anton Artemiev. The plant, to be
completed by spring 2008, will have annual capacity of at least
2 million hectoliters and will cost at least 70 million euros.
