             Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA , the
biggest Peruvian precious-metals producer, said second-quarter
profit increased 10 percent on higher gold prices.  
 Net income rose to $134.4 million, or 53 cents a share,
from $121.7 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier, Lima-based
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. The company
was expected to report profit excluding some items of 46 cents,
the  average estimate  of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The company’s profit rose after it sold gold for an
average of $919 an ounce in the quarter, 3 percent more than a
year earlier. Higher prices offset a drop in gold and silver
output from its wholly owned operations, said Alonso Aramburu,
a strategist with Santander Investment Securities.  
 It was “an improved quarter on lower costs and better
prices,” Aramburu said in an e-mailed response to questions
before the results were released. “But nothing spectacular,
since production increases will not come until 2010.”  
 Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, which each
represent one ordinary share, rose 76 cents, or 3.1 percent, to
$25.02 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
results were released after the close of trading on North
American stock markets. The ADRs have gained 26 percent this
year.  
 Total gold output in the quarter including its 44 percent
stake in Denver-based  Newmont Gold Corp. (NEM) ’s Yanacocha gold mine
increased 10 percent to 325,000 ounces, while silver production
fell 6 percent to 3.7 million ounces. Copper fell 2 percent,
while zinc and lead rose 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively,
Buenaventura said.  
 Falling Costs  
 General and administrative expenses fell 4 percent to
$35.8 million in the first half, while exploration spending was
cut by 37 percent to $17 million, Buenaventura said.  
 Income from minority interests, including Yanacocha and a
19 percent stake in Phoenix-based  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc.’s (FCX)  Cerro Verde copper mine, was little changed at
$98.3 million. Lower copper prices at Cerro Verde offset a 23
percent production gain at Yanacocha.  
 Buenaventura’s earnings growth may slow as production
declines on a lack of new deposits, said JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analyst John Bridges, who rates the shares “neutral”.  
 “Gold production should be stable for the next two years,
but is vulnerable in coming years,” Bridges wrote in a July 13
note to clients.  
 Production Decline  
 Production at Yanacocha will drop to 1.6 million
ounces this year from 1.8 million ounces in 2008, Chief
Executive Officer Roque Benavides said June 17. Buenaventura
aims to start up its La Zanja and Tantahuatay gold mines in
2010 and 2011, respectively, he said.  
 Peru is the third-largest copper producer and the fifth-
biggest miner of gold.
