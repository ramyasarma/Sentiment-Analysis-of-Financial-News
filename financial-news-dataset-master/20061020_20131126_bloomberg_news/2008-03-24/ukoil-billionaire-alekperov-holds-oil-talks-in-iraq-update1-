             Vagit Alekperov, the billionaire
chief executive officer of Russian oil producer OAO Lukoil, flew
to Iraq for talks on reviving a contract to develop one of the
country's largest fields.  
 Alekperov is holding talks with Iraqi officials today on the
West Qurna-2 deposit, Lukoil spokesman  Dmitry Dolgov  said by
phone in Moscow, declining to elaborate because of security
concerns. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari invited Alekperov
in February.  
 Lukoil has lobbied the Iraqi government to renew the
concession, awarded when  Saddam Hussein  ruled the country, and to
let it develop the field with U.S. partner  ConocoPhillips. (COP)  Iraq's
government said in December that Russia's biggest independent oil
company, will have to bid again for West Qurna-2 after a new law
governing the nation's oil industry is passed.  
 West Qurna-2 holds about 6 billion barrels of oil, according
to Lukoil estimates. By comparison, Iraq, holder of the world's
largest oil reserves after neighbors Saudi Arabia and Iran, holds
a total of 115 billion barrels, according to BP Plc's Statistical
Review of World Energy.  
 Russia agreed to write off $12 billion of Iraqi debt during
Zebari's visit to Moscow last month, a move Russian Finance
Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said would lead to increased Russian
investment in the Persian Gulf country.
