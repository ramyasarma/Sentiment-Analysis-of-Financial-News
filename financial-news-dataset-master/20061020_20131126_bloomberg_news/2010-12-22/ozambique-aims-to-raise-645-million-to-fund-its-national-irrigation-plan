Mozambique’s government plans to
raise $645 million by 2019 to finance a national irrigation
project, according to a statement issued after a Cabinet meeting
yesterday.  The government has already secured $135 million and plans
to raise another $510 million, Alberto Nkutumula, Cabinet
spokesman, said in the statement. Work on the irrigation plans
will start next year, he said.  Mozambique has 62,000 hectares (153,000 acres) of irrigated
land out of a possible 33 million hectares, Nkutumula said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
