Gold futures fell as U.S. equities
climbed to a two-year high, eroding the appeal of the precious
metal as an alternative asset.  Stocks and Treasury yields rose after a report showed the
U.S. economy in the third quarter expanded faster than the
government estimated and inflation unexpectedly cooled. Gold has
gained 27 percent this year, reaching a record on Dec. 7, as the
Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate close to zero
percent.  “If the stock market rally continues, gold will flatline
or go negative,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services in Chicago.  Gold futures for February fell $1.40, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,387.40 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price has dropped 3.1 percent from the record $1,432.50.  Losses were limited on speculation that Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis will spread. Gold priced in euros also reached a
record on Dec. 7. The cost of insuring Greek debt jumped to a
four-week high after Fitch Ratings warned it may cut the
nation’s credit rating to junk.  The International Monetary Fund said yesterday it concluded
the planned sale of 403.3 metric tons, or 13 percent of its gold
reserves.  “Support will come from the completion of the IMF’s gold
sales, a bullish year-end seasonal pattern and ongoing worries
over European sovereign debt,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF
Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said in a report.  ‘Reduced Supplies’  Investors may interpret the IMF sale “to be an indication
of reduced supplies from the official sector,” Pawlicki said.  Silver futures for March delivery were little changed at
$29.385 an ounce. The metal has jumped 74 percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $2.10, or 0.3
percent, to $755.15 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Platinum futures for April delivery climbed $8.70, or 0.5
percent, to $1,735.80 an ounce.  Palladium has surged 85 percent this year, and platinum was
up 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
