The number of U.S. homeowners who
qualified for permanent loan modifications through a federal
program topped 500,000 in November for the first time, remaining
short of the Obama administration’s goal of 3 million.  Permanent modifications in the Home Affordable Modification
Program, known as HAMP, totaled 504,648 in November, up 4
percent from October, the Treasury Department said today. Almost
30,000 borrowers qualified for permanent HAMP modifications in
the month, while 8,666 modifications were canceled. The loan
changes reduced monthly mortgage payments to 31 percent from an
average 45 percent of borrowers’ income.  HAMP, a $50 billion program authorized by Congress in 2009,
aims to reduce foreclosures by paying lenders and servicers to
rewrite loan terms for borrowers who can’t make their mortgage
payments. The program is ineffective and failed to hold mortgage
companies accountable, the Congressional Oversight Panel for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program said in a Dec. 14 report.  “It’s definitely fallen short of expectations,” Stan
Humphries, chief economist of Seattle-based Zillow Inc., said in
a telephone interview. “But it’s better than doing nothing.”  There have been 1.43 million trial modifications started
since the program began last year. About 46 percent of those
have been canceled because borrowers fell behind in payments or
failed to comply with program requirements.  Private Modifications  The program has succeeded in spurring mortgage servicers to
offer their own modifications to struggling homeowners, said
Theresa Schrettenbrunner, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo & Co.
More than 100,000 homeowners received modifications in November
through the HOPE Now Alliance, a group of three dozen private
lenders, according to a separate Treasury Department report
today.  “It absolutely helped to pave the path so more
modifications were possible,” Schrettenbrunner said in a
telephone interview today from Des Moines, Iowa.  About 86 percent of 600,000 Wells Fargo customers had
modifications through proprietary modification programs through
November, the San Francisco-based bank said in a statement
today.  Wells Fargo reached an agreement with California Attorney
General Jerry Brown to forgive about $2 billion in principal on
an estimated 14,900 home loans with pay-option adjustable rates,
the company said Dec. 20.  Bank of America Corp. has completed 652,000 modifications
through non-government programs since 2009, compared with 93,500
through HAMP, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender said in
a statement today. The bank had an estimated 425,300 loans at
least 60 days delinquent as of Oct. 31, according to data from
the Treasury Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
