Gold may climb to $1,480 an ounce,
after breaking through record levels set this month, according
to technical analysis by Barclays Capital.  A recent dip was a “healthy correction” and levels above
the $1,350 area provided a base for gains to initial targets of
$1,460 to $1,480 an ounce based on Fibonacci projections and
rising trendline resistance, Barclays analysts wrote in a report
dated Dec. 17.  Gold for immediate delivery reached a record $1,431.25 an
ounce on Dec. 7 before dropping to $1,361.39 on Dec. 16, the
lowest level since Nov. 29. The precious metal is heading for a
10th annual gain as debt concerns in Europe and monetary
stimulus in the U.S. boost demand for bullion.  A resistance level is where there is expected to be a
cluster of sell orders. Fibonacci analysis is based on the
theory that prices drop or climb by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
