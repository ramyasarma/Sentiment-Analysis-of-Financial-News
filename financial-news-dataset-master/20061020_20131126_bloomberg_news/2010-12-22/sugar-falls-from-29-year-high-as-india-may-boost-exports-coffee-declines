Sugar prices rose for the fourth
straight session on speculation that India, the world’s second-
biggest producer, may delay new exports. Arabica coffee dropped
from the highest in 13 years.  The Indian government will review its export policy at the
end of January, Farms Minister  Sharad Pawar  said last week. The
government had authorized 500,000 metric tons for export amid
projections that output will exceed consumption for the first
time in three years. Sales from India have been regulated since
2009. Earlier, prices fell as much as 2.9 percent.  “Any decent pullback will most likely find buying support
as the supply situation from Brazil and India is thin,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge USA, said in a
report. “It looks like India could delay releasing exports.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.11 cent, or 0.3
percent, to close at 33.13 cents at 2 p.m. on ICE Future U.S.
The price gained 6.9 percent in four sessions and yesterday
reached 33.65 cents, the highest for a most-active contract
since January 1981. Brazil is the biggest producer.  “The supply situation could be tight until the Brazilian
new crop makes its expected delayed appearance in late April or
early May,” McDougall said. Freezing weather may hurt output in
the European Union, he said.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery dropped
$25.80, or 3.2 percent, to $784.50 a ton on NYSE Liffe.
Yesterday, the price reached $815, the highest since at least
January 1989.  Coffee, Cocoa  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 3.65 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $2.302 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the price
jumped to $2.4225, the highest since June 1997.  Coffee has surged 69 percent this year, partly on concern
that heavy rains curbed supplies in Brazil, the largest
producer.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for March delivery
advanced $2, or 0.1 percent, to $2,012 a ton.  Cocoa futures for March delivery dropped $5, or 0.2
percent, to $2,970 a ton in New York. In London, the March
contract was little changed at 2,009 pounds ($3,088 a ton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
