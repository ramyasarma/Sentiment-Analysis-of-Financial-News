Tonight’s sold-out performance of
“ Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark ” was canceled, two days after a
performer was seriously injured in an unscripted fall. A matinee
performance already had been dropped.  Earlier today, New York State Labor Department safety
inspectors met with staff members of the problem-plagued $65-
million musical. They agreed to implement additional procedures
to prevent more accidents.  “If they’re not comfortable and haven’t gotten everything
in place, they wouldn’t go,” Maureen Cox, the Labor
Department’s Director of Safety and Health, said in a conference
call with reporters this afternoon.  “Spider-Man” spokesman Rick Miramontez said “additional
protocols” will be rehearsed today and this evening.  Each cancelled performance costs the producers about
$186,000 in lost ticket revenue, according to box office figures
supplied by the theater. That does not include overtime for
actors, stagehands and other personnel involved in the
production.  The show’s official opening has been postponed twice. It is
currently scheduled to open on Feb. 7.  To contact the writer on this story:
