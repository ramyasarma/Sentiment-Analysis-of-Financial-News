Brown-Forman Corp. , the maker of
Jack Daniel’s whiskey, said it may sell a piece of its wine
business, including Fetzer, as part of a strategic review.  The wines being considered for sale are based in Hopland,
California, Brown-Forman said today in a statement. The review
does not include the Sonoma-Cutrer brand or a 45-year-old
contract to market and sell Korbel California Champagnes.  Brown-Forman’s wine unit accounted for $310 million in
sales in the year ended April 2010, compared with spirits sales
of $2.9 billion, according to company filings. Phil Lynch, a
spokesman for Louisville, Kentucky-based Brown-Forman, declined
to break out sales of the brands being reviewed.  Fetzer is considered a mid-priced brand, selling for $7 to
$10 a bottle, Lynch said today in an e-mail. Brown-Forman shed
its Bolla and Fontana Candida Italian Wines in 2008 to focus on
faster-growing and more profitable brands.  Brown-Forman, led by  Chief Executive Officer Paul Varga ,
rose 9 cents to $70.55 at 12:18 p.m. today in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had risen 32 percent this
year before today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
