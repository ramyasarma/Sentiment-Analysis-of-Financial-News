Navistar International Corp. , a
maker of commercial and military vehicles, said it is the
subject of five lawsuits that could be granted class-action
status stemming from “design and manufacturing defects” in
truck engines it made for  Ford Motor Co.   Navistar said today in a  regulatory filing  Brandon Burns
sued last month in California seeking class-action status for
owners and lessees of Ford vehicles with Navistar 6-liter power
stroke engines for the model years 2003 through 2007. Four other
lawsuits have since been filed seeking class status in Utah,
Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi.  Separately, Navistar said in statement that profit in the
quarter ended Oct. 31 fell to $39 million, or 54 cents a share,
from $86 million, or $1.19 a share. Excluding charges of $10
million, or 14 cents a share, in costs related to severance,
layoffs and a new labor agreement, profit was 68 cents a share.
Analysts projected 59 cents, the average of 13  estimates .  Sales rose 2.6 percent to $3.37 billion, exceeding the
$3.25 billion average of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Navistar  fell  $2, or 3.4 percent, to $57.17 as of 4:03 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since
Oct. 19. The shares have gained 48 percent this year.  “The stock’s had a great run so it’s not unusual to see a
little profit taking,”  Stephen Volkmann , an analyst with
Jefferies & Co. in New York, said today in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
