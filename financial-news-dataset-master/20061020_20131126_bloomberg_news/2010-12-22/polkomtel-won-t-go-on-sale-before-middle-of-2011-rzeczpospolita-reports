Polkomtel SA, Poland’s largest
mobile-phone company, can’t go on sale before the middle of 2011
because the supervisory board hasn’t approved a share sale plan,
 Rzeczpospolita  reported, citing unidentified persons.  The company’s supervisory board yesterday failed to approve
an initial schedule for selling the owners’ shares, making the
end of January or early February the most realistic date for
sending a memorandum to potential investors, the newspaper said.  Polkomtel’s owners include  Vodafone Group Plc ,  PKN Orlen
SA ,  KGHM Polska Miedz SA  and  PGE SA .  To contact the reporter on this story:
