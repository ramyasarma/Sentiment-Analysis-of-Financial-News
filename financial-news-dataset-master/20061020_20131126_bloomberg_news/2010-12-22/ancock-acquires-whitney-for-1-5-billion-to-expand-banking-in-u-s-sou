Hancock Holding Co.  agreed to buy
Whitney Holding Corp., the New Orleans-based bank that lends to
the oil and gas industries, in a stock swap initially valued at
$1.5 billion to expand in the U.S. South.  The offer for  Whitney  is worth $15.48 a share, 42 percent
more than yesterday’s closing price, Gulfport, Mississippi-based
Hancock said today in a statement. Investors will get 0.418
Hancock share for each Whitney’s, according to terms of the
exchange.  Hancock is expanding in states including Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas after bailed-out Whitney sold
nonperforming loans and was hurt by the Gulf Oil spill. The
combined institution will have about $20 billion in assets and
305 branches. Five Whitney directors will join the  Hancock board 
at the completion of the purchase, which is expected in the
second quarter of 2011.  “It’s beginning of the wave of consolidation that’s
expected in this industry,” said  Richard Bove , the analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, who included Whitney
on his list of takeover targets in September.  The price equals 103 percent of Whitney’s book value,
compared with an average of 110 percent for the 445 lenders in
the Nasdaq Bank Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The 42 percent premium is less than the 54 percent average among
U.S. regional banks in the past 12 months.  Stock Rises  Whitney advanced $3.13, or 29 percent, to $14 at 4:30 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading , bringing its gain
to 54 percent this year. Hancock slid $2.46, or 6.6 percent, to
$34.58. The stock is down 21 percent in 2010.  The deal combines “two similarly sized companies with
complementary cultures,” Whitney Chief Executive Officer  John Hope  said in the statement.  Hancock plans to repurchase the $300 million of preferred
shares and the warrants that were sold the U.S. by Whitney under
the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Morgan Stanley advised
Hancock and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal
counsel. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Alston & Bird LLP advised
Whitney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
