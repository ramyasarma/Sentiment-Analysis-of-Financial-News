China’s stocks  fell, led by
producers of consumer staples and banks, after the government
raised fuel prices and concern grew over lenders’ profitability
as the government tightens monetary policy.  Kweichow Moutai Co.  sank to a one month-low amid
speculation energy costs for companies will rise, damping
earnings growth, after China increased the price of  gasoline  and
diesel for the third time this year.  Agricultural Bank Of China
Ltd.  lost 0.8 percent after Barclays Capital said the
government’s higher requirements on loans to local governments
will cut lenders’ capital adequacy ratios and profits.  “Higher oil prices may spur faster inflation, adding to
investor concerns about future policy tightening,” said  Zhang Kun , a strategist at Guotai Junan Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The  Shanghai Composite Index  retreated 26.22, or 0.9
percent, to 2,877.90 at the 3 p.m. close, the fifth decline in
six days. The gauge climbed 1.8 percent yesterday as military
tensions on the Korean peninsula eased. The  CSI 300 Index  fell
1.1 percent to 3,215.45.  The Shanghai Composite is Asia’s worst performing stock
gauge this year with a 12 percent loss amid concern monetary
tightening will slow economic growth and damp earnings. The
government has ordered banks to set aside more money as reserves
and raised interest rates to cool inflation and surging property
prices that were spurred by record credit growth in 2009.  A  gauge  tracking consumer staples declined 1.3 percent, a
fourth day of declines and the second-biggest loss among the CSI
300’s 10 industry groups.  Fuel Prices  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest liquor maker by market
value, slumped 1.6 percent to 190.95 yuan, set for the lowest
close since Nov. 23. Tsingtao Brewery Co., the second-biggest
brewery by volume, dropped 2 percent to 35.79 yuan. Shenzhen
Agricultural Products Co. slipped 3.6 percent to 18.46 yuan.  Gasoline will rise by as much as 4 percent to 310 yuan a
metric ton and diesel by 300 yuan a ton, the National
Development and Reform Commission said. Crude in New York has
gained 9 percent since China last increased prices on Oct. 26.  “This is a long-delayed move as the government is
concerned about inflation while refiners are suffering losses
after crude costs soared,” said Hei Wei, an oil analyst with
BOCOM International Holdings Co. in Beijing. “We think the 4
percent increase is far from enough to offset crude gains.”  China’s two largest refiners reversed earlier gains.  China
Petroleum and Chemical Corp.  fell 0.4 percent to 8.23 yuan after
advancing as much as 2.4 percent. PetroChina Co. erased an
increase of 2.2 percent to trade 0.7 percent lower at 11.44 yuan.  Food Prices  Inflation  in China accelerated to 5.1 percent last month
from a year earlier, the biggest jump in 28 months. Chinese
consumers are more concerned about rising prices than at any
time in the past decade, the People’s Bank of China said on Dec.
15 in its quarterly survey of 20,000 households.  The stock measure tracking consumer staples producers has
rallied 17 percent this year as food prices surged and investors
sought companies most sheltered from inflation. Food inflation
reached 10 percent in October, more than twice the 4.4 percent
headline rate.  China’s stocks are poised for a “very strong” 2011 as
food prices ease by April, said  Donald Straszheim , director of
China research at International Strategy & Investment Group.  “By March or April, China food prices will be off the
front pages; and the active monetary tightening will be off the
front pages as well,” he wrote in a report. “That will set up
China equities, sideways of recent, volatile and scary-headline
driven, for a very strong 2011.”  The index tracking financial companies slid 1.6 percent,
the biggest drop on the CSI 300 and extending a 24 percent rout
this year that was spurred by tighter curbs on lending.  Bank Loans  The China Banking Regulatory Commission may require lenders
to assign 100 percent risk weightings for loans fully covered by
cash flows, up from the current 50 percent, and as much as a 300
percent for uncovered loans, Barclays said in a note today,
citing a China Business News  report  published yesterday. The
risk-weighting rule has already been made official, the note
said, citing unidentified banks.  Agricultural Bank, the nation’s third largest by assets,
lost 1.1 percent to 2.62 yuan, the biggest drop since Dec. 8.
 China Construction Bank Corp.  declined 0.4 percent to 4.70 yuan,
extending a 22 percent plunge in 2010.  Agricultural Bank  will be hurt most by the change, Barclays
analysts  May Yan  and  Allen Zhang  wrote. The government is trying
to limit risks stemming from last year’s surge in loans to
local-government finance vehicles for roads, bridges and
railroads. Chinese banks may struggle to recoup about 23 percent
of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.2 trillion) credit they’ve extended,
a person with knowledge of data collected by the industry
regulator said in July.  -- Irene Shen . With assistance by  Winnie Zhu  in Shanghai.
