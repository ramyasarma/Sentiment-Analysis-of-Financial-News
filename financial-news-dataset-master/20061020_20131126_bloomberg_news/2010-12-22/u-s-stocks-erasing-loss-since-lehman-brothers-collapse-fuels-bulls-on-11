The advance that lifted the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index above its level before the collapse of  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.  in September 2008 is an encouraging sign
for bulls, technical analysts said.  The benchmark gauge for American stocks rose 0.6 percent to
1,254.6 yesterday, surpassing its closing level of 1,251.70 on
Sept. 12, 2008, the last trading session before Lehman Brothers
filed the world’s biggest bankruptcy. After closing within 1
percent of the milestone on five of the six previous days, the
index may now have room to rise, according to analysts who base
forecasts on price charts.  “It’s a psychological and technical victory for the
market,” said  Christopher Verrone , lead technical analyst at
New York-based Strategas Research Partners. “It strengthens the
case that 2011 might be better than a lot of people expect.”  U.S. government and Federal Reserve spending to stimulate
the economy and 70 percent of S&P 500 companies  beating  profit
estimates for a record six straight quarters pushed the S&P 500
up 85 percent since March 2009. The index will end 2011 at 1,374,
according to the average projection of 11 strategists at Wall
Street’s biggest banks, producing the biggest three-year rally
since 1997-1999.  Losses for the  S&P 500  totaled 46 percent between Lehman’s
failure and March 9, 2009, as the worst recession since the
1930s intensified. The index started to rebound three months
before the contraction ended in June 2009, according to the
National Bureau of Economic Research. It has to climb 25 percent
to surpass its October 2007 record high of 1,565.15.  ‘Starting Gun’  In the week of Lehman’s bankruptcy, Bank of America Corp.
took over Merrill Lynch & Co. as it teetered on collapse and the
government seized American International Group Inc. The S&P 500
surged in the final two days of that week after the government
announced a plan to purge banks of bad assets and crack down on
short sellers.  “Lehman Brothers was really the starting gun for creating
this sense of fear, and we still haven’t fully overcome that
fear but we’re in a healing process,” said  Jeffrey Coons ,
president of Manning & Napier Advisors Inc. in Fairport, New
York, which manages $35 billion. “The aggressive moves of the
Fed right after Lehman and ongoing today have been an important
driver for the stabilization of stock prices.”  The S&P 500, up 13 percent in 2010, has advanced 6.3
percent in December after losing 0.2 percent in November and
posting a combined gain of 13 percent in September and October,
the biggest increases during those months since 1998. The
measure has rallied 20 percent since Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke   suggested  on Aug. 27 that he was prepared to purchase
bonds to spur economic growth.  Tax Cuts, GE  The MSCI World Index, a gauge of 1,660 shares in 24
developed nations from the U.S. to Hong Kong, is within 1
percent of wiping out its 46 percent drop since Lehman’s
collapse. The index has gained 85 percent since March 2009 as
central banks worldwide maintained record-low interest rates and
governments spent trillions of dollars to spur growth.  Should the MSCI World erase its loss, “it would be a
positive and bullish development,” said  Christian Bendixen ,
director of technical research at New York-based Bay Crest
Partners LLC. “It has psychological and anecdotal
significance.”  The S&P 500 has risen 13 of the past 16 weeks. The last
time that happened was in 2004, according to  Howard Silverblatt ,
S&P’s New York-based senior index analyst. The December advance
was buoyed by an agreement between President  Barack Obama  and
Republican lawmakers to extend tax breaks, and by reports
showing consumer confidence, retail sales and manufacturing beat
economists’ forecasts.  Priceline, Ford  Consumer stocks in the S&P 500 such as online travel agency
 Priceline.com Inc.  and Dearborn, Michigan-based  Ford Motor Co. ,
had recovered all their losses from New York-based Lehman
Brothers by March 4. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index
has surged 21 percent since then.  Priceline, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, has surged almost
five-fold since September 2008 to $407, bolstered by a rebound
in hotel stays and international travel. Ford, the world’s most
 profitable  automaker and the only major U.S. car company to
avoid bankruptcy last year, more than tripled to $16.99 as
demand for pickups and sport-utility vehicles revived.  Analysts forecast that S&P 500 earnings will total $85.33 a
share in 2010, up 38 percent from $61.77 a share in 2009,
according to the average projection in a Bloomberg survey.
That’s the biggest increase since 1988, Bloomberg data show.  “The market is responding to earnings,” said  Hayes Miller ,
the Boston-based head of asset allocation in North America at
Baring Asset Management Inc., which oversees about $50.6 billion.
“It’s a commentary on corporate flexibility, the ability of
companies to cut costs and increase productivity. This looks
like it can last through 2011.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
