U.K. stocks  were little changed
before reports that may show U.S. consumers and businesses
accelerated their spending in November, adding to evidence that
the recovery in the world’s largest economy is intact.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  climbed 4.71, or 0.1 percent,
to 5,988.2 as of 9:11 a.m. in London. The gauge has rallied 11
percent in 2010 as companies reported higher earnings, the
European Union bailed out Greece and Ireland and the U.S.
Federal Reserve unveiled $600 billion of additional bond
purchases to support the recovery. The  FTSE All-Share Index  also
rose 0.1 percent today and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  added 0.1
percent.  Old Mutual Plc gained 1.6 percent to 124.8 pence. Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc increased 1.1 percent to 41.2 pence.
ARM Holdings slid 1.6 percent to 433.4 pence, paring yesterday’s
9 percent climb.  U.S. household purchases rose 0.5 percent last month after
a 0.4 percent increase in October, according to the median
estimate of 75 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Demand for
durable goods  excluding cars and aircraft may have climbed 1.8
percent. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the
both sets of data at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  The Labor Department is scheduled to report today that
weekly claims for jobless benefits for the week ended Dec. 18
held at 420,000, according to the survey median.  Other reports will show  sales of new houses  last month rose
6 percent from October to a 300,000 annual pace, and the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan  index of consumer sentiment 
climbed in December to a six-month high of 74.5.  The volume of shares traded on the FTSE 100 has slumped
this week to about half its daily average during 2010, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
