Steve Kean will remain as manager of
Blackburn Rovers until the end of the season, the English
Premier League soccer team said on its website.  Kean, 43, previously first-team coach, was put in charge on
Dec. 13 after the firing of Sam Allardyce. It followed the
purchase of the club last month by Indian poultry firm Venky’s.  “Venky’s London Ltd. -- Blackburn Rovers -- has decided to
continue with Mr. Steve Kean as manager until the end of the 
season, June 2011,” the club said.                   Blackburn is 12th in the league with 22 points from 18
games. It drew 1-1 with bottom club West Ham at the weekend  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
