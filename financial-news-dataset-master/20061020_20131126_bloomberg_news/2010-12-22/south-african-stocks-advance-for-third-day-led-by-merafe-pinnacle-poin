highest intraday level since June 2008.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, increased for the sixth day, jumping 4.05 rand, or 1.2
percent, to 346.53 rand. Copper traded within $50 of a record

second-largest producer, declined for the third day in four,
falling 1.25 rand, or 1 percent, to 118.50 rand.  The FTS/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index  retreated for the
second day as South Africa’s currency strengthened against the
dollar, lowering rand export revenues. Gold climbed 0.2 percent.  Merafe Resources Ltd.  (MRF SJ), a ferrochrome mining
company, advanced for the second day, gaining 2 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 1.59 rand. Merafe said it was in discussions with

million) from 306 million rand a year earlier. The company also
said unspecified price-sensitive talks were continuing.  Vodacom Group Ltd.  (VOD SJ), the biggest provider of
mobile-phone services to South Africans, retreated for the third
day, falling 17 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 75.13 rand. Vodacom
