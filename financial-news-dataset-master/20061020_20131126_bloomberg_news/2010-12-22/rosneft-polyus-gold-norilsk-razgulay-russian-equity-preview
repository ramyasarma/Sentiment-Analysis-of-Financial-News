Russia’s biggest oil producer rose 0.1 percent to 220.36 rubles.  OAO Polyus Gold  (PLZL RX): Gold prices rose for the third
straight session on speculation that Europe’s debt woes will

value. Russia’s largest gold producer declined 0.1 percent to
1,878.15 rubles.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel  (GMKN RX): Copper prices jumped to a
record after China said monthly imports of the metal increased

Russia’s largest miner, rose 0.3 percent to 6,698.33 rubles.  OAO Razgulay Group  (GRAZ RX): Agricultural commodities may
be in limited supply next year as land availability will tighten

changed at 47.01 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
