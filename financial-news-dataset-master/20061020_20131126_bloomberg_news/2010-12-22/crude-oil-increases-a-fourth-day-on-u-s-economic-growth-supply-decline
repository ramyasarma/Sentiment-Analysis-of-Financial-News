Crude oil rose to the highest level
in more than two years after government reports showed that U.S.
 supplies  dropped and the country’s economy grew more than
previously estimated in the third quarter.  Stockpiles fell 5.33 million barrels to 340.7 million last
week, the Energy Department said. A 3.4 million-barrel decline
was forecast, according to the median of 14 responses in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Commerce Department said gross
domestic product expanded 2.6 percent in the third quarter, up
from a previous estimate of 2.5 percent.  “Today’s crude numbers were very bullish,” said  Andre Julian , chief financial officer and senior market strategist at
OpVest Wealth Management in Irvine, California. “The GDP
numbers point to extended growth in the U.S. Previously, we were
seeing economic and demand growth in China and emerging markets,
now it’s spreading here.”  Crude oil for February delivery rose 66 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $90.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the highest settlement since Oct. 3, 2008. Prices have climbed
14 percent this year.  Brent crude oil for February settlement advanced 45 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $93.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest settlement price
since Oct. 1, 2008.  Supplies in the week ended Dec. 17 were 6.8 percent greater
than the five-year average for the period, the department said.  Gulf Coast  Stockpiles along the Gulf Coast, which holds almost half of
U.S. refinery capacity,  dropped  6.08 million barrels to 167.3
million. Some localities in the region levy taxes based on the
amount in storage at year’s end.  “The draw is not that meaningful,” said  Hamza Khan , an
analyst with Schork Group Inc., a consulting company in
Villanova, Pennsylvania. “The drop was largely limited to the
Gulf Coast while supplies gained at Cushing. This is why the
reaction was muted.”  Inventories  at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
New York futures, increased 479,000 barrels to 36.4 million, the
highest level since August.  Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, dropped 589,000 barrels to 160.7
million, the first decline in three weeks. Analysts were split
over whether supplies would rise or fall. Stockpiles on the East
Coast declined 1.17 million barrels to 66.3 million.  “The big drop along the East Coast was to be expected
because of the cold weather,” Khan said.  Low Temperatures  Cold air has gripped the New York region since Dec. 14,
when a high temperature in the mid-20s Fahrenheit (about minus 4
Celsius) was 20 degrees lower than normal. Weekend highs
are expected to be in the mid-30s.  Demand for distillate fuel climbed 7.4 percent to 4.05
million barrels a day, the highest level since Nov. 5.  Heating oil for January delivery climbed 1.21 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.5285 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since Oct. 3, 2008.  “We’re seeing another dramatic drop in U.S. oil storage,”
said  Sean Brodrick , a natural resource analyst with Weiss
Research in Jupiter, Florida. “We’re seeing an increase in
economic activity, which will lead to further declines and
higher prices.”  Today’s Commerce Department report showed consumer spending
rose at a 2.4 percent pace last quarter, the fastest since the
first three months of 2007, while less than the 2.8 percent
estimated last month. Spending added 1.67 percentage points to
GDP from July through September.  Household spending figures for November, due tomorrow, may
show a 0.5 percent gain following a 0.4 percent increase in
October, according to the Bloomberg survey median.  Grinding Higher  “We’re seeing oil grind higher along with the stock market
on increasing optimism about the economy,” said  Bill O’Grady ,
chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in
St. Louis.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  yesterday completed its
recovery from the six-month plunge that followed Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s collapse in September 2008, extending its rally
from a bear-market low in March 2009 to 85 percent.  The  S&P 500 Index  gained 0.3 percent to 1,257.77 at 3:22
p.m. in New York and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed
0.2 percent to 11,554.31.  China raised gasoline and diesel prices today by less than
half of what crude oil has gained in the past month. The price
of  gasoline  will climb by as much as 4 percent to 310 yuan ($47)
a metric ton and diesel by 300 yuan a ton, the National
Development and Reform Commission said yesterday, the third
increase this year in the second-largest oil consuming country.  ‘Over the Edge’  “The inventory numbers pushed us over the edge today,”
said  Phil Flynn , a Chicago-based analyst and trader at PFGBest,
an investment adviser. “If it were some other day, more
attention would have been paid to the Chinese news, which should
slow demand.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 344,353 contracts as of 3:23
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 357,619
contracts yesterday, 47 percent below the average of the past
three months and the lowest level since Nov. 26, the day after
Thanksgiving. Open interest was 1.37 million contracts.  “With this light holiday volume anything can happen,”
Flynn said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
