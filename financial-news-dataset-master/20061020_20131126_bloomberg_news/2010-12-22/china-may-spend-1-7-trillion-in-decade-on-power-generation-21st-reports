China, the world’s largest energy
user, may spend 11.1 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) in the next
10 years building electricity infrastructure, the 21st Century
Business Herald  reported  today, citing a research report by the
China Electricity Council.  China may boost investment in power grids and electricity
stations to 5.3 trillion yuan from 2011 to 2015, up 68 percent
from spending in 2006 to 2010, the newspaper said, citing Wei
Shaofeng, deputy director at the  council . Investment may rise to
5.8 trillion yuan from 2016 to 2020, the report said.  Power generation capacity may rise 8.5 percent annually to
1.437 million megawatts by 2015 and to 1.885 million megawatts
by 2020, according to the report. Power generation by non-fossil
fuels will account for 33 percent of the total by 2015 and 36.3
percent by 2020, it said.  The government may need to raise electricity prices by an
average 3.5 percent annually over the next 10 years to ensure
power producers get an 8 percent annual return on net assets,
the report said.  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
