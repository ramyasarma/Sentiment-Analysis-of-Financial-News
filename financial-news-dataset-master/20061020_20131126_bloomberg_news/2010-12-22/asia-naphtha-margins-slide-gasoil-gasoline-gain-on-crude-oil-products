Asian naphtha margins declined from
the highest this month after an industry report showed
stockpiles of the fuel in Japan rose. Gasoil advanced to the
highest since October 2008.  Light Distillates  The premium of naphtha for delivery to Japan above Brent
crude, or the crack spread, fell to $163.44 a metric ton at 5:52
p.m. Singapore time from $171.84 a ton at the end of Asian
trading yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Open-specification naphtha  for delivery to Japan dropped $2, or
0.2 percent, to $869.75 a ton.  Benchmark  92-RON gasoline  increased 0.9 percent to $101.90
a barrel, the highest since September 2008. Asia gasoline’s
premium to naphtha, or the  reforming margin , widened $1.15 to
$7.10 a barrel, Bloomberg calculations showed. A bigger gap
signals naphtha is less valuable to refiners relative to
gasoline.  Japan’s naphtha inventories rose 4.6 percent to 1.8 million
kiloliters in the week ended Dec. 18, the Petroleum Association
of Japan said today.  Glencore International AG sold 25,000 tons of naphtha for
second-half February delivery to Vitol Group at $872 a ton,
traders said. Glencore sold a second cargo to Royal Dutch Shell
Plc at the same price. The Swiss trader also sold 50,000 barrels
of 95-RON gasoline loading Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 to Total SA at
$103.90 a barrel.  ConocoPhillips sold 100,000 barrels of 92-RON loading Jan.
8 to Jan. 12 to Morgan Stanley at $101.95 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Singapore  gasoil , or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur
increased $1.50, or 1.5 percent, to $104.15 a barrel, Bloomberg
data showed. That’s the highest since Oct. 2, 2008.  Jet fuel 
climbed $1.55, or 1.5 percent, to $105.35.  In Singapore, the discount to benchmark quotes for 0.5
percent sulfur gasoil was erased after Trafigura Beheer BV
bought 150,000 barrels from BP Plc at parity, traders said.
Yesterday’s transaction was 30 cents below quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude widened 71 cents to $13.94
a barrel, the highest since Dec. 14, according to PVM Oil
Associates, a brokerage. The  crack spread , a measure of refining
profit, has fallen 10 percent since reaching $15.43 on Dec. 7,
the widest since January 2009.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 20 cents to $1.40 a
barrel, PVM said. A wider  regrade  indicates aviation-fuel
production is more profitable compared with diesel.  Fuel Oil  Prices of  180-centistoke fuel oil  in Singapore rose 0.2
percent to $517.25 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. Marine-fuel
grade  380-centistoke fuel oil  gained 0.3 percent to $507.25 a
ton.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, or the  crack spread ,
widened to $10.32 a barrel from $10.23, Bloomberg data showed.
The spread indicates that refiners are making the biggest losses
from the fuel since Dec. 15.  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings bought 20,000 tons of 380-
centistoke fuel oil loading Jan. 17 to Jan. 21 from Gunvor
International BV at a premium of 50 cents to prices published by
Platts. Shell bought 20,000 tons of the same grade for loading
Jan. 6 to Jan. 10 from Hin Leong Trading Pte at $507.75 a ton.  Brightoil also bought 20,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel
oil loading Jan. 8 to Jan. 12 from Chevron Corp. at parity to
Platts prices for the grade.  Refinery News  Idemitsu Kosan Co., Japan’s third-biggest oil refiner,
plans to process more crude in the January-to-March quarter as
it increases exports. The company will refine 8 million
kiloliters of crude, up 1 percent from a year earlier, Motohiro
Suzuki, manager of supply and logistics at Idemitsu, told
reporters in Tokyo today.  Hin Leong and partners may build a refinery in Singapore
that could cost between $6 billion to $8 billion, Business Times
reported, citing sources it didn’t identify.  -- Editor: Alexander Kwiatkowski  To contact the reporters on this story:
