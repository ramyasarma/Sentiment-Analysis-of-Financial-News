Wilmar International Ltd.  fell to a
six-month low as analysts at Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. queried the rationale for the world’s largest palm
oil trader’s entry into the real estate market.  Wilmar agreed with Kerry Properties (China) Ltd. and hotel-
operator Shangri-La China Ltd. to set up joint ventures to
develop properties in China’s Liaoning province, the Singapore-
based trader said late yesterday in a statement. Wilmar may
invest about $134 million in the business.  Wilmar fell 4.1 percent to S$5.68 at 12.11 p.m. local time,
the lowest since June 9. This extended the stock’s drop to a
third day, bringing this year’s decline to about 12 percent,
compared with an 8.7 percent gain in the benchmark index.  “We’re not entirely comfortable with the fact that they
are expanding beyond the consumer food related business,”
Citigroup analyst  Penny Yaw  said in a note to investors today.
“This property JV is just a first step, and we can expect more
joint bids in the future.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts  Patrick Tiah  and  Nikhil Bhandari  wrote in a note to clients today that the market may
react “negatively” to the venture. “This appears to be a
sharp departure from Wilmar’s agri-processing core business and
there may be concerns on management losing focus.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
