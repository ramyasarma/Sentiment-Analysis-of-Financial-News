Asian  stocks  rose, driving a
benchmark index close to a 2 1/2-year high, oil traded near $90
a barrel and the euro climbed after a gain in Japanese exports
boosted investor confidence in the global economic recovery.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent to 135.06 as
of 2:02 p.m. in Tokyo, approaching the highest level since July
2008. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed, a day after the index rebounded to its level before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The euro appreciated
against the dollar and yen. Oil advanced for a fourth day.  Japan’s export growth accelerated for the first time in
nine months as a rebound in global demand helped the nation’s
economy withstand an advance in the yen. Economists estimate
that reports later today will show U.S. existing-home sales
climbed and that gross domestic product increased.  “The world economy is recovering moderately,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. “Investors see money is flowing into stocks and
commodities, boosting confidence in the market.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index jumped 1 percent yesterday, the
most since Dec. 3 and putting the gauge on course for a 12
percent increase this year.  Canon Inc. , the world’s biggest camera maker, increased 1.9
percent in Tokyo after Japan’s Nikkei newspaper said the company
may report an 84 percent gain in annual operating profit. BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company and
Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, gained 0.9 percent in Sydney.  Post-Lehman Recovery  Japanese  exports  rose 9.1 percent in November from a year
earlier, the country’s finance ministry said in Tokyo today. The
median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for a 10.3 percent increase.  Yesterday in New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to
1,254.60, surpassing its closing level on Sept. 12, 2008, the
last trading day before Lehman filed for the world’s biggest
bankruptcy. The index has advanced 13 percent this year.  The euro strengthened for the first time in four days
against the dollar as its 14-day stochastic oscillator fell to
12 today, below the threshold of 20 that signals an asset is
poised to reverse direction.  The European currency rose to $1.3123 in Tokyo from $1.3100
in New York yesterday. The euro has fallen 2.8 percent versus
the dollar since touching a three-week high of $1.3499 on Dec.
14. It advanced to 110 yen from 109.71 yen.  Europe, U.S. Economy  Yesterday in Europe, Fitch Ratings said it may cut Greece’s
credit rating to non-investment grade within six weeks after a
review of the nation’s “fiscal sustainability.” Greece sought a
bailout this year, followed by Ireland.  Treasuries fell, extending their biggest monthly loss in a
year. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields rose one basis points to
3.32 percent according to BGCantor Market Data.  U.S. home purchases increased 7.1 percent in November from
October, the National Association of Realtors will say today,
according to the  median  of estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists.  The world’s largest economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, more than the 2.5 percent pace the
U.S. government estimated last month, a separate survey showed.
The data will be released today.  “We expect the economy to be strong over the next year,”
said  Tsutomu Komiya , who handles U.S. debt in Tokyo for Daiwa
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $103
billion and is part of Japan’s second-biggest brokerage.
“Shorter-end interest rates will rise faster than longer rates.  Crude oil increased as much as 0.3 percent to $90.09 a
barrel. The front-month contract gained $1.01 to $89.82 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the highest
settlement since Oct. 7, 2008. Prices have climbed 13 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
