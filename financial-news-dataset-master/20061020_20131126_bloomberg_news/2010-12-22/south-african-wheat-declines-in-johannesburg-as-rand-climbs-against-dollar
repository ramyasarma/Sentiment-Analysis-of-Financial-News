Wheat in  South Africa  fell as the
rand strengthened against the dollar, cutting the cost of
imports for local millers.  Wheat for March delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, declined 12 rand, or 0.4
percent, to 2,823 rand ($414) a metric ton.  The rand traded at 6.8049 to the dollar at 9:45 a.m. in
Johannesburg, compared with 6.8188 at the close of grain trading
at noon yesterday.  White corn for delivery in March rose 1 rand, or 0.1
percent, to 1,365 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is South
Africa’s staple food.  Yellow corn for March delivery gained 1 rand, or 0.1
percent, to 1,432 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
