Former AC Milan coach Leonardo is
the favorite to succeed  Rafael Benitez  at city rival Inter
Milan, according to Italian daily  Gazzetta dello Sport .  Inter President  Massimo Moratti  wants to replace Benitez
without having to pay his salary until his contract with the
European champion expires in 2012, the newspaper said. The
Spaniard joined Inter six months ago after leaving English
Premier League team Liverpool.  There’s media speculation in Italy and the U.K. that
Benitez is being dismissed by Inter after he criticized the club
for failing to back him in the transfer market.  Last night, Moratti told reporters that Benitez was still
in his post and said the club had not made contact with any
other coach.  The team is seventh in Serie A, 13 points behind leader AC
Milan. Inter won the FIFA Club World Cup at the weekend, beating
TP Mazembe Englebert 3-0 in the final in Abu Dhabi.  Brazil’s Leonardo, named AC Milan coach in May 2009 after
Carlo Ancelotti stepped down, left the post in May this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
