Corn futures rose to a six-week high
and soybeans gained for a fourth straight session on speculation
that the U.S. will increase exports to China, the world’s
biggest food consumer.  China will expand imports of grain and cotton and boost
government reserves of food staples including meat and sugar,
Minister of Commerce  Chen Deming  said today. U.S. exporters sold
116,000 metric tons of corn to unknown buyers and 110,000 tons
of soybeans to China, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today. China has been selling government reserves to boost
supplies and hold down prices.  “China is talking about increasing imports to boost
government reserves,” said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice
president at the Linn Group in Chicago. “Chinese demand is
going to rise.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $6.06 a bushel at 10:40 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, heading for the first five-session gain since Oct. 29.
Earlier, the price touched $6.0775, the highest since Nov. 9.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.43 a bushel in Chicago, after touching $13.4375,
the highest since Nov. 12.  Curbing inflation and ensuring supplies of commodities will
require “arduous work,” Commerce Minister Chen said today,
according to China National Radio.  China faces difficulty in boosting grain and cotton
supplies in the short term and the higher cost of commodities
will limit imports and the country’s ability to curb domestic
price increases, according to the report.  Rising meat consumption will support prices for feed grains
and soybeans as China’s economy expands in 2011 and 2012,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said earlier this month in a report.
Steps to increase domestic-crop production may not change
“China’s large import needs” because urbanization limits farm
expansion, the bank said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest grower and exporter of both
crops. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
