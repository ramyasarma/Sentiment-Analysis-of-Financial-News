South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest
crude importer, expects to more than triple production from oil
and gas fields owned by its energy companies by 2019.  Production may rise to 1.03 million barrels a day of oil
equivalent by 2019 from 260,200 barrels a day last year, the
 Ministry of Knowledge Economy  said today in its 10-year energy
and mineral policy plan.  South Korea and state-owned developers have said they will
increase energy output through the acquisition of overseas
assets.  Korea National Oil Corp. , which is completing the
acquisition of Scotland’s  Dana Petroleum Plc , wants to purchase
oil fields. Korea Gas Corp., the world’s biggest buyer of
liquefied natural gas, last week agreed to acquire a 15 percent
stake in the  Santos Ltd. -led Gladstone LNG venture in Australia.  The nation will also boost supplies of rare earths and
lithium from South Korean-owned mines overseas to account for 26
percent of annual requirements by 2019 from 7.3 percent last
year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
