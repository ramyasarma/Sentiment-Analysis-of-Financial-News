The International Tennis Federation
cut in half a two-year ban handed out to U.S. tennis player  Wayne
Odesnik  for importing human growth hormone into Australia, it
said today.  Odesnik, who in May was banned by the ITF for two years for
possessing a prohibited substance “without a therapeutic use
exemption,” will be eligible to play again from Dec. 29, the
London-based organization said in an e-mailed statement today.  The ITF reduced the suspension “on account of ongoing
substantial assistance provided by Mr. Odesnik in relation to
the enforcement of professional rules of conduct.”  Australian custom officials on Jan. 2 found eight vials,
each containing six milligrams of human growth hormone (HGH), in
Odesnik’s luggage when he entered the country to play a
tournament in Brisbane and the Australian Open, according to a
statement by the  Australian Customs and Border Protection  at the
time.  Odesnik pleaded guilty to the charge and was fined A$8,000
($8,000) and ordered to pay A$1,142.80 in costs in March.  The American, who had been ranked 98th on the ATP World
Tour rankings when he was banned, denied using HGH and never
tested positive for the banned substance.  HGH is considered a performance-enhancing drug because of
its ability to grow muscle and aid recovery after training,
while not being detectable in urine, unlike anabolic steroids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
