Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
said it revised its outlook on Slovenia to negative from stable
on signs the government may become less determined to narrow its
budget deficit.  The company kept Slovenia’s long-term sovereign credit
rating at AA and the short-term one at A-1+, while warning that
the change in outlook “reflects the possibility of a downgrade
over the next two years should Slovenia’s general government
debt burden fail to stabilize because of a weakened government
commitment to medium-term budgetary targets,” S&P analyst Marko
Mrsnik said in an e-mailed statement.  Slovenia’s export-driven economy slowed the most in 2009
among the 16 nations sharing the euro as demand in Europe waned.
 Gross domestic product  rose 1.7 percent in the third quarter
from the same three months a year ago, compared with a 2.2
percent year-over-year gain in the second quarter.  While the economy is recovering, the pace may not boost
government revenue enough to meet the government’s deficit
reduction targets, even as it seeks to restrain spending, the
company said.  S&P said it expects the budget shortfall to reach 5.2
percent of GDP in 2011, more than the government’s estimate of
4.8 percent, “which would delay the reversal of the currently
rising general government debt trajectory.”  “On the positive side, the Slovenian government is
currently undertaking a pension reform program, which, if
implemented, could, in our opinion, significantly contribute to
mitigating the budgetary challenges related to Slovenia’s aging
population,” it said. S&P viewed this overhaul “as being of
particular importance for the long-term sustainability of
Slovenia’s public finances.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
