Henderson Land Development Co.
reduced the height of a residential development in Hong Kong’s
western Mid-Levels area after its original plan met local
residents’ objection, the Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily
reported today.   The developer cut the height of the proposed building,
located at 23 to 27F Robinson Road, to 238.7 meters (783 feet),
from 247 meters, the paper said, without specifying its source
of information. The revision would remove two to three floors
from the original plan of a 35-storey building with 106 units
averaging 2,000 square foot each, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
