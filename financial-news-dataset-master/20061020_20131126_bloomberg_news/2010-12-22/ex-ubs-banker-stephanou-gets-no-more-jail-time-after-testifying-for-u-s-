Overnight LLC, an independent film
producer in New York, sued its former president, Aaron Kaufman,
claiming his “gross lapses in judgment” cost the company and
its founder a producer’s credit for the film “Black Swan.”  Overnight, in a breach-of-contract complaint filed today in
federal court in Manhattan, said Kaufman “misrepresented his
knowledge, skill and experience” in securing film financing
when he was hired by Overnight in early 2009. The company seeks
more than $10 million in damages.  Rick Schwartz, Overnight’s founder, had to forfeit a
producer’s credit for “Black Swan” and had difficulty securing
film financing because Kaufman entered into flawed deals and
gave priority to his personal business ventures, according to
the complaint.  “Black Swan” has been nominated for four Golden Globe
awards, including best drama. The thriller stars  Natalie Portman 
as a New York City ballet dancer poised to become a superstar
after being cast in a new version of “Swan Lake.”  Kaufman said today in a phone interview that the lawsuit
was “completely baseless” and “makes a number of libelous
claims.”  The case is Overnight LLC v. Kaufman, 10-cv-09564, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
