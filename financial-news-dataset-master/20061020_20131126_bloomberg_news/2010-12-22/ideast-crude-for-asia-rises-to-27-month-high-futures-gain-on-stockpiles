Middle East crude for sale to Asia
climbed to the highest in almost 27 months as futures in New
York rallied on bets demand growth will accelerate.  Oman  crude for immediate loading increased 17 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $90.79 a barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the highest since Sept. 30, 2008.  Dubai  oil
for loading in February climbed 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$90.51. Abu Dhabi’s light  Murban  crude gained 9 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $93.17.  Crude futures climbed for a fourth day in New York, topping
$90 a barrel on bets the U.S. economic recovery will boost
consumption. Oil stockpiles in the world’s largest crude user
dropped 5.8 million barrels last week to 342 million, the
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said yesterday. An
Energy Department report today may show a decline of 3.4 million,
according to a Bloomberg News  survey  of analysts.  The  premium  of London-traded Brent futures to Dubai swaps
rose 17 cents to $3.13 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based
on data from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This spread was at
the widest since Dec. 7, indicating it may be less profitable to
ship low-sulfur crude from the Atlantic basin to Asia compared
with high-sulfur Middle Eastern grades. The Atlantic basin
includes West Africa, the Mediterranean and the North Sea.  Futures contracts for Oman crude, the most widely traded
spot grade in Asia, settled at $90.49 a barrel for  February , the
Dubai Mercantile Exchange said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
