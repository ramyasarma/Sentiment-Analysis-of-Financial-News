Shanghai has overtaken Hong Kong as
the favorite city for companies to set up headquarters in
Greater China, the Standard reported, citing a survey by Regus
Plc, the world’s largest operator of serviced offices.  Some 50 percent of the 300 companies polled chose Shanghai
compared with 21 percent for Hong Kong, according to the survey,
the newspaper reported. Rising office rents and higher costs
contributed to Hong Kong slipping behind Shanghai, the newspaper
said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
