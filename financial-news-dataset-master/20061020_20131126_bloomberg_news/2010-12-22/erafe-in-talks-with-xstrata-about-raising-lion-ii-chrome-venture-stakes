Merafe Resources Ltd. , part owner of
the world’s biggest ferrochrome producer, said it’s in talks
with  Xstrata Plc  about increasing its stake in a planned 4.9
billion rand ($720 million) smelter in South Africa.  Merafe may raise its share of the 360,000 metric ton
project to 26 percent from 20.5 percent, Chief Financial Officer
 Zanele Matlala  said by phone from Johannesburg today. “We’re
still negotiating the price,” she said.  South Africa, the world’s largest ferrochrome producer, is
pushing mining companies to add value to the commodities they
mine before exporting them, to boost the nations’ earnings from
its mineral wealth. The country produced 2.2 million tons of
ferrochrome last year, or 37 percent of global output, according
to Merafe’s  website .  Merafe on Oct. 20 said its 20.5 percent participation in
the project would cost 1 billion rand. The smelter will boost
the annual production capacity of the Xstrata-Merafe venture to
more than 2.3 million tons, according to the companies.  Shares in Merafe  gained  2 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 1.59
rand by 10:15 a.m. in Johannesburg trading, extending the
advance so far this year to 14 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
