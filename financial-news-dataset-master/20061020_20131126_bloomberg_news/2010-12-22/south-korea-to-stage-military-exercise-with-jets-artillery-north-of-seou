South Korea said its military will
hold a one-day exercise tomorrow involving jet fighters and
mobile artillery in an area between Seoul and the Demilitarized
Zone that separates the nation from its communist neighbor.  About 800 military personnel will take part in the drill
near Pocheon, approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the
border with North Korea, said a spokesman at the Joint Chiefs of
Staff who declined to be named, citing military policy.  Defense Minister  Kim Kwan Jin  has said the military will
remain on alert even after an artillery drill on Yeonpyeong
Island along the disputed western maritime border ended on Dec.
20 without retaliation from North Korea. The official Korean
Central News Agency said that North Korea doesn’t need to
respond to every provocation and called the exercise on
Yeonpyeong “a childish play with fire of cowards.”  Separately, South Korean marines began routine maneuvers
today in waters near the eastern sea border with North Korea,
said defense ministry official who declined to be named, citing
government policy.  The drill near the eastern port of Geojin will last three
days, said the official, who didn’t give details on the size of
the exercise.  Geojin is on the opposite side of the Korean peninsula to
Yeonpyeong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
