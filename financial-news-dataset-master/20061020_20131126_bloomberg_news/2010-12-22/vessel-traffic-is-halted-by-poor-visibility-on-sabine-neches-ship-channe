Sabine-Neches Ship Channel pilots
halted boarding inbound and outbound vessels late yesterday
after fog reduced visibility, according to the Coast Guard
Vessel Traffic Service. Six ships are waiting to enter the port
and three are waiting to exit, said Eddie Diaz, a watch
supervisor with vessel traffic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
