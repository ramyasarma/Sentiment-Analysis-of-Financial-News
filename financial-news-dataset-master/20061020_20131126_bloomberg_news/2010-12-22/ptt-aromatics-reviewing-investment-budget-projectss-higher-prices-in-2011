PTT Aromatics & Refining Pcl,
Thailand’s second-biggest refinery by market value, is reviewing
an investment budget for 2010-2014 that may exceed an original
plan of $358 million, Chief Executive Officer Bowon Vongsinudom
said.  The plan is expected to be complete by June, Bowon said. A
$150 million jet diesel project and $1 billion olefin cracker
project won’t be included in the plan because they aren’t viable
at the moment, he said.  The company may increase the efficiency of its aromatics
plants to boost paraxylene production by 75,000 metric tons a
year, said Bowon.  Petrochemical prices and the difference between the price
of feedstock and fuel products are expected to rise next year
because of increased demand, Bowon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
