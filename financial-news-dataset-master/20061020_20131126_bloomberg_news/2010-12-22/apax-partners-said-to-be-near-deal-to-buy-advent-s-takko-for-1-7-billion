Apax Partners LLP, the London-based
private-equity firm, is close to reaching a deal to buy German
discount clothing retailer  Takko Holding GmbH  from Advent
International Corp. for about 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion),
said three people with knowledge of the talks.  The agreement may be announced as soon as today, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the negotiations
are private. Advent’s talks with competing bidder EQT Partners
AB ended and an initial public offering of Takko is unlikely,
they said.  Advent, manager of a 6.6 billion-euro leveraged buyout
fund, is selling Takko after buying the clothier for 770 million
euros in 2007. Takko operates more than 1,400 stores and plans
to open about 150 more a year as it expands in eastern Europe.
It has annual sales of more than 900 million euros and 10,800
employees, according to the Telgte-based company.  Spokesmen for Apax, Advent, based in Boston, EQT and Takko
declined to comment.  Leveraged buyout firms such as Apax pool money from
investors to take over companies, financing their purchases
mostly with debt, with the intention of selling them later for a
profit. Buyout firms seek to expand or improve performance at
companies they acquire before selling them within about five
years.  Apax’s investments include stakes in TDC A/S, Denmark’s
biggest telephone company, and Hit Entertainment Ltd., a
children’s entertainment company that owns Thomas the Tank
Engine and Bob the Builder.  To contact the reporters on this story:
