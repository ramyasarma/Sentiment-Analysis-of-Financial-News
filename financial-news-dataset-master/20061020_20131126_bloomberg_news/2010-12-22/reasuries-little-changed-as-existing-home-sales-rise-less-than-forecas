Treasuries were little changed after
a government report showed that sales of existing U.S. homes
rose less than forecast in November.  Government debt had pared losses earlier after a separate
report showed that third-quarter U.S. growth was less than
economists forecast and a measure of inflation increased at the
slowest pace in more than 50 years. The Federal Reserve is
scheduled to buy $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of Treasuries due
from February 2021 to November 2027 today as part of its
strategy of extending record monetary stimulus through debt
purchases.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
