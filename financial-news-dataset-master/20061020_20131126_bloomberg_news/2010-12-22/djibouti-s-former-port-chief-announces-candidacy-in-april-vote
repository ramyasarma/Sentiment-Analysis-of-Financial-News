Abdourahman Boreh, the former
chairman of Djibouti’s ports, announced he will challenge
President  Ismael Omar Guelleh  in April elections in the Horn of
Africa nation that hosts the only U.S. army base in Africa.  Boreh pledged to improve the standard of living for people
in the nation of 879,000 and prevent “serious civil unrest.”  “The country has had good income from its ports and
transport facilities, and from foreign bases on its territory,”
Boreh said in an e-mailed statement today. “But the population
remains chronically poor, with social indicators in line with
the very poorest countries of the world.”  Boreh said he was Chairman of the Djibouti Port and Free
Zone Authority from 2000 to 2009, before going into exile.  Goulleh, who is Djibouti’s second ruler since independence
from France in 1977, brought insurgents into a unity government
a decade ago to end years of fighting.  Djibouti’s port in the Gulf of Aden serves as a transit
point for goods leaving and entering landlocked Ethiopia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
