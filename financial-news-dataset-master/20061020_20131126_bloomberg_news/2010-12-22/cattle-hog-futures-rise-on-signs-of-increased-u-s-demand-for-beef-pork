Cattle futures rose to the highest
price since August 2008 on signs of rising demand for U.S. meat,
including from China, amid limited supplies. Hogs reached a
four-month high.  China will boost reserves of food staples including meat,
Minister of Commerce Chen Deming said in a statement on the
agency’s website. The rebuilding of China’s commodity
inventories provides “a tremendous amount of underlying
support” for prices, said  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at
Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois.  “Cattle are just on a run here,” Kane said. “We’re
moving beef internationally. We’ve got good demand with a
limited amount of beef.”  Cattle futures for February delivery advanced 1.75 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to settle at $1.0755 a pound at 1:08 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price rose by the 3-
cent exchange limit to $1.088, the highest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 7, 2008. The commodity has advanced 25
percent this year.  The price of wholesale  choice beef  is up 15 percent in
2010, and exports of the meat gained 17 percent in the 10 months
ended Oct. 31 from a year earlier, according to the most-recent
 data  from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. beef-cow
herd on July 1 was the smallest since at least 1973, the
government said in a semiannual report on July 23.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.65 cent,
or 0.5 percent, to $1.23625 a pound on the CME, after rallying 1
percent to $1.2415, the highest for a most-active contract since
the commodity started trading on Nov. 30, 1971.  Hogs Rally  Hog futures for February settlement rose 2.9 cents, or 3.8
percent, to 78.875 cents a pound on the CME. Earlier, the price
reached 78.95 cents, the highest for a most-active contract
since Aug. 19. Hog futures have rallied 20 percent this year.  Pork stockpiles in the U.S. fell 2.8 percent at the end of
November from a year earlier on signs of climbing demand, the
government said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
