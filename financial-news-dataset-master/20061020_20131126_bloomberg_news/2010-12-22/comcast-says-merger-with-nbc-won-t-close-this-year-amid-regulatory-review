Comcast Corp.’s purchase of  General
Electric Co. ’s NBC Universal unit won’t be completed this year,
a Comcast official said.  The deal is “on track” to close in January,  Sena Fitzmaurice , a vice president, said in an e-mailed message.  The deal proposed last year needs approval from the Federal
Communications Commission and the Justice Department.  Comcast , the largest U.S. cable company, would gain control
of the NBC television network, broadcast stations and cable
channels such as MSNBC and USA Network.  “It now appears that we will not be able to close the
transaction with GE relating to NBC Universal by year-end,”
Fitzmaurice said. “We have notified our transition teams that
there will not be a December 31 closing. We believe the
regulatory review puts us on track for a closing in January.”  GE in a statement said it also expects the transaction to
close in January.  The FCC may require Comcast to share programming with
online video companies, and submit to limits on withholding
cable channels from pay-TV competitors such as  DirecTV  and  AT&T
Inc .,  Paul Gallant , a Washington-based analyst with MF Global,
said in a Dec. 20 note to investors.  Comcast is acquiring a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal
from GE by paying $6.5 billion in cash and contributing cable
channels worth $7.25 billion to a joint venture that will own
the entertainment company.  Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has
filed documents opposing the Comcast-NBC Universal combination
as it was proposed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
