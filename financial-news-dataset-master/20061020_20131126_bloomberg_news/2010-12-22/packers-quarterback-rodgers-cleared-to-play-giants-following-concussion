Green Bay Packers quarterback  Aaron Rodgers  was cleared to play against the New York Giants on Dec.
26 after missing a game with a concussion.  Rodgers, 27, passed neurological tests and was cleared by
doctors to resume practicing with the team, Packers coach  Mike McCarthy  said today in a press conference. Rodgers suffered the
concussion, his second of the season, in the first half of a 7-3
loss to the Detroit Lions on Dec. 11. He played one more down,
then sat out last weekend’s loss to the New England Patriots.  Rodgers wore a different helmet in practice today and is
expected to play against the Giants, McCarthy said. Third-year
quarterback  Matt Flynn  started last weekend in Rodgers’ place.  A 2009 Pro Bowl selection, Rodgers has started all but one
of the team’s 47 games since  Brett Favre  left in 2008. This
season he has completed 65 percent of his passes for 3,289 yards
and 23 touchdowns. Rodgers’ record as a starter is 25-21.  The Packers (8-6) host the Giants (9-5) at Lambeau Field in
a game with playoff implications for both teams. While the
Packers can’t win the National Football Conference North, a win
will keep them in contention for a wild-card berth, given to the
two best teams that do not win a division in each conference.
The Giants can clinch a playoff berth with a victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
