Deutsche Post AG , the world’s
biggest transporter of air and sea freight, said its DHL unit
got a 2 billion-euro ($2.6 billion) credit line in the company’s
first syndicated loan.  The five-year revolving credit facility will replace
existing credit lines agreed individually with banks, the Bonn-
based company said in a  statement  today. Money in a revolving
credit can be borrowed again once it’s repaid.  “By concluding this syndicated credit line we have, as
planned, further reduced the complexity of our financing
instruments and secured long-term advantageous financing
conditions,” Deutsche Post DHL Chief Financial Officer  Larry Rosen  said in the statement.  Citigroup Inc., Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC
Holdings Plc, coordinators of the transaction, invited a wider
group of lenders to join the transaction in November, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Post offered to pay initial interest of 55 basis
points more than the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
for the financing, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
