Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at the roadside monitoring stations of Central and
Mong Kok, triggering public health warnings, the Environmental
Protection Department said.  The index was 112 at Central, and 105 at Mong Kok as of 6
a.m., the department said.  Roadside pollution readings above 100 trigger a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory ailments to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
