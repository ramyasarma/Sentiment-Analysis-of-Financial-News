Former Argentine dictator  Jorge Rafael Videla , who ran the South American country from 1976 to
1981, was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against
humanity.  Videla, 85, and other former officials, including former
army General Luciano Benjamin Menendez, faced charges for the
execution of 31 prisoners in 1976 in the central province of
Cordoba.  “I haven’t come to defend myself or argue in my defense,”
Videla told the court yesterday. “I’ll assume under protest the
unfair sentence that I may receive.”  Menendez, 83, was also given a life sentence by the three-
man court in the provincial capital city of Cordoba.  In 1985, two years after the country returned to democracy,
Videla and fellow junta members  Emilio Massera  and Orlando
Agosti, were sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes committed
during the dictatorship. They were later pardoned by former
President  Carlos Menem .  In 2007, under the government of then President  Nestor Kirchner , an Argentine federal court annulled the pardons.  According to human right associations, about 30,000 people
disappeared during the 1976-1983 military dictatorship.  Massera, Videla and Agosti led the March 1976 military coup
that unseated the government of  Maria Estela Martinez de Peron .
Massera died Nov. 8 after a stroke and Agosti died in 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
