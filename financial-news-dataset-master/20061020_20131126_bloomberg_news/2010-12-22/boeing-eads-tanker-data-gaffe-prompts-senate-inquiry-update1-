Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman Carl Levin promised an investigation into the release
of bid data for Boeing Co. and European Aeronautic Defence &
Space Co. on the U.S. Air Force’s new aerial tanker.  The Michigan Democrat’s pledge today for at least one
hearing by Feb. 1 centers on an Air Force error that the service
said gave Boeing and EADS a “limited amount” of information
about each other’s proposal for the $35 billion tanker program.  “I am prepared to direct staff immediately to initiate an
investigation into the release to determine if laws and fair
competition regulations have been appropriately followed,”
Levin told Senator Maria Cantwell on the Senate floor, according
to a transcript from Levin’s office.  Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, the home of
Boeing’s  commercial airplane business , was prepared to block the
$725 billion defense policy bill until winning Levin’s promise
to investigate, said a Senate aide familiar with the issue, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.  A Cantwell objection would have prevented a recorded vote
for 30 hours on the defense measure, which was approved today by
the Senate for fiscal 2011.  Winner Announcement?  The winner of the tanker competition may be announced next
month as the Air Force chooses between competing models from
Chicago-based Boeing and EADS to replace 179 of a fleet of more
than 500 KC-135 refueling aircraft. The military depends on the
tankers to extend the range of combat and transport planes.  An Air Force spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Miller, had
no immediate comment on Levin’s inquiry.  Boeing and EADS each mistakenly received a single page of
data on mission capabilities, not pricing, for its rival’s
aircraft, the Air Force said last month. Those bids are now
under government review.  Boeing  gained 42 cents to $64.61 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  EADS , which has headquarters
in Paris and Munich, fell 4 cents to 18.03 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
