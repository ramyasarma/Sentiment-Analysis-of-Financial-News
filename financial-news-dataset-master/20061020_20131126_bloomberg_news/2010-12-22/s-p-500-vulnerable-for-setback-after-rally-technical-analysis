The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  has
reached “overbought” levels after surging 6.3 percent this
month and may be heading for losses early next year, according
to technical analysts at UBS AG.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks rose 0.6 percent to
1,254.6 yesterday, completing its recovery from the plunge that
followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in 2008. The
increase pushed the S&P 500’s 14-day  relative strength index ,
which tracks momentum by comparing closing prices with daily
trading ranges, to 70.81. Technical analysts say an RSI above 70
indicates an index is likely to fall.  “The market is overbought and we have initial signals of
deteriorating momentum,” Zurich-based analysts  Michael Riesner 
and  Marc Mueller  wrote in a report dated yesterday. “The air on
the upside is getting increasingly thin and the market will be
vulnerable for a setback in early first quarter.”  The analysts said they were concerned that data from
Investors Intelligence shows bullishness is at the highest level
since equities peaked in October 2007. In addition, they said
U.S. stocks last week formed a technical indicator known as the
Hindenburg Omen, named for the German zeppelin that caught fire
and crashed more than seven decades ago, that has “a very good
track record in signalling/indicating the risk of a stronger
correction or major market top.”  Hindenburg Omen  The Hindenburg Omen occurs when an unusually high number of
companies in the New York Stock Exchange reach 52-week  highs and
lows . After the indicator was last formed in August, the S&P 500
surged 8.8 percent the following month, showing that at that
time “it was obviously not a valid signal,” Riesner and
Mueller wrote.  “As long as the market trades above 1,220 the short-term
price structure remains bullish and we expect the  S&P 500  to
test its next minor resistance at 1,260,” the analysts wrote.
They added that the gauge has a “key support” at 1,173 and a
“strategic target” of 1,350.  Futures on the S&P 500 expiring in March rose less than 0.1
percent to 1,250.8 at 6:30 a.m. in New York today.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. UBS is ranked as the top bank for
equity technical analysis and charting according to a 2010
Thomson Extel survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
