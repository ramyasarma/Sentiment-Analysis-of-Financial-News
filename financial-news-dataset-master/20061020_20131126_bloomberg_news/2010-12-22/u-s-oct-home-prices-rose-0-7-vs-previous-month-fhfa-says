U.S. home prices fell 3.4 percent in
October from a year earlier as sales of foreclosed properties
dragged down values, the  Federal Housing Finance Agency  said.  The decline was led by an 8.1 percent slump in the region
that includes Nevada and Arizona, the agency said today in a
report from Washington. Prices decreased 5.7 percent in the area
that includes Mississippi and dropped 5.6 percent in California
and other West Coast states.  Foreclosures reduce real estate values because they sell at
cut-rate prices. U.S. homes in the  default  process sold for
about 32 percent less than non-distressed properties in the
third quarter, the biggest discount in five years, according to
RealtyTrac Inc., an Irvine, California-based data seller.  Home prices rose 0.7 percent from September, the FHFA said.
Economists projected a 0.2 percent decline from the prior month,
according to the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Today’s FHFA report is based on repeat sales data that
compares prices of the same properties over time. The regulatory
agency, which measures  sales  of homes with mortgages backed by
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, doesn’t provide a specific price.  As measured by the National Association of Realtors in
Chicago, the median home  price  was $170,500 in October, the
period covered by the government report.  The median price in November increased to $170,600, the
Realtors group said in a separate report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
