Senegal should borrow as much as
$500 million over the next three years by selling government
bonds to help raise funds to improve roads outside the capital,
Dakar, the International Monetary Fund said.  The West African nation should turn to international
investors to help finance infrastructure projects as donors
reduce funding to poor countries, Norbert Funke, the IMF’s
mission chief for Senegal, said in a phone interview from
Washington yesterday.  “Given the fact that many donor countries are facing
difficulties, it is not getting easier for developing countries
to get additional concessional resources,” Funke said. “For
countries that did make quite a bit of progress over the past 10
years, and Senegal is one of those countries, it is getting
easier for countries to attract international investors to back
profitable projects.”  The IMF this month approved a three-year monitoring program
with Senegal, called a “ policy support instrument ,” aimed at
countries that seek the IMF’s advice and endorsement of their
policies and not loans from the fund.  Senegal has a sovereign credit rating of B+ from Standard &
Poor’s, four levels below investment grade. The IMF expects the
economy to expand 4.4 percent next year, up from an estimated 4
percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
