Ethiopia will introduce as many as
eight new television channels in 2011 featuring programs made by
non-government broadcasters for the first time, Communications
Minister Bereket Simon said.  State-owned Ethiopian Television’s two channels currently
offer no private content, so the move is a “significant
change,” Bereket said in a phone interview today from the
capital, Addis Ababa.  “So far we have only limited private FM radio stations,”
he said. “Now we are going to have private content providers
for television.” The “infrastructure” will still be operated
by the Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency, Bereket said.  State media coverage of Ethiopia’s parliamentary elections
in May, which the ruling party won by a landslide, was not
“balanced,” the European Union’s observation mission said in
its report on the vote. The government has admitted to jamming
the Voice of America’s Amharic-language service and has been
accused of blocking opposition-friendly websites and a new
Amsterdam-based satellite channel, Ethiopian Satellite
Television.  The country’s sole Internet provider is the state-run Ethio
Telecom, which will be managed by France Telecom SA for the next
two years under a 30 million-euro ($39 million) contract
announced on Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
