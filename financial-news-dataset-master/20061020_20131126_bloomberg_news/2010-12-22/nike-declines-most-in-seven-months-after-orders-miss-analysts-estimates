Nike Inc. , the world’s largest maker
of athletic shoes, dropped the most in 21 months after reporting
orders that fell short of some analysts’ estimates.  Nike  fell  $5.35, or 5.8 percent, to $86.95 at 4:04 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest drop
since March 5, 2009. The shares closed yesterday before the
report at $92.30, the highest price since its initial public
offering in 1980.  Orders for the Nike brand for December to April rose 11
percent to $7.7 billion, excluding currency fluctuations, from a
year ago, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said in a
statement yesterday. That missed the 11.6 percent gain projected
by an average of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Orders
gained 13 percent from September through January.  “A lot of people who love this stock hoped for something
better,” said  Chris Svezia , an analyst for Susquehanna
Financial Group in New York. “At a 52-week high, they expected
this company to knock the cover off the ball.”  Investors are concerned that orders in China and emerging
markets decelerated from the previous period,  Sam Poser , an
analyst for Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. in New York, said
yesterday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.  Orders for China gained 14 percent, compared with an
advance of 23 percent in the prior period, while emerging
markets increased 15 percent, down from a 24 percent.  The growth in orders was affected by comparisons to last
year when the World Cup drove purchases in those regions, Nike
Chief Financial Officer  Donald Blair  said yesterday in a
conference call with analysts.  Nike reported second-quarter  net income  increased 22
percent to $457 million, or 94 cents a share, in the period
ended Nov. 30, from $375.4 million, or 77 cents a year earlier.
Analysts projected 88 cents, the average of 16 estimates. That
marked the 18th straight quarter the shoemaker has surpassed
expectations, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
