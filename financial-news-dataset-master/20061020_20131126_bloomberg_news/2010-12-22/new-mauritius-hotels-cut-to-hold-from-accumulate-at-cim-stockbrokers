New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. , the
Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest leisure group by market
value, was cut to “hold” at Cim Stockbrokers Ltd.  “The snow cloud in Europe continues to impact on air
travel,” Port Louis-based analysts Kishen Nadassen and Madhvi
Bhylagee wrote in an e-mailed note to clients dated today.
“This together with the weak euro could still restrain growth
for 2011.”  The recommendation was reduced from “accumulate,”
Nadassen said in a separate telephone interview today.  European travel may ease today as airlines and rail
operators work to return service to more-normal levels as snow
and ice grounded jets and snarled train lines for four days.  Profit for the year through September 2010 declined 44
percent to 659.78 million rupees ($22 million), or 4.09 rupees
per share, compared with a year earlier, the company said in a
statement on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website
yesterday. The  stock gained  1 percent to 105 rupees by 12:37
p.m. in Port Louis, giving the company a multiple of 25.6 times
earnings.  “Despite trading at a high price-earnings ratio, we
believe that the stock offers good medium- to long-term
potential,” the analysts said. “The group started its 2011
financial year on a positive note and is expected to post better
results for the financial year, expecting growth of 10 percent
for the first quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
