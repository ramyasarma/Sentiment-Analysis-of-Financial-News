Italian household confidence  rose in
December to an 11-month high as the economy expanded and
unemployment fell in the third quarter, making consumers more
optimistic about the recovery.  The  Isae Institute’s  consumer sentiment index rose to 109.1
from 108.5 in November, the Rome-based research center said
today in a statement. The reading was the highest since January
and more than the 108.3  median forecast  of six economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Growing exports helped boost Italy’s  gross domestic product 
0.3 percent in the three months through September, more than the
0.2 percent initially reported.  Unemployment  fell in the third
quarter to 8.3 percent, less than the 10.1 percent average for
the euro region in October, a separate report showed yesterday.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
