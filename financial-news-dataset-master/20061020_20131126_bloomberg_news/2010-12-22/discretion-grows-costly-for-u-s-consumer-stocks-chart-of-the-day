This year’s best-performing industry
group in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index seems poised to fall,
according to  Myles Zyblock , chief institutional strategist at
RBC Capital Markets.  U.S. automakers, homebuilders, retailers and other
companies dependent on consumers’ discretionary income are the
index’s most expensive stocks, Zyblock wrote today in a report.
The shares trade at their highest price-to-sales ratio relative
to the S&P 500 since the 1980s, the report said.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the ratio for the S&P 500
Consumer Discretionary Index and the S&P 500 since 1993, when
Bloomberg’s price-to-sales figures begin. The  group  was valued
at 1.1 times sales yesterday, when the stock-market  gauge  stood
at 1.34 times.  “Valuations look stretched,” Zyblock wrote, especially
because the group’s profitability has been unusually high. Net
income this year exceeded 6 percent of sales, the widest profit
 margin  since at least the 1970s, according to the report.  Consumer-discretionary stocks rose 27 percent for the year
through yesterday, the  biggest gain  among the S&P 500’s 10 main
industry categories. The group had a four-percentage-point lead
on industrial stocks, the second-best performers, and a 14-point
advantage over the S&P 500.  Zyblock has an “underweight” rating on these stocks,
meaning that investors should have a smaller holding than
benchmark indexes would suggest. About 11 percent of the S&P
500’s value is derived from consumer-discretionary companies,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
