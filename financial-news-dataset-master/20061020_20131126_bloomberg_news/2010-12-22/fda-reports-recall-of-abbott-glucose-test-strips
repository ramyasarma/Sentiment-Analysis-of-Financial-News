Abbott Laboratories  is recalling as
many as 359 million glucose test strips because they may
incorrectly show low blood-sugar levels, U.S. regulators said.  The false readings result from a manufacturing defect that
prevents the test strips from absorbing enough blood, the Food
and Drug Administration said today in a statement.  Patients with diabetes who use the strips may fail to treat
elevated blood glucose because of a false reading, or may try to
raise their blood sugar unnecessarily, the agency said. Abbott,
based in Abbott Park, Illinois, markets the strips under the
names Precision Xceed Pro, Precision Xtra, MediSense Optium,
Optium, OptiumEZ and ReliOn Ultima, the agency said. The strips
are sold in retail stores and online, and are used in health-
care facilities.  “Patients with diabetes should be aware of the recalled
glucose test strips and take steps to prevent them from
affecting their health,” Alberto Gutierrez, director of the
FDA’s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics, said in the statement.
“FDA and Abbott are reviewing the cause of the manufacturing
defect to avoid this problem in the future.”  Abbott said in a statement today that it initiated the
recall after conducting a routine internal quality review.
Customers who have purchased test strips from the 359 affected
lots should stop using them, and Abbott will replace them at no
charge, the company said.  Abbott fell 16 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $47.84 at
4:03 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
 shares  have declined 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
