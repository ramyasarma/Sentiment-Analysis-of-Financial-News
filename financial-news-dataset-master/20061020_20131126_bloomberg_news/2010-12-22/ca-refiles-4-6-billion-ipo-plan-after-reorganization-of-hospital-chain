HCA Holdings Inc. , the U.S. hospital
chain owned by KKR & Co. and Bain Capital LLC, refiled plans for
an initial public offering after completing a corporate
reorganization.  The Nashville, Tennessee-based company still plans to sell
as much as $4.6 billion of shares, according to a regulatory
filing today. The company pulled its previous registration,
filed in May, because of the reorganization.  The registration reiterates that the private-equity owners,
who paid themselves a $2 billion dividend in November, are
contemplating a public share sale. Buyout managers typically
reap profits for their investors and themselves through IPOs,
sales to corporations or dividend recapitalizations.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Bracken said at the time of
the most recent dividend that the company’s IPO was still
pending.  KKR , based in New York, and Boston-based Bain, along with
Merrill Lynch & Co., bought HCA in 2006 for $33 billion, then
the largest leverage buyout on record. The deal was overtaken by
the buyouts of Equity Office Properties and TXU Corp. the
following year.  Merrill Lynch is now owned by Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
