Indianapolis Colts wide receiver
 Austin Collie  will miss the remainder of the National Football
League season as he recovers from his second concussion of the
year.  The Colts placed Collie, 25, on the injured-reserve list
today, the team said on  its website . Collie suffered a
concussion in the first half of the team’s 34-24 win over the
Jacksonville Jaguars on Dec. 19. He caught two touchdown passes
before the injury and didn’t return to the game.  Collie, a second-year player from Brigham Young University,
leads the Colts with eight touchdown catches and is second on
the team with 58 receptions after missing five games. He
sustained his first concussion of the year against the
Philadelphia Eagles on Nov. 7.  The Colts (8-6) travel to play the Oakland Raiders (7-7) on
Dec. 26. Indianapolis can clinch its ninth straight playoff
berth with a win against the Raiders and a home victory over the
Tennessee Titans on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
