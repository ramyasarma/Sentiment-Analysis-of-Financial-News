South African bond yields fell to a
1 1/2-week low after a report showing economic growth is likely
to remain subdued boosted speculation that the central bank may
reduce borrowing costs next year to help revive the economy.  The benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 was
little changed at 123.87 rand as of 5:20 p.m. in Johannesburg.
The yield dropped 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.41 percent, the lowest close since Dec. 10.  The  South African Reserve Bank ’s leading economic
indicator, which signals business trends 6 to 12 months ahead,
fell in October from the month before. The indicator dropped to
129.8 from a revised 130.6 in September, the Pretoria-based bank
said in a statement on its website today.  “The economy is humming along but it’s not really
recording any exciting growth rates,”  Elna Moolman , an
economist at Renaissance BJM in Johannesburg, said in a
telephone interview. “That’s not what this economy needs to
solve its problems. There’s still a risk that there will be
another rate cut.”  Monetary policy makers in Africa’s biggest economy have
lowered the benchmark interest rate to  5.5 percent , the lowest
level since the repurchase rate was first introduced in 1999, in
an attempt to spur economic growth. The economy expanded  2.6
percent  in the third quarter, lower than the 7 percent the
government says is needed to remedy South Africa’s 25.3 percent
jobless rate, the highest of 62 nations tracked by Bloomberg.  Rate-Cut ‘Risk’  “Today’s data on its own might not be enough to sway the
Reserve Bank but combined with more negative data going forward
it could begin to persuade them,” said Moolman. Interest rates
are likely to remain unchanged at 5.5 percent for all of next
year though “the risk remains” of a further 50 basis point
reduction, Moolman said.  Forward-rate agreements , or FRAs, showed money-market
investors added to bets the central bank may reduce its main
interest rate in the first quarter of next year. The cost of
three-month contracts for cash due in three months fell half a
basis point, or 0.005 percentage point, to 5.46 percent.  The rand gained 0.3 percent to 6.7961 per dollar, from a
previous close of 6.8146. Against the euro, the rand added 0.5
percent to 8.8940.  To contact the reporter on this story:
