ICAP Plc , the world’s biggest broker
of trades between banks, lost a bid to force two former
employees to pay a further HK$32.9 million ($4.2 million) in
compensation for resigning with immediate effect.  Former Hong Kong equity desk head  Elaine Chan  and deputy
 Paul Kwok  don’t have to pay ICAP funds equivalent to the bonuses
they would have earned had they stayed, Hong Kong Court of First
Instance Judge Arjan Sakhrani ruled today.  Chan and Kwok quit in November 2006 to join Nittan Capital
Asia Ltd. and paid ICAP a combined HK$5 million in lieu of
working their notice period to January 2008. Sakhrani said ICAP
couldn’t be paid what the workers may have earned in bonuses,
which can’t be considered wages.  “We are reserving our position with respect to an
appeal,” said London-based ICAP's spokesman  Mike Sheard  in an
e-mailed statement.  ICAP’s Hong Kong unit said the bonuses would have been the
same as they earned a year earlier: HK$19.5 million for Chan and
HK$13.4 million for Kwok.  ICAP this month also failed to prevent a competitor in
Singapore hiring 37 of its brokers until as late as March 2012.  Hong Kong’s  employment statutes  were amended in 2007, the
year after Chan and Kwok resigned, to provide a method of
calculating wages to be paid in lieu of notice.  “I am happy with the result and am glad this episode is
over after more than three years,” Chan said by e-mail today.
“It’s time to move on.”  The case is ICAP (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Elaine Chan and Kwok
Chi Leung HCA636&637/2007 in the Hong Kong Court of First
Instance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
