Walgreen Co. , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, reported a 19 percent increase in first-quarter
profit, surpassing analysts’ projections and pushing the shares
up the most in almost three months.  Walgreen said today that net income advanced to 62 cents a
share, beating the 54-cent average of  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Prescription sales, which generated about two-thirds
of total revenue, climbed 5.3 percent.  Walgreen remodeled stores to get rid of slower selling
items, helping to lower inventories, Chief Financial Officer
Wade Miquelon said on a conference call. The Deerfield,
Illinois-based company, which competes with drug chains such as
CVS Caremark Corp. and Rite Aid Corp., said it’s on track to
meet its goal of lowering costs by $1 billion this year.  The shares climbed $2.02, or 5.5 percent, to $38.85 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the most
since Sept. 28. They have advanced 5.8 percent this year.  Walgreen operates more than 7,600 stores across the U.S.
Net income for the quarter ended Nov. 30 advanced to $580
million, from $489 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement.  Walgreen sales advanced 6 percent to $17.3 billion,
matching the average analyst estimate. The drugstore chain has
sought to expand in cities such as New York, with the
acquisition of smaller rival Duane Reade Holdings Inc. this
year. In April, Walgreen completed the acquisition of the 50-
year-old chain, which then operated more than 250 stores in the
New York area.  Gross margin, the fraction of sales left after the cost of
goods sold, widened by 0.8 percentage point to 28.5 percent,
Walgreen said. The company also benefited from generic drug
sales and fewer inventory writedowns compared with a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
