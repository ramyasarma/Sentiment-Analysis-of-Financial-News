Motorola Mobility Inc. , the
smartphone maker being spun off from Motorola Inc., bought
software company Zecter Inc. to help consumers transfer music
more easily between its handsets and other devices.  Zecter’s ZumoCast and ZumoDrive software let users move
content from phones to computers and tablet devices, Motorola
Mobility said today in a statement. The price wasn’t disclosed.  Motorola Mobility, which begins trading as a separate
company next month, is trying to distinguish itself from  Samsung
Electronics Co.  and HTC Corp., which also build phones based on
Google Inc.’s Android software. Verizon Wireless, the largest
U.S. wireless carrier, said yesterday it will release a Motorola
phone for its new high-speed wireless network next year.  Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Illinois, gained 9 cents to
$9.09 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The  shares  have climbed 17 percent this year. Motorola Mobility,
which is trading on a preliminary basis under the symbol MMI-W,
rose $1.68, or 6.1 percent, to $29.42. The stock will begin
trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 4 with the ticker
MMI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
