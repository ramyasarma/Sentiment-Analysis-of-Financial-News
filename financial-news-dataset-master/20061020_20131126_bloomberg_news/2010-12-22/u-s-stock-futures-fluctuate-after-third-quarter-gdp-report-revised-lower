U.S. stock futures fluctuated
between gains and losses as government data showed the economy
grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, faster
than previously estimated while less than the median economist
forecast.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,250.5 at 8:34 a.m. in New
York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures decreased 1 point, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 11,470.  The revised increase in gross domestic product compares
with a 2.5 percent estimate issued last month and was less than
the median forecast of a 2.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey,
figures from the Commerce Department showed today. Inventories
rose more than initially reported, while the rise in household
purchases was revised down.  The S&P 500 yesterday completed its recovery from the six-
month plunge that followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
collapse in September 2008, extending its rally from a bear-
market low in March 2009 to 85 percent. The index will end 2011
at 1,374, according to the average forecast of 11 strategists at
Wall Street’s biggest banks, producing the biggest three-year
advance since 1997-2000.  Another report today may show sales of existing homes
increased to a 4.75 million annual rate, up 7.1 percent from
October, according to the median of 70 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. Lower prices and mortgage rates have made houses
more affordable, which may keep supporting demand after the end
of a government tax credit caused the industry to slump. The
National Association of Realtors is scheduled to release the
sales figures at 10 a.m. in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
