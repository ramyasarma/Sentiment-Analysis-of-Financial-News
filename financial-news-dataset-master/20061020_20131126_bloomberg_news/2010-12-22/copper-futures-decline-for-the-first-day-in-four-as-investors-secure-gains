Copper in London declined for the
first time in four days as some investors sold the metal to lock
in gains after it climbed to an all-time high yesterday. The
metal fell from a record in New York.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.3 percent to $9,340 a metric ton by
9:56 a.m. Singapore time, after rising as much as 0.3 percent
earlier.  Futures on the Comex in New York reached a record $4.2965 a
pound in early Asian trading, before trading 0.3 percent lower
at $4.2650 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
