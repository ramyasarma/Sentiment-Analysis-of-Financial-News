Copper advanced for a fourth day
from London to Shanghai as the demand outlook continued to
improve amid supply disruptions in Chile, the world’s largest
producer of the metal used in cars and household appliances.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.3 percent to $9,390 a metric ton, and
traded at $9,370 by 9:05 a.m. Singapore time. It reached a
record $9,392 a ton yesterday.  Futures on the Comex in New York were little changed at
$4.2780 a pound, after touching an all time high of $4.2965
earlier. Copper for March-delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 1.1 percent to 70,000 yuan a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
