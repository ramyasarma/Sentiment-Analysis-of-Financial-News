Gold rose for a fourth day in
London, buoyed by the International Monetary Fund announcing
that it completed a planned sale of some of its bullion
reserves. Silver, platinum and palladium also advanced.  The IMF sold about 403.3 metric tons, or 13 percent of its
reserves, in a program that began in September 2009, the
Washington-based group said yesterday. The total amount sold was
equal to about 15 percent of global mine supply, according to
data GFMS Ltd., a London-based research company.  “The last of the overhang has now gone,”  Peter Richardson , chief metals economist at Morgan Stanley in
Melbourne, said by phone today. “The market will take that as a
positive development.”  Gold for immediate delivery advanced $3.07, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,388.67 an ounce at 12:16 p.m. in London. Gold climbed 27
percent this year, reaching a record $1,431.25 on Dec. 7. Gold
for February delivery on the Comex exchange in New York was
little changed at $1,389.10 an ounce.  More than half the IMF gold was bought by the central banks
of India, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Bangladesh, according to past
announcements. With the IMF’s sales complete, few others are
selling gold, said  Suki Cooper , an analyst with Barclays Capital
in New York, in an e-mailed report today.  “Outside of the IMF sales, little other selling has
materialized with the Euro-system banks selling remaining
subdued,” Cooper said. “Gold’s price reaction was muted in
response to the news, but in the absence of the IMF sales, the
sector is set to swing into a net buyer of gold.”  Gold also advanced as the dollar weakened. The U.S. Dollar
Index, a gauge against six counterparts, dropped as much as 0.5
percent today. Gold usually move inversely to the dollar.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at
$29.3625 an ounce. The metal, which gained 74 percent this year,
is likely to rise more than gold in 2011 as industrial demand
strengthens,  Credit Agricole SA  said in a report yesterday.  Platinum rose $5.90, or 0.3 percent, to $1,733 an ounce and
palladium gained $4.20, or 0.6 percent, to $757.25 an ounce.  -- With assistance from  Sandrine Rastello  in Washington. Editor:
