German two-year government note
 yields  fell to the lowest in almost two weeks after the European
Central Bank lent 149.5 billion euros ($196 billion) to banks,
signaling continued stress in the financial industry.  Greek 10-year yields were little changed after Fitch
Ratings said it may cut Greece’s credit ranking to non-
investment grade, underpinning demand for the safest assets.
Fitch said late yesterday it expects a review of Greece’s
“fiscal sustainability” to be conducted in January, and
there’s a “heightened probability” of a downgrade.  “The ECB lent slightly more than we were expecting,” said
 Mohit Kumar , a fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank AG in
London. “Downgrades may continue into the New Year. We need to
see a concerted response from the euro area. Otherwise the
negative sentiment is likely to continue.”  German two-year yields fell eight basis points to
0.96 percent as of 2:16 p.m. in London. The 1 percent security
due December 2012 rose 0.150, or 1.5 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 100.07. Ten-year yields were four basis points lower
at 2.95 percent.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said 270 banks asked for the three-
month funds over 98 days, which will be loaned at its average
benchmark interest rate over the period. Banks tomorrow need to
repay 96.9 billion euros in maturing 12-month loans and
38.2 billion euros in three-month loans on the following day.  Liquidity Needs  “Banks’ liquidity needs are still pretty high and they
remain dependent on the ECB,” said  Ulf Kraus , a fixed-income
strategist at Helaba Trust GmbH in Frankfurt. “The crisis is
not over yet and today’s figure shows that the ECB took the
right decision to continue with the full allotment.”  Moody’s Investors Service put Portugal’s A1 long-term and
Prime-1 short-term government bond ratings on watch yesterday,
saying the rankings may be cut a level or two because of the
economy’s “sluggish” growth. The same agency cut Ireland’s
credit ranking five levels on Dec. 17.  Greek 10-year government bond yields were three basis
points higher at 12.18 percent. Equivalent-maturity Portuguese
bond yields were one basis point higher, at 6.75 percent.
Spanish 10-year bonds advanced, pushing the yield down six basis
points to 5.5 percent and Italian yields were at 4.67 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
