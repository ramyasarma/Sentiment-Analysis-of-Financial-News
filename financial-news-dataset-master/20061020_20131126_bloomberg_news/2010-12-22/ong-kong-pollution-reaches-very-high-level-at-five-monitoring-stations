Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at five monitoring stations today, triggering
public health warnings, the Environmental Protection Department
said on its website.  The pollution index topped 100 at all three roadside
stations for a third consecutive day, reading 174 in Causeway
Bay and 141 in Central and Mong Kok as of 7 a.m., the department
said. Pollution topped 100 in the outlying general stations of
Kwai Chung and Sham Shui Po, the department said.  Roadside pollution readings above 100 trigger a government
warning for people with heart or respiratory ailments to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas. Readings that high at
general monitoring stations trigger a warning for people with
those illnesses to reduce outdoor activities and seek medical
advice before participating in sports  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
