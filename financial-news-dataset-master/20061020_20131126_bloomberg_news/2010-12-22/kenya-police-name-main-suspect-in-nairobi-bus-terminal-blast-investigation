Kenyan police named Albert John
Olando Molanda as the main suspect in a Dec. 20 bomb blast in
the capital, Nairobi, which killed three people including
Molanda.  The explosion at a bus station was caused by an F1 Russian-
made grenade, Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said in an e-
mailed statement late yesterday. Molanda is a 35-year-old
Tanzanian national, the Nairobi-based  Daily Nation  reported
today, citing Iteere.  The blast occurred as passengers were being screened before
boarding a bus heading for Uganda’s capital, Kampala, injuring
at least 30 people. Ugandan police yesterday blamed Al-Shabaab,
the Somali Islamist group, for the attack which takes place five
months after they claimed responsibility for bomb blasts in
Kampala that killed 76 people.  To contact the reporters on this story:
