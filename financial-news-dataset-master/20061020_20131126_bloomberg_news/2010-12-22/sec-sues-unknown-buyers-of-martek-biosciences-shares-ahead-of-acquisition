Unknown buyers of  Martek Biosciences
Corp.  options were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over claims they traded on inside information of
 Royal DSM NV ’s acquisition of the company.  The SEC said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan that the unknown purchasers used an anonymous
UBS AG account to buy 2,615 call options on Martek stock from
Dec. 10 to Dec. 15 and then sold the options on Dec. 21, the
same day the acquisition was announced. Martek, based in
Columbia, Maryland, develops products made from microalgae.  “As a result, the unknown purchasers are in a position to
realize total profits of approximately $1.2 million from the
sale of call options,” the agency said in its complaint.  Royal DSM , a chemical company based in Heerlen,
Netherlands, said it would pay $1 billion, or $31.50 a share,
for all outstanding Martek common stock, a 35 percent premium
over the previous day’s closing price, according to the SEC. The
SEC said there was no publicly available information about the
Martek acquisition before it was announced.  The SEC is seeking an order blocking the buyers from
violating U.S. securities law and requiring them to turn over
the profits and pay civil fines.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. One or
More Unknown Purchasers of Securities of Martek Biosciences
Corp., 10-cv-09527, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
