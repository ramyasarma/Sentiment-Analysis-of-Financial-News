The International Monetary Fund’s
executive board has "informally" approved Poland’s request to
extend its Flexible Credit Line and increase the limit to $29
billion, the country’s  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mail.  In July, the IMF approved Poland’s $21 billion credit line
for one year, which authorities have said they intend to treat
as precautionary. The following month, the agency changed rules
to the facility, which is reserved for countries that qualify
based on economic fundamentals.  Poland, which is taking advantage of new rules to the IMF’s
credit line program designed to encourage countries to turn to
the fund before crises develop, "doesn’t intend to use the
credit line," the ministry said in the statement today.  John Lipsky , the IMF’s No. 2 official, yesterday said he
plans to "move ahead rapidly in seeking approval" from the
Washington-based lender’s board of Poland’s request to adjust to
the credit line’s new rule as the country’s economic "growth is
projected to remain solid and balanced," according to an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
