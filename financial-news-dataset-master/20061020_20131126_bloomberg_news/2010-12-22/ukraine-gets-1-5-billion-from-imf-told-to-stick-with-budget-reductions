The  International Monetary Fund 
agreed to disburse $1.5 billion to Ukraine and urged the
government to stick to planned budget cuts after reviewing the
country’s progress in meeting terms of a $15.3 billion loan.  “Fiscal adjustment remains at the core of the program,”
First Managing Director  John Lipsky  said in an e-mailed
statement after a meeting today by the IMF board. “Swift
approval of the 2011 budget consistent with program targets,
along with tight control over budget execution and efforts to
improve tax administration, will be crucial.”  The IMF agreed in July to provide a 29-month loan to
Ukraine, the country’s second bailout in two years after the
global financial crisis cut demand for its exports and the
economy shrank 15.1 percent in 2009.  The government agreed to narrow its budget deficit to 3.08
percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 5.5 percent this
year and pledged to raise the retirement age over the next
decade, according to a draft law submitted by the government to
the parliament.  Changes to the pension system, public administration and
state-owned companies will be key for longer-term fiscal
sustainability, Lipsky said.  Ukraine should “expedite the implementation of measures
necessary to tackle the problem of sizeable impaired assets in
the banking system” hindering the financial sector’s support to
“a sustainable economic recovery,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
