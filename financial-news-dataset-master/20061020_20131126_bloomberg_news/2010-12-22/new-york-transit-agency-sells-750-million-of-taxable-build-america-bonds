New York’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, operator of the biggest U.S. mass-
transit system, sold $750 million of taxable Build America
Bonds, more than doubling the offering to meet investor demand.  The authority issued about $552 million in 30-year
securities, which were priced to yield 6.81 percent, or 233
basis points over comparable Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a spread of 275 basis
points on 30-year debt in the transit agency’s June sale. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “Demand for the bonds greatly exceeded the amount
initially offered,” Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the MTA,
said in an e-mail. “We increased the size of the offering to
meet supply with pricing that will provide the MTA with savings
related to assumptions in our approved budget.”  The MTA had planned to sell $350 million in Build Americas,
which include a 35 percent federal subsidy on interest costs,
according to preliminary offering documents. Last week, the
agency’s financing committee approved increasing the issue to as
much as $750 million.  The Build America Bond program, part of President Barack
Obama’s stimulus package, is set to end on Dec. 31. Issuers
across the U.S. moved up planned sales to this month to take
advantage of the expiring subsidy, making the last three months
of 2010 the biggest quarter for Build Americas since the program
began in April 2009, Bloomberg data show.  The MTA issue represents about half of the new-money
financing the authority planned for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
