The benchmark index for U.S. stock
 options  fell to a three-year low as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index moved in its narrowest range since April 2007 and rose for
a fifth day to reach a two-year high.  The  VIX , as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index  is known, fell 6.3 percent to 15.45 as of 4:15 p.m. in New
York. That’s below the prior 2010 closing low of 15.58 on April
12, and the lowest closing level since  July 2007 . The index
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the  S&P 500 , which rose 0.3 percent and moved in a 0.35
percentage-point range between today’s intraday high and low,
less than half the 0.83 average over the past four weeks.  “We’re having a wind-down in the market as we close down
the year and we’re seeing small percentage moves in the
market,” said  Dan Deming , a VIX options trader at Stutland
Equities LLC on the CBOE floor. “People are looking at the
timeline for the next couple weeks and, barring any unforeseen
thing, the sense is that most people are done playing in the
market. You can really feel the lack of activity on the floor.”  Ten-day  realized volatility , a gauge of past price swings,
for the S&P 500 has fallen to 5.92, near the four-year low of
4.56 that it reached Nov. 2 -- a decline of more than two-thirds
from this year’s peak of 37.86 in May.  VIX futures  retreated. February’s contracts slumped 0.5
percent to 21.30, while April’s lost 0.4 percent to 23.80. The
VIX trades 7.5 points below its three-month future, the  widest
spread  in two months.  The index has tumbled by two-thirds from  this year ’s peak
of 45.79 in May, and is almost a third below this year’s average
of 22.68. The volatility gauge has averaged 20.40 over its two-
decade history.  “VIX is pricing in the quiet that we will see until next
week,” said  Chris Rich , head options strategist at JonesTrading
Institutional Services LLC in Chicago. “You can hear the
premium hiss out of the options.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
