Hong Kong said a chicken carcass
found on the island of Lantau tested positive for the H5 virus.  The carcass was found on the seashore on Dec 18, and
officials are investigating how it may have got there, according
to a government  statement . There are no poultry farms within
three kilometers of where the dead chicken was found and no
evidence of poultry kept illegally in backyards in neighboring
villages, the statement said.  Hong Kong lowered its bird flu warning on Dec. 8, after it
was issued last month when a 59-year-old woman caught the
disease following a trip to China, according to a statement that
day. The response level was reduced to “alert” from
“serious,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
