British Land Co. , the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, and the property arm of
Canada’s  Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System  completed
a joint-venture agreement to build a 47-story office tower in
London.  The Leadenhall Building, known as the Cheesegrater because
of its shape, will be completed in mid-2014 at a cost of 340
million pounds ($526 million), British Land and Toronto-based
partner Oxford Properties Group Inc. said in a statement today.
The Richard Rogers-designed building will be built in the City
of London financial district.  British Land has contributed the site, worth about 90
million pounds. Oxford will pay the next 90 million pounds to
prepare and start the development. The remaining costs will be
split, said British Land, which will pay a total of around 125
million pounds in addition to the land.  Developers including British Land and Land Securities Group
Plc have revived plans this year to build towers in the district
after cancelling them two years ago because of the global
financial crisis. A shortage of development has pushed up rents
as demand for modern office space picks up.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
