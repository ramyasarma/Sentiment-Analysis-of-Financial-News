New Zealand’s dollar reached a 10-
year low against Australia’s currency before a government report
that economists said will show the smaller nation’s economy
almost stalled in the third quarter.  The kiwi weakened against most of its 16 major counterparts
after data showed New Zealand’s current-account deficit widened
as exports declined. Australia’s currency was close to a seven-
month high against the yen after an index of leading indicators
for the South Pacific nation’s economy increased.  “I’m relatively bearish on the kiwi,” said  Masashi Murata , vice president of foreign exchange in Tokyo at BBH
Investment Services Inc., a unit of New York-based Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. “New Zealand fails to benefit from
increasing demand in emerging markets, which in turn diminishes
expectations for domestic consumption and an interest-rate
hike.”  New Zealand’s dollar dropped 0.5 percent to NZ$1.3466 per
Aussie as of 11:36 a.m. in New York from NZ$1.3406 yesterday in
New York, after dropping to NZ$1.3470 earlier, the weakest since
September 2000. New Zealand’s currency was at 74.29 U.S. cents
from 74.42 cents, and bought 62.05 yen from 62.31 yen.  The Australian dollar gained 0.3 percent to 1.0006 U.S.
cents from 99.79 cents, and traded at 83.52 yen from 83.56 yen,
after rising to 83.69 yen on Dec. 14, the strongest since May
13.  New Zealand’s gross domestic product rose 0.1 percent in
the three months to Sept. 31 from the prior quarter, according
to a Bloomberg survey before a report scheduled for 4:45 p.m.
New York time. The economy grew 0.2 percent in the three months
ended June 30. Statistics New Zealand said the current-account
deficit widened to NZ$1.77 billion ($1.31 billion) last quarter,
from NZ$987 million the prior period.  Australia’s index of future economic growth rose 0.3
percent in October, Westpac Banking Corp. and the Melbourne
Institute said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
