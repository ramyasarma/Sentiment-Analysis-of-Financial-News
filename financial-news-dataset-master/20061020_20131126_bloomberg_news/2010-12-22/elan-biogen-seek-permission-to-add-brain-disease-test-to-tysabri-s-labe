(Corrects first paragraph to clarify that label change
request isn’t related to blood test and corrects number of PML
cases in fourth paragraph.)  Elan Corp.  and  Biogen Idec Inc .
asked U.S. and EU regulators for permission to change the label
of the multiple sclerosis medicine Tysabri to tell doctors and
patients that signs of a virus are a risk factor for developing
a serious brain illness.  The filings are part of the companies’ efforts to identify
and address potential risk factors for the illness, known as
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or PML, in Tysabri-
treated patients, Biogen and Dublin-based Elan, its partner,
said in a statement today.  Separately, the companies are developing a blood test that
can detect the presence of an antibody to the JC virus, which
causes PML. The test is being studied in clinical trials, said
Kate Weiss, a Biogen spokeswoman.  Tysabri, which generated $1.1 billion in sales in 2009, has
been linked to 79 cases of PML, as of Dec. 2, according to
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen. Researchers theorize that
Tysabri may subdue defenses meant to keep the virus out of the
brain.  In February, the Food and Drug Administration updated
Tysabri’s labeling to clarify the medicine’s risks. The number
of infections and deaths from PML remains about 1 in 1,000
overall. The rate is higher outside the U.S., with 2 of every
1,000 patients contracting the illness. The reason for the
difference is unknown, the FDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
