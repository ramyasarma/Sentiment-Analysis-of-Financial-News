Vodacom Group Ltd. , South Africa’s
biggest provider of mobile-phone service, may explore the sale
of its Democratic Republic of Congo unit as a dispute with a
shareholder over funding drags on.  “One potential outcome is the sale of the business,”
Richard Boorman, spokesman for the Johannesburg-based company
controlled by  Vodafone Group Plc. , said in an interview today.  Vodacom’s wholly owned Congolese unit, which owns 51
percent of Vodacom Congo SPRL, has agreed with its partner,
Congolese Wireless Network SPRL, to explore options for the
business, it said in a statement today. The mobile operator is
seeking an agreement with CWN for a $484 million capital
increase.  “It’s a loss-making business and there have been disputes
between CWN and Vodacom,” David Lerche, analyst at
Johannesburg-based Avior Research Ltd., said in an interview.  “There’s been no capital investment there for a long time
because of the dispute,” said Lerche, who has a "sell"
recommendation on Vodacom. “It’s a stagnating business.”  Vodacom will exit the Congo if the dispute “takes years”
to resolve, Chief Executive Officer Pieter Uys said on July 22.  Vodacom said on Nov. 8 that revenue for its international
unit, which includes Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania,
Lesotho, Mozambique and Zambia, fell 10 percent in the six
months through September.  South African rival  MTN Group Ltd.  is the continent’s
biggest provider of mobile services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
