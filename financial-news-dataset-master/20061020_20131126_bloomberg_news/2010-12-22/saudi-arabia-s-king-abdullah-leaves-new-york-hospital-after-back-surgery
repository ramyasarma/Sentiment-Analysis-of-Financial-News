Saudi Arabia’s  King Abdullah  left a
New York hospital yesterday after receiving treatment and will
move to his U.S. residence, the official Saudi Press Agency
reported today citing a Royal Court statement.  The king will stay in his New York residence to recuperate
and receive physical therapy, the Riyadh-based  news service 
said. It didn’t say when he will return to Saudi Arabia. Saudi
state television showed footage of the 86-year-old monarch
walking out of his hospital room.  The statement from the Royal Court was the first on the
king’s condition since Dec. 3, when he underwent a second
operation to repair several vertebrae. King Abdullah arrived in
New York on Nov. 23 and had surgery the next day at New York
Presbyterian Hospital to remove a blood clot and adjust a
slipped disk, the  Saudi Embassy in Washington  said.  The king delegated the management of the affairs of the
world’s largest oil supplier to his half-brother,  Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz , during his absence, SPA said Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
