The euro traded near a three-week
low against the dollar on concern European banks and nations
will need to raise more funds, adding to signs the region’s debt
crisis may be prolonged.  Europe’s currency is heading for a weekly loss against 14
of its 16 major counterparts as the European Central Bank will
lend banks 149.5 billion euros ($195.9 billion) for three months
to meet their liquidity needs over the year-end period. New
Zealand’s dollar rose versus Australia’s on speculation the so-
called kiwi’s recent drop was too rapid.  “When you start to stare in the face of funding
requirements out of the euro nations, the ones that are in
trouble in particular, that can’t help an already poor
situation,” said  Alex Sinton , a senior currency dealer at ANZ
National Bank Ltd. in Auckland. “The bias has got to be on the
downside for the euro and the upside for the dollar.”  The euro traded at $1.3114 as of 9:59 a.m. in Singapore
from $1.3100 in New York yesterday, after declining to $1.3074
on Dec. 21, the lowest level since Dec. 2. The currency was at
109.38 yen from 109.47 yen. The yen climbed to 83.44 per dollar
from 83.57 after touching 83.38, the strongest since Dec. 14.  New Zealand’s currency advanced to NZ$1.3453 per Australian
dollar from NZ$1.3489 yesterday. It rose 0.4 percent to 74.31
U.S. cents from 74.02 cents. The financial markets in Japan are
closed for a public holiday today.  The ECB said yesterday 270 banks asked for the unlimited
funds over 98 days, which will be loaned at its average
benchmark interest rate over the period. Banks today need to
repay 96.9 billion euros in maturing 12-month loans and 38.2
billion euros in three-month loans tomorrow.  Poland is seeking to replace its $21 billion credit line at
the  International Monetary Fund  with a two-year, $29 billion
one, John Lipsky, the IMF’s No. 2 official, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
