Naiade Resorts Ltd. , a Mauritian
hotel operator, climbed the most in 11 weeks after  New Mauritius
Hotels Ltd. , the nation’s biggest leisure group by market value,
said it expects growth to improve, boosting industry prospects.  The stock added the most since Oct. 5, rising 1.4 rupees,
or 6.5 percent, to 22.9 rupees by the 1:30 p.m. close in Port
Louis, the capital.  New Mauritius Hotels’ earnings for the first quarter
through December are expected to be around 10 percent more than
last year’s and “based on the present positive trend in
bookings in the high season, the second quarter is also likely
to produce better results than those realized last year,” the
company said in a  statement  on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s
website yesterday.  “Investors deduced that it would be same for other hotel
counters,” Vikash Tulsidas, manager at Port Louis-based AXYS
Stockbroking Ltd., said in a phone interview today from the
city. “Following the panic sell of Naiade last week, there was
renewed interest for this stock as sellers dried up on the
market, hence the price increase.”  The stock lost 14 percent of its value from Dec. 8 to Dec.
17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mauritius earns most of its foreign currency from tourism
and exports of sugar, clothing and textiles. The country raised
its forecast for an increase in tourist arrivals in 2010 to 5.6
percent in November from a previous estimate of 5 percent. The
Indian Ocean island country is expected to attract 920,000
tourists this year compared with 871,356 in 2009.  Visitors from Europe represent 64 percent of total tourist
arrivals, with 31 percent of the total traveling from France,
the data office said. Tourism revenue is set to increase 2.8
percent to 39 billion rupees ($1.3 billion), it said, citing the
Bank of Mauritius.  To contact the reporter on this story:
