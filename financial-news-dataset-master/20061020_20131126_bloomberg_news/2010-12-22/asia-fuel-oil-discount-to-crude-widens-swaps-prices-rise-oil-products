Asia fuel oil’s discount to crude
widened, signaling worsening processing losses in Singapore, the
region’s biggest oil-trading center. Gasoil swaps rose even as
the crack spread narrowed.  Crude futures climbed for a fourth day in New York, topping
$90 a barrel on speculation the U.S. economic recovery will
stoke demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. China raised
gasoline and diesel prices to curb inflation.  Fuel Oil  The  discount  of Singapore high-sulfur fuel oil to Dubai
crude, the Asian benchmark, widened 58 cents to $11.06 a barrel,
the steepest since Jan. 6, 2009, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates, a brokerage. Refiners’ losses from making the
residue have worsened 52 percent so far this month as an
increase in processing leads to a supply glut.  Fuel oil  swaps for January increased $1.75, or 0.3 percent,
to $515.50 a metric ton, the highest since Oct. 3, 2008.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $10 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread  was at the narrowest in a week, indicating bunker, or
marine fuel, has lagged behind gains in higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  January swaps for  gasoil , or diesel, rose 45 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $103.20 a barrel, according to PVM. The product’s
premium to Dubai crude declined 39 cents to $12.84 a barrel, PVM
said. This  crack spread , a measure of refining profit, was at
the narrowest since Nov. 26.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 20 cents to $1.40 a
barrel, the highest since Dec. 2, based on PVM data. A widening
 regrade  shows it’s more profitable for refiners to produce
aviation fuel than diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan’s benchmark open-specification naphtha forward
contracts for first-half February delivery were bid at $881 a
ton against offers at $884, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte, a broker. That’s up from $871.75 yesterday, which
was the highest close since Sept. 15, 2008.  Naphtha’s crack spread to Brent crude dropped $1.73 to
$167.85 a ton, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
difference has narrowed from $171.18 at the end of November.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday fell to $5.95 a
barrel, Bloomberg calculations showed. This  reforming margin  was
at the narrowest since Dec. 2, meaning motor fuel is less
profitable to produce compared with naphtha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
