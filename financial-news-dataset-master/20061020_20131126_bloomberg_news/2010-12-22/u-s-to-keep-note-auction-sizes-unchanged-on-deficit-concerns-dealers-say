The  Treasury  will sell $99 billion of
two-, five- and seven-year notes next week for a third straight
month amid prospects for a rising budget deficit, according to
the Federal Reserve’s primary dealers.  The U.S. had scaled back auction sizes after earlier
expanding debt sales to finance annual budget deficits exceeding
$1 trillion. It sold $118 billion in two-, five- and seven-year
debt at each of six monthly sales of the three maturities from
November 2009 through April. The $858 billion bill President
Barack Obama signed Dec. 17 extending tax cuts for two years
spurred speculation federal borrowing will need to increase.  “The Treasury had been cutting issue sizes, but there is
no room to cut further given that the budget will be higher than
it would have been a few months ago before the tax
legislation,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-rate strategist
in New York at BNP Paribas SA, which as a primary dealer is
required to bid at Treasury auctions. “It’s going to be very
hard for them to cut amounts any time soon.”  The government will auction $35 billion in two-year debt,
$35 billion in five-year notes and $29 billion in seven-year
securities, unchanged from last month’s sales, according to all
13 respondents in a Bloomberg News survey of the Fed’s 18
primary dealers. The Treasury will announce the amounts tomorrow
at 11 a.m. New York time. The sales will be on three consecutive
days beginning Dec. 27.  The deficit was $150.4 billion last month, exceeding the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
compared with $120.3 billion in November 2009, according to a
Treasury Department budget statement released in Washington.  Obama’s deal with congressional Republicans to extend tax
cuts will expand the federal budget deficit to $1.34 trillion
for fiscal 2011, Credit Suisse Group AG strategists estimated on
Dec. 7, a day after the president announced the agreement.  The  shortfalls  were $1.29 trillion in fiscal 2010 and $1.42
trillion in fiscal 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
