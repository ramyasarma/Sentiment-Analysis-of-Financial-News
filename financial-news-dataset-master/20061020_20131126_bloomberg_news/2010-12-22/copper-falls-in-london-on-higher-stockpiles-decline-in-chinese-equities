Copper futures fluctuated in New
York after reports showed the U.S. economy and sales of existing
homes expanded less than forecast, while house prices rose in
October from the previous month.  The world’s biggest economy expanded at a 2.6 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, data from the Commerce
Department showed, less than the median forecast for a 2.8
percent gain in gross domestic product in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Purchases of existing homes increased 5.6 percent in
November from the prior month to a 4.68 million annual rate, the
National Association of Realtors said in Washington. Economists
projected sales would rise to a 4.75 million pace. Home prices
rose 0.7 percent from September, the Federal Housing Finance
Agency said.  “GDP was neutral,”  William Adams , an analyst at
Basemetals.com in London, said in an e-mail. “The figure I
think the market will latch onto is the rise in the House Price
Index. Higher house prices will restore confidence with
households -- the backbone of the U.S. economy.”  Copper for delivery in March fell 0.6 cent, or 0.1 percent,
to $4.27 a pound at 10:55 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
earlier today touching a record $4.2965. Copper for delivery in
three months lost 0.2 percent to $9,350 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange. The metal reached a record $9,392 a ton
in London yesterday.  ‘Tight Market’  The revised increase in U.S. GDP compared with a 2.5
percent estimate issued last month. The 0.7 percent increase in
home prices compared with a projection by economists for a 0.2
percent decline from the prior month, according to the median of
13 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Prices fell 3.4 percent in
October from a year earlier.  Construction accounts for a quarter of copper demand,
according to the Copper Development Association. The U.S. is the
second-biggest copper user, after China.  “Against a better demand outlook for next year, supply
forecasts point to a tight market and higher prices in early
2011,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at UralSib Financial
Corp. in Moscow, said in a report today. Gains in the metal will
be “positive for other industrial metals, as copper tends to
dictate the directional trend,” he wrote.  The International Copper Study Group is expecting a
435,000-ton global deficit in the refined metal next year.  The Collahuasi copper mine in Chile, the world’s third-
biggest, said Dec. 20 it won’t ship the metal from the northern
Patache port until further notice after an accident shut down
the port. A monthlong strike at Collahuasi helped drive copper
prices to a record earlier this month.  Tin for three-month delivery on the LME fell 0.9 percent to
$26,650 a ton. Nickel lost 0.5 percent to $24,500 a ton and zinc
slid 0.2 percent to $2,325 a ton. Aluminum gained 0.9 percent to
$2,456.50 a ton and lead rose 0.5 percent to $2,445 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
