Ireland’s government may ask a
Dublin court to allow an immediate capital injection into Allied
Irish Banks Plc, two people familiar with the situation said.
The state may seek the court’s permission as soon as today or
tomorrow, the people said.                    Allied Irish needs to raise a total of 3.7 billion euros by
the end of the year to reach minimum capital standards, the
European Commission said yesterday. Under new laws enacted
yesterday, a court order allows for a capital injection without
shareholder approval. A spokeswoman for Allied Irish declined to
comment, while spokesmen for the Finance Ministry, the Central
Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency also declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
