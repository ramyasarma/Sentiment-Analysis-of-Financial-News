Japan’s benchmark bond  yields  will
be capped at 1.5 percent next year as the central bank keeps
interest rates near zero to counter deflation, Tokyo-based
analysts predict.  The 10-year yield will end 2011 at 1.325 percent, the
median forecast in the survey of 16 analysts shows, compared
with today’s 1.15 percent. Nine of those surveyed expect the
rate to fall below 1 percent at some stage during the year as
the Bank of Japan keeps an accommodative monetary policy to help
counter deflation.  “With the central bank remaining cautious about the
outlook for the economy and prices, I can’t see any factors that
may lead to a surge in long-term yields,” said  Jun Ishii , chief
fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., who forecasts the 10-year rate will end next
year at 1.3 percent.  Japan’s bond yields are the lowest in the world, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg covering 32 markets, even after
10-year rates have climbed more than a quarter percentage point
from this year’s low in October. A total of 908.8 trillion yen
($10.8 trillion) of so-called JGBs are outstanding, making them
the world’s largest debt market.  Ten-year  yields  started this year at 1.285 percent before
reaching their 2010 high of 1.405 percent on April 7. They then
slumped to a seven-year low as 0.82 percent on Oct. 6 as
speculation the global recovery was waning boosted debt demand.
Rates climbed as high as 1.295 percent on Dec. 15 as that
concern waned.  The last time yield were above 1.5 percent was June 2009.  BOJ Commitment  The Bank of Japan’s commitment to keep interest rates low
leaves limited room for yields to rise further, according to
 Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist at Okasan Securities Co.  “I don’t think long-term yields will rise sharply because
the BOJ will keep its monetary policy loose,” Bandou said.
“Gains in yields will likely be limited even if the economy
recovers.”  Bandou predicts the 10-year yield will fall as low as 1
percent during the year before ending 2011 at 1.5 percent.  BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  and his policy board cut the
key overnight lending rate to a range of zero to 0.1 percent on
Oct. 5, and pledged to keep it there until they can forecast
stable prices.  Asset Purchases  The central bank is buying government debt, corporate bonds,
real-estate investment trusts and exchange-traded funds to pump
money into financial markets and keep borrowing costs low. The
central bank will “steadily” provide additional liquidity,
Shirakawa said after a policy meeting yesterday where he kept
the benchmark rate unchanged.  BOJ policy makers in October forecast consumer prices
excluding fresh food will rise 0.1 percent in the year starting
April 1 after falling this year. Core prices declined for a 20th
month in October, the statistics bureau said Nov. 26.  A revision of the base year used to calculate consumer
prices scheduled for August 2011 may make it difficult for the
BOJ to exit its zero-rate policy. The previous revision pushed
down price data, leading to a decline in bond yields.  While there may be an increase in growth signs in the first
half of 2011, the market’s concern will shift in the second half
to whether the recovery is sustainable, holding down bond yields,
said  Chotaro Morita , chief strategist at Barclays Capital Japan
Ltd. in Tokyo.  Ten-year rates will end 2011 at 0.9 percent, he predicts.  Benchmark yields will end next year at 1.25 percent,
according to a separate Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts with the
most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
