U.S. credit-card delinquencies fell
in November to the lowest in almost three years as the six
biggest issuers posted improved numbers, according to Moody’s
Investors Service.  Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal of future write-
offs, dropped for the 13th consecutive month to 4.38 percent,
the lowest since December 2007, Moody’s said today in a report.
Loans delinquent 30 to 59 days, the earliest sign of trouble,
declined to 1.14 percent, near an all-time low. Write-offs for
loans deemed uncollectible, a lagging indicator, fell to 8.58
percent from October’s 8.79 percent.  The drop in new delinquencies bolsters the firm’s
“expectation that charge-offs will ultimately break below the 7
percent mark later in 2011,” Jeffrey Hibbs, a Moody’s analyst,
wrote in the report.  The top six U.S. credit-card issuers, including  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. ,  Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc. , all
reported lower delinquencies for November in regulatory filings
earlier this month. Write-offs climbed at JPMorgan and McLean,
Virginia-based Capital One Financial Corp. They fell at the
other four, including American Express Co. and Discover
Financial Services, based in Riverwoods, Illinois.  To contact the reporter on this story:
