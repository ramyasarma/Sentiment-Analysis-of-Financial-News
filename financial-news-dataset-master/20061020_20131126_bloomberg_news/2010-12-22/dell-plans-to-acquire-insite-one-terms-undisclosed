Dell Inc.  agreed to buy software
company InSite One Inc. to offer health-care customers programs
that archive medical records and share images.  Terms of the deal for Wallingford, Connecticut-based InSite
One weren’t disclosed, Dell said today in a statement.  Dell has sought to  acquire  providers of so-called cloud-
computing services as companies increasingly use software and
content from the Web, cutting the cost of maintaining their own
servers and data centers.  InSite  One manages almost 55 million
clinical studies, 3.6 billion medical images and supports 800
clinical sites. It will give Dell a storage-as-a service
platform for companies in other industries as well, Dell said.  Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, fell 3 cents to $13.81 at
10:40 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The
stock had dropped 3.6 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
