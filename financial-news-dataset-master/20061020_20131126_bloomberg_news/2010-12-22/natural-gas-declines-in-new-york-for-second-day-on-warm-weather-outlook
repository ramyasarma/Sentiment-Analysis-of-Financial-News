Natural gas futures climbed for a
third day in four after a revised forecast showed colder weather
that may boost demand for the heating fuel.  Gas futures rose after a midday  update  to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Global Forecast System
showed colder weather in the central and eastern U.S. in early
January than had previously been predicted.  “The weather models have turned cooler,” said  Kyle Cooper , an analyst with IAF Advisors in Houston. “If the
contract settles above $4, that’s going to be a positive signal
psychologically for the market.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose 9.3 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $4.152 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling to $3.988. Gas
has dropped 0.7 percent this month and 25 percent this year.  The low temperature in Chicago on Jan. 2 may be 13 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 11 Celsius), 4 degrees below normal, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania.  “There’s a more volatile pattern in the 11- to 15-day
outlook,” said  Matt Rogers , the president of Commodity Weather
Group in Bethesda, Maryland. “There’s a strong cold shot in the
middle of the country right around New Year’s Day.”  Heating demand in the U.S. from Dec. 28 through Jan. 1 may
be 8 percent above normal, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Inventory Draw  The department may report a larger-than-average withdrawal
from U.S. gas inventories tomorrow after cold weather in the
eastern U.S. last week, according to the median of 14 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The data may show a reduction
in stockpiles of 180 billion cubic feet, compared with a five-
year average of 136 billion, the analysts predicted.  Gas in U.S. storage  totaled 3.561 trillion cubic feet for
the week ended Dec. 10, 9.9 percent above the five-year average
and 1 percent below last year’s level.  U.S. natural gas output may reach a record high of 62.09
billion cubic feet a day this year, the Energy Department said
in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  report Dec. 7.  Gas stockpiles will total 1.833 trillion cubic feet at the
end of the winter heating season in March, about 171 billion
cubic feet higher than at the end of March 2010, the department
said in the report.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,
Louisiana fell 15.48 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $4.0107 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
217,852 as of 2:41 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 284,000. Volume was 229,782 yesterday. Open interest was
784,807 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
787,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
