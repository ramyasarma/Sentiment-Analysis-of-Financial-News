Fidelity Investments, the world’s
second-biggest mutual-fund manager, said  Peter Cieszko  plans to
leave as head of its distribution unit next month after about
two years at the company.  Scott Couto , an executive vice president who worked under
Cieszko, has been named interim head of the unit while the firm
searches for a permanent successor,  Vin Loporchio , a spokesman
for Boston-based Fidelity, said today in a telephone interview.
Cieszko is president of Fidelity Investments Institutional
Services, which sells the firm’s funds through brokers and
advisers.  Loporchio said Cieszko plans to “pursue other
opportunities,” declining to comment further. Cieszko’s planned
departure was reported earlier today by Pensions & Investments.  Cieszko joined Fidelity in January 2009 from Evergreen
Investments after the money manager’s parent company, Wachovia
Corp., said it would be acquired by Wells Fargo & Co. He was
slated to become chief executive officer of Evergreen
Investments when he left.  Fidelity manages about $1.3 trillion in mutual funds.
Vanguard Group Inc. of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is the
largest fund company, with about $1.4 trillion assets, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
