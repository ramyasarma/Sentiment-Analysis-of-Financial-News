Cotton tumbled the most allowed by
ICE Futures U.S. on bets that demand will ebb after prices more
than doubled this year to a record.  Export sales  of upland cotton by the U.S., the world’s
biggest shipper, dropped 35 percent in the week ended Dec. 9
from a week earlier, Department of Agriculture data showed. The
14-day relative-strength index, a gauge of price momentum, was
above 70 in the three previous sessions, indicating prices were
poised to drop.  “The market has been overbought,” said  Scott Joss , the
president of ClearTrade Inc. in Chicago. Prices at current
levels may curb exports, he said.  Cotton futures for March delivery fell by the exchange
limit of 5 cents, or 3.1 percent, to close at $1.5412 a pound at
2:36 p.m. in New York, the biggest drop since Nov. 26. The price
reached a record $1.5912 yesterday.  Inventories  held in warehouses monitored by ICE have
climbed for five straight sessions to the highest level since
July 15.  “It’s emotional,” Joss said. “I won’t be surprised to
see another day of ‘limit down’ tomorrow.”  Prices may fall to $1.27 by the end of the year before
rebounding, he said. Futures closed up by the daily exchange
limit in the previous three sessions.  Cotton is heading for the biggest annual gain since 1973
after global supplies failed to keep pace with rising demand
from China, the largest consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
