Nigeria moved the families of its
diplomats in Ivory Coast’s main city, Abidjan, to neighboring
Ghana “following the escalation of tension and clashes” in the
country, a spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.  The Nigerian mission in Abidjan is open only for
“essential services,” the spokesman, Ozo Nwobu, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Ivory Coast has been left with two governments since
incumbent  Laurent Gbagbo  refused to resign after the country’s
electoral commission named  Alassane Ouattara  the winner of a
disputed presidential election on Nov. 28. Ouattara’s win was
annulled by Ivory Coast’s Constitutional Council on Dec. 3. The
council named incumbent Gbagbo as the victor after canceling
ballots from the country’s north, alleging irregularities.  Pro-Gbagbo forces fired on marchers supporting Ouattara
last week, killing at least 50 and wounding 240, according to
the United Nations, which is protecting Ouattara’s
administration at a hotel in Abidjan. The French government
advised its citizens yesterday to leave Ivory Coast
"temporarily."  Presidents of countries in the Economic Community of West
African States will hold talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja,
on Dec. 24 to discuss developments in Ivory Coast, the regional
body said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
