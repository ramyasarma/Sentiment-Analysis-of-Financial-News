Former UBS AG banker Renzo Gadola
pleaded guilty to helping wealthy American clients hide assets
from the Internal Revenue Service, as the U.S. crackdown on
offshore tax evasion widened.  Gadola, 44, today admitted conspiring with a Swiss banker
to encourage U.S. clients who hadn’t told the IRS about their
UBS accounts to open undeclared ones at Basler Kantonalbank.
Gadola, who is cooperating with prosecutors, entered his plea in
federal court in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
