Crude rose for a fourth day as signs
of U.S. economic recovery stoked speculation that fuel demand
will increase in the world’s largest oil consumer.  Futures climbed as much as 0.5 percent to trade near the
highest in two years before a report forecast to show the U.S.
economy expanded more than estimated earlier. Holiday-season
retail sales jumped, according to data released yesterday.
Prices also gained after the American Petroleum Institute said
crude inventories shrank a fourth week.  “Oil prices have been well supported above $80 a barrel
since around October,” said  Selena Ling , head of treasury
research at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “People
are growing more confident that the U.S. is not entering a
double dip recession.”  Crude oil for February delivery rose as much as 45 cents to
$90.27 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $90.24 at 4:14 p.m. Singapore time. Prices
have climbed 14 percent this year.  Yesterday, futures gained 1.1 percent to $89.82 a barrel,
the highest settlement since Oct. 7, 2008. That was 2 cents
below a long-term resistance level on technical charts, the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop to $32.40 in December
2008 from a record high of $147.27 in July that year.  U.S. GDP grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, up from an
estimate of 2.5 percent last month, based on the median forecast
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before a Commerce Department
report.  Crude Supplies  Prices gained after the industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute reported yesterday that U.S. crude-oil supplies
declined 5.8 million barrels to 342 million last week. Gasoline
inventories dropped 2.9 million while middle distillates
increased 16,000 barrels, the API said.  “There’s no doubt that we’ve seen a tightening in the
market’s balance over the last few months,”  Ben Westmore , a
minerals and energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in
Melbourne, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “A lot of
it does depend on what you see for the demand picture going
forward.”  Crude also rose after U.S. holiday retail sales data, a key
economic indicator, advanced. Same-store sales at a selection of
U.S. retailers posted their biggest holiday jump, according to a
chain-store sales index released yesterday by the New York-based
International Council of Shopping Centers and  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc .  Heating Oil  The Department of Energy will release its own oil-inventory
report in Washington today. The data may show U.S.  crude
stockpiles  fell last week as refiners on the Gulf Coast reduced
their assets for tax savings at the end of the year, according
to a Bloomberg survey.  Supplies dropped 3.4 million barrels in the seven days
ended Dec. 17 from 346 million, based on the median  estimate  of
14 analysts. Stockpiles in the previous week slumped 9.85
million as imports fell.  Gasoline inventories may have increased 1.5 million barrels
from 214.8 million, the survey showed. Analysts were split over
whether stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, declined or gained.  Brent crude oil for February settlement rose as much as 46
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $93.66 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. It gained 46 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to end the session at $93.20 a barrel yesterday, the highest
settlement since Oct. 1, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
