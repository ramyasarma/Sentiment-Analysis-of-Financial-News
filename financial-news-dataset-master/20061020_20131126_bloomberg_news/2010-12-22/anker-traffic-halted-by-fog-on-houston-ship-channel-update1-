Houston Ship Channel pilots halted
boarding inbound and outbound vessels early today after fog
reduced visibility, according to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic
Service.  Thirty ships are waiting to enter the port and 14 are
waiting to exit, said Lieutenant Robert Cole, a watch supervisor
with the service. Pilots stopped boarding at 7:10 a.m. local
time today, he said.  “Most of the fog has cleared around the Galveston area,
but a wall of dense fog is sitting right off the coast in the
Gulf,” Cole said in a telephone interview from Houston.  Many U.S. Gulf Coast refiners receive crude supplies by
tanker. A halt to crude supply may force refiners to reduce
operating rates, possibly increasing prices for refined products
as companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts.  Sabine-Neches Ship Channel pilots halted boarding inbound
and outbound vessels late yesterday after fog reduced
visibility, according to the vessel traffic service. Eight ships
are waiting to enter the port and six are waiting to exit, said
Eddie Diaz, a watch supervisor based in Port Arthur, Texas, with
the service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
