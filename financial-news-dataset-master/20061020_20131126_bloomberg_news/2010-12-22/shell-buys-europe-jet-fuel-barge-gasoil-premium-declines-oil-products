advanced to a two-year high. The fuel’s crack, or premium to
Brent crude, narrowed.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading  changed hands from
$828 to $831 a metric ton, according to a broker monitoring
deals on the Argus Bulletin Board and on Platts. That compares
with trades yesterday from $817 to $825. Mabanaft BV and  Chevron
