Canadian stocks  rose for a second
day as energy producers rallied after the U.S. said third-
quarter economic growth was faster than it had estimated.  Suncor Energy Inc. , the country’s biggest oil and gas
producer, advanced 2.2 percent as crude climbed to the highest
level in more than two years.  Toronto-Dominion Bank , Canada’s
second-largest bank, gained 0.7 percent after it said may
continue to make acquisitions in the U.S. Barrick Gold Corp.,
the world’s largest producer, slipped 1.2 percent as the metal
fell after advancing 27 percent this year on demand for a haven
from escalating European debt.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 15.55
points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,380.7 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. That’s
the highest level since August 2008 for the gauge, which has
advanced 3.3 percent so far in December, heading for a sixth-
straight monthly gain.  “We’re in a growth environment, so it’s time to get out of
gold and move into commodities such as oil,” said  Paul Ma , who
oversees C$500 million ($493 million) as a money manager at
McLean & Partners in Calgary. “All the global economic data are
very supportive of growth this coming year, so people are
looking at the usable commodities, not things that are designed
to protect against risk such as gold.”  The Canadian benchmark gained 14 percent this year, led by
raw-materials companies, as gold and copper each jumped at least
26 percent.  Biggest Gain  Energy stocks rallied 0.9 percent as a group, the second-
most among 10 industries in the Canadian benchmark index. Crude
oil rose to the highest level in more than two years after
government reports showed that U.S.  supplies  dropped and the
country’s economy expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, up from a previous estimate of 2.5 percent issued
last month and less than the median forecast of a 2.8 percent in
a Bloomberg News survey.  Suncor advanced 2.2 percent to C$38.34. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, gained 1.2 percent to C$44.38.  Toronto-Dominion rose 0.7 percent to C$73.70. Chief
Executive Officer  Edmund Clark  said the bank may continue to
make acquisitions in the U.S. after increasing its bet there
with the $6.3 billion purchase of Chrysler Financial Corp.  The  S&P/TSX Gold Index  fell for the first time in four
days, decreasing 1.6 percent.  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer of the metal,
fell 1.2 percent to C$51.97. Goldcorp Inc., the second-largest
by market value, dropped 0.6 percent to C$45.39. Silver Wheaton
Corp., a Vancouver-based purchaser and seller of the metal,
declined 3.5 percent to C$36.94.  BCE Inc. , Canada’s biggest phone company, gained 2.3
percent to C$35.96 after it was rated “hold” in new coverage
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  Shaw Communications Inc. , which got a
“buy” rating from Stifel, advanced 0.2 percent to C$21.27.
Phone stocks rose 1 percent as a group, the most among 10
industries in the Canadian gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
