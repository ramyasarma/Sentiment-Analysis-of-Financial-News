China’s stocks rose, extending the
biggest gain in a week, as crude and copper prices jumped to
records after higher U.S. retail sales boosted confidence in the
global recovery.  PetroChina Co. Ltd. and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.
led gains for energy producers as China raised gasoline and
diesel prices by as much as 4 percent from today. Jiangxi Copper
Co. paced an advance for metal producers after copper prices
touched an all-time high in London.  “Expectations for a global economic recovery helped push
up commodity prices,” said Deng Eryong, a strategist at
Changjiang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The chain reaction may
boost investors’ confidence in the stock market and lead to a
short-term rebound.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, gained 7.26, or 0.3 percent, to
2,911.37 as of 9:36 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 Index rose 0.2
percent to 3,255.60.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
