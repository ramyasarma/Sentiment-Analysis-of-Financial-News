Japanese  stocks  rose for a second
day as oil and metal prices climbed and after U.S. shares
advanced to their levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.  Mitsui & Co. , a trading house that counts commodities as
its main source of profit, gained 1.4 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 1 publicly traded bank,
climbed 1.1 percent. Mitsui Fudosan Co., Japan’s largest
property developer by sales, jumped 3.2 percent after Credit
Suisse Group AG reported real-estate prices may be driven up by
improving liquidity. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera
maker, increased 2 percent after a newspaper reported it may
post 84 percent higher operating profit this year and as U.S.
retail sales surged.  “The world economy is recovering moderately,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. “Investors see money is flowing into stocks and
commodities, boosting confidence in the market.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.1 percent to 10,378.16
as of 12:40 p.m. in Tokyo. The Topix gained 0.2 percent to
908.20.  The Topix has  retreated  9.3 percent from its high this year
on April 15 to yesterday as Europe’s debt crisis, China’s steps
to curb property prices and concern that U.S. economic growth
may slow damped confidence in a global recovery. Shares in the
broader index were valued at 15.7 times  estimated earnings  on
average yesterday, near a four-month high.  Banks Rise  Mitsubishi UFJ climbed 1.1 percent to 443 yen and its
closest rival Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., gained 0.9
percent to 2,922.  Banks  were the biggest contributor to a gain
of the Topix among its 33 industry groups, followed by real-
estate companies.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.6 percent yesterday
in New York to 1,254.60, surpassing its closing level on Sept.
12, 2008, the last trading day before Lehman filed for
bankruptcy.  “Lehman is the poster child for the demise of the banking
industry,” said  Michael Mullaney , who helps manage $9.5 billion
at Fiduciary Trust Co. in Boston. “We’ve recovered from that.”  Same-store sales at a selection of U.S. retailers rose 4.2
percent last week, the biggest jump of this holiday season, as
more consumers finished shopping, according to a survey of
retailers released yesterday.  Property Developers  Mitsui Fudosan jumped 3.2 percent to 1,627 yen and its
closest rival Mitsubishi Estate Co. rose 2.7 percent to 1,529
yen. Sumitomo Realty & Development Co., Japan’s third-largest
developer, gained 2.5 percent to 1,990 yen.  Real-estate 
companies had the steepest advance among the Topix’s industry
groups.  Quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan “can drive up
real-estate stocks and also improve sector fundamentals in the
form of higher capital gains and asset prices,” Credit Suisse
said in a report dated yesterday.  Mitsui  increased 1.4 percent to 1,334 yen and Mitsubishi
Corp., Japan’s No. 1 commodities trader, rose 1 percent to 2,220
yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., the nation’s second-
largest oil explorer, climbed 1.3 percent to 3,060 yen.  Crude oil surged to a two-year high in New York yesterday.
Crude for February delivery rose 45 cents to $89.82 a barrel,
the highest settlement since Oct. 7, 2008. The  London Metal
Exchange Index  of six metals including copper and aluminum
climbed 1.8 percent yesterday, gaining for a third day.  “U.S. economic indicators continue to exceed expectations
and the U.S. economy is on a recovery trend,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc. “The global economic recovery, surplus money and
confidence in government measures are boosting commodity
prices.”  Biggest Drivers  Canon jumped 2 percent to 4,270 yen, contributing the most
to the Topix’s gain. Canon is the second-most-active stock by
value in Japan, following Sumitomo Mitsui Financial.  The camera maker may post an 84 percent gain in operating
profit to about 400 billion yen ($4.8 billion) this year,
benefiting from increasing sales of single-lens reflex digital
cameras, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
