The  London crosswalk  made famous
when the  Beatles  walked across it for the cover of their 1969
album “Abbey Road” was listed as a protected site by the U.K.
government.  The street crossing in the St. John’s Wood neighborhood is
the first of its kind ever to be listed as protected,  John Penrose , the U.K.’s minister for tourism and heritage, said in a
statement today.  Thousands of tourists every year flock to the Abbey Road
street crossing and adjacent  Abbey Road studios , where the
Beatles recorded most of their songs. The studio buildings were
listed as protected by the English Heritage office in February,
days after reports that owner  EMI Group Plc  was trying to sell
the site to cut debt.  “This London zebra crossing is no castle or cathedral but,
thanks to the Beatles and a 10-minute photo shoot one August
morning in 1969, it has just as strong a claim as any to be seen
as part of our heritage,” Penrose said. A crosswalk is known as
a zebra crossing in the U.K., a protected pedestrian crossing
of a road marked by zebra-like stripes.  Beatles band member  Paul McCartney  also welcomed the news,
which came a month after the group’s songs began selling on
Apple Inc.’s iTunes service.  “It’s been a great year for me and a great year for the
Beatles and hearing that the Abbey Road crossing is to be
preserved is the icing on the cake,” he said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
