Wheat futures rose the most in two
weeks on speculation that declining supplies of high-quality
grain will boost demand for shipments from the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter.  Milling-quality production in New South Wales, Victoria and
South Australia this season is expected to be half of the total
output following heavy rains, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. said in a report. From June 1 to Dec. 9, U.S. sales
of the hard red-winter variety, used to make bread and flour,
more than doubled from a year earlier,  government data  show.  “High-quality global supplies are going to be tight this
year, and that should extend U.S. export sales well into 2011,
said  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst at Prudential
Bache Commodities LLC in Chicago. “The quality concerns in
Australia will continue to provide support to U.S. futures.”  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 18.5 cents, or 2.4
percent, to close at $7.835 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since Dec. 3. Earlier, the
commodity reached $7.8525, the highest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 13.  The price has gained 45 percent this year after drought
damaged crops in Russia and Ukraine and rains reduced output in
Australia and Canada.  Futures also climbed as the United Nations’ Food and
Agriculture Organization said prospects for the global grain
harvest next year are “mixed.”  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
