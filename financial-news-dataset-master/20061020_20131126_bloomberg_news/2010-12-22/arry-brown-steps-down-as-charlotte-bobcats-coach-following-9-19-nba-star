Larry Brown  resigned as coach of the
Charlotte Bobcats amid a losing season and  Paul Silas  was made
interim coach.  Brown, 70, met with team owner  Michael Jordan  yesterday,
and they agreed a change was needed, Jordan said in a news
release. Brown, whose 1,098 regular-season wins are  sixth most 
in National Basketball Association history, led the team to a
9-19 record this season, 11 games behind the Miami Heat in the
Eastern Conference’s Southeast Division.  “I want to thank Larry for everything he has done for our
team,” Jordan said in a letter to fans on the  NBA’s website .
“He has played a key role in this organization’s development,
including coaching us to our first playoff appearance last
season.”  Brown was selected as the third coach in Bobcats history in
April 2008 and had an 88-104 record in 2½ seasons. The Bobcats
lost 99-81 to the Oklahoma City Thunder two days ago in Brown’s
last game with the team.  “The team has clearly not lived up to either of our
expectations and we both agreed that a change was necessary,”
Jordan said.  Second Time Around  Silas, 67, has a 355-400 record in 10 years as an NBA head
coach for the Charlotte Hornets, the Los Angeles Clippers and
the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Hornets moved to New Orleans in
2002 and the Bobcats entered the league in 2004.  In his four full years with the Hornets in 1999-2003,
including three in Charlotte, Silas took the team to the
playoffs each season.  Brown, who played basketball at the University of North
Carolina and won a gold medal with the U.S. team at the 1964
Olympics in Tokyo, began his coaching career at Davidson College
in 1972. In 1988, he led the University of Kansas to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association title, and was chosen
Naismith College Coach of the Year.  In the NBA, Brown has led eight different teams to the
playoffs, including the Bobcats last season. In 2001, Brown was
named NBA Coach of the Year after guiding the Philadelphia 76ers
to the finals, and three years later led the Detroit Pistons to
the NBA title. That championship, the first professional title
of his coaching career, made Brown the first coach to win both
an NBA and an NCAA title.  Brown, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in
2002, joined the Bobcats two years after being fired as coach of
the New York Knicks in 2006, when he was replaced by  Isiah Thomas .  Jordan, 47, won six NBA titles as a player with the Chicago
Bulls and became majority owner of the Bobcats in March, four
years after buying a minority stake. He is the first former NBA
player to become majority owner of a franchise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
