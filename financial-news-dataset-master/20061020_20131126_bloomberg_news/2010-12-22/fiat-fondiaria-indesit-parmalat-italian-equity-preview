Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
gained 40.79, or 0.2 percent, to 20,774.16 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Milan, bringing this week’s increase to 3.5 percent.
The Italian equity market will be closed tomorrow.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  Autogrill SpA  (AGL IM) increased 2.4 percent to 10.67
euros. The world’s biggest manager of airport and highway
restaurants won new contracts at San Francisco and Sacramento
airports and renewed a concession at Toronto airport through
HMSHost.  Fiat SpA  (F IM) rose for a fifth day, adding 1.4 percent to
15.52 euros. Centrobanca SpA increased its price estimate on the
carmaker to 18 euros from 14.50 euros and reiterated its “buy”
rating before the company splits into Fiat Industrial and Fiat
Auto on Jan. 3.  “Fiat Industrial is more appealing in the short term,
given its buoyant cash-flow generation and the potential for M&A
activity,” the brokerage said in a note. “In the long term,
Fiat Auto has greater upside potential as the integration with
Chrysler should bear fruit from mid-2012 when the new models
based on common platforms come on stream.”  Italmobiliare SpA  (ITM IM) increased 2.4 percent to 25.60
euros. The company said it will buy a 1.4 percent stake in
Mediobanca SpA and a 2.3 percent stake in RCS MediaGroup SpA
from  Italcementi SpA .  “For Italmobiliare the deal makes sense since it
simplifies group structure,” Equita Sim SpA said in a note.  Kinexia SpA  (KNX IM) jumped 8.2 percent to 2.08 euros,
snapping two days of losses. The company will target 15 million
euros ($20 million) in earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization in 2011.  Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) gained 1.1 percent to 4.59 euros,
rising for a third day this week. The company will pay 180
million euros for the free-to-air television rights for soccer
matches including the UEFA Champions League, newspaper MF
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Mediaset, which also won exclusive rights for the Europa
League, will pay almost 60 million euros a year for the period
2012-2015, MF said. Gruppo Banca Leonardo reiterated a “buy”
rating.  Parmalat SpA  (PLT IM) advanced 2.6 percent to 2.08 euros,
the highest price since April. The dairy company said GE Capital
Finance SpA agreed to pay 7.3 million euros to settle legal
claims.  Recordati SpA  (REC IM) rose 1.4 percent to 7.11 euros,
