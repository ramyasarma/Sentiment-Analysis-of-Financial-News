The U.S. auto market may increase to
13 million vehicles in 2011 from “just under” 12 million this
year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association.  “The U.S. market is recovering steadily,”  Toshiyuki Shiga ,
chairman of the association, told reporters in Tokyo today.
Demand in China, the world’s largest car market, may reach 20
million units, said Shiga, who is also chief operating officer
of  Nissan Motor Co.   Sales in China may outpace the U.S. in 2011 for a third
straight year even as the Chinese government is set to end
incentives this month that helped boost auto sales by 34 percent
to 16.4 million units this year through November.  The increase in Chinese car demand is likely to outpace
gross domestic product growth, Shiga said.  Japan’s domestic new vehicle sales will probably fall 9.9
percent next year to 4.47 million, after a government subsidy
program for fuel-efficient models ended in September, the auto
group said Dec. 17. Sales may start to recover from around next
September, Shiga said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
