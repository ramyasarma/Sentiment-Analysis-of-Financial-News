Etisalat Egypt, a unit of  Emirates
Telecommunications Corp.  of the United Arab Emirates, obtained a
7.2 billion Egyptian-pound ($1.2 billion) syndicated loan to
finance infrastructure expansion.  The banks, which include National Bank of Egypt, Banque
Misr SAE, and National Bank of Abu Dhabi, will provide 76
percent of the “long-term” financing in Egyptian pounds and
the rest in dollars, the company said today in a faxed
statement.  Emirates Telecommunications  said in June it planned to
invest 8 billion pounds to expand the network of its Egyptian
unit over the next three years. Egypt’s mobile-phone market will
grow to 74.9 million subscribers by year-end, according to a
research report published by AlembicHC Dec. 14. Etisalat Egypt
is the country’s third-largest mobile-network operator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
