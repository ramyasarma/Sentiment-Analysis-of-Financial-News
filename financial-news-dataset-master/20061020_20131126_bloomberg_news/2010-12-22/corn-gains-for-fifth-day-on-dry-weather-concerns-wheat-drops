Corn rose to a six-week high in
Chicago trading on concern that dry weather in South America may
hurt crops. Wheat declined.  “The weather remains dry in Argentina in the most
important grain-growing regions,”  Dennis Gartman , an economist
and author of the Gartman Letter, wrote in a report today. It
also “remains dry, or drier than the grain bears would like it
to remain, in the important grain-producing regions of Brazil,”
he said.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 4.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.065 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price earlier rose to $6.07 a
bushel, the highest since Nov. 9. Prices have climbed 46 percent
this year.  Dry weather, which has already hurt crops, will return to
Argentina from Dec. 25 and persist through next week, according
to a report from AccuWeather.com. Argentina is the world’s
second-biggest shipper of corn and third-largest exporter of
soybeans, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  March-delivery soybeans were little changed at $13.38 a
bushel in Chicago after rising earlier today to $13.4025, the
highest since Nov. 12. Prices advanced 28 percent this year.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell for a second day,
declining 3.75 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $7.6125 a bushel in
Chicago. Prices have advanced 41 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
