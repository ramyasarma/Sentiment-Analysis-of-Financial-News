London Underground  workers will hold
a 24-hour strike the day after Christmas following the collapse
of talks aimed at resolving a dispute over pay and working
conditions, Transport for London said today.  Representatives for the union  Aslef  walked out of talks
today with London Underground and ACAS, the U.K.’s state-funded
mediator, TfL said in an e-mailed statement.  “Nothing changed at this morning’s meeting and therefore
the strike will go ahead,” Aslef General Secretary Keith Norman
said in a statement on the union’s website.  Aslef, which represents Britain’s train drivers including
2,500 on the subwayt, are demanding workers get three times a
normal day’s wage for working on Boxing Day, the Dec. 26
national holiday, and a day off in lieu. The union said it is
“nonsense” that London Underground should consider Boxing Day
an ordinary working day.  London Underground is refusing to increase pay because of a
“pay and conditions agreement” it reached earlier with unions.
An offer to reduce the number of drivers scheduled to work on
Boxing Day was rejected by Aslef, TfL said in the statement.  “This strike threat is beyond belief,” London Underground
Managing Director Mike Brown said in the statement. “It is
obviously not the season of goodwill for the leadership of
Aslef.”  Aslef members working for London Underground voted by a
majority of nine to one to support the strike and the union
expects the disruption to be “extensive and significant,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
