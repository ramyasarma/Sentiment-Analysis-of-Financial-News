The  International Association of
Insurance Supervisors , which is helping the  Financial Stability
Board  set up a list of insurers considered too big to fail,
said reinsurers aid financial stability and don’t create
systemic risks.  “Far from creating system concerns to financial markets,
reinsurers have contributed positively to financial stability,”
the Basel-based IAIS said today in an e-mailed  statement .
Reinsurers tend to focus on diversified risk-taking, it said.  The Basel-based IAIS  said on Nov. 2  that it’s helping the
FSB compile a list of systemically important banks and insurers
that will face tougher capital requirements. While the FSB is
seeking to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis,
insurers say it would be a mistake to classify them in the same
way as banks.  The global reinsurance market remained robust during the
financial crisis because of good risk-management practices,
according to the association’s  Global Reinsurance Market
Report 2010 .  To contact the reporter on this story:
