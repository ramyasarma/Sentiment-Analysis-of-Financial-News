Ex-UBS AG investment banker Nicos
Stephanou, formerly an associate director of mergers and
acquisitions at the Zurich-based company, will serve no more
time after testifying for prosecutors at an insider-trading
trial, a judge ruled.  Stephanou, sentenced today in federal court in New York,
was the government’s star witness in the trial of Joseph
Contorinis, a former money manager at Jefferies Paragon Fund
convicted in October in an insider-trading scheme that
prosecutors said netted more than $7 million in illegal profits.
Stephanou spent 19 months in custody after his arrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
