Steelmakers led gains in  Russian
dollar corporate bonds  for a second straight year as OAO
Severstal and Evraz Group SA profited from an increase in prices
for the metal and demand for building projects.  Debt sold by Russia’s two biggest steelmakers returned more
than 20 percent this year, compared with 10 percent for
benchmark sovereign bonds, Bloomberg data show. The yield
difference between Severstal’s 2013 notes and government debt
tumbled to 12 basis points on Dec. 16, the narrowest spread
since they were sold in 2008.  “The steelmakers were most badly hit during the crisis and
had the highest spreads so with market growth and industry
recovery they performed better,”  Nikita Gusakov , head of debt
capital markets at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow, said by e-mail.  Export prices for hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel
product, advanced 13 percent to $619 per ton this year,
according to Metal Bulletin. Orders in Russia will increase
because of projects related to the Winter Olympics and soccer
World Cup, both being staged in the country in coming years,
said  Giacomo Baizini , finance chief at Evraz in Moscow.  “We have greatly improved our liquidity situation,”
Baizini said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Business
outlook for 2011 and beyond is also good, given the expected
demand from various construction projects in Russia.”  Change of Fortune  The 2018 dollar bonds of Evraz returned 22 percent this
year, while Severstal’s 2013 bonds returned 20 percent,
Bloomberg data show. Returns on both exceeded 100 percent in
2009. The notes tumbled 43 percent in 2008, the pricing shows.  “This rally may have exhausted and the steelmakers are
likely to perform in line with the market next year,” Gusakov
said. “Spreads may tighten only if the whole market reprices.”  Russian metals companies spent $18.2 billion on foreign
acquisitions between 2006 and 2008, according to data compiled
by Moody’s Investors Service. That left them struggling to repay
and refinance their debt during the financial crisis after a
slump in earnings following a collapse of metal prices.  Evraz, Russia’s second-biggest steelmaker, was forced to
renegotiate loan terms with international lenders and turned to
the Russian state-owned development bank VEB and the domestic
ruble market for refinancing last year.  The Moscow-based company has since cut the share of short-
term debt to 22 percent in June this year from 46 percent of the
total in June 2009, while its cost of capital fell to 6 percent
from about 10 percent in October 2009, according to a Nov. 23
 presentation  posted on the company’s website.  ‘Top Picks’  A “significant improvement in credit metrics” allowed
metals companies to outperform the debt market,  Dmitry Dudkin , a
fixed-income analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, said
in an e-mailed response to questions. “They remain our top
picks as we foresee further deleveraging.”  The ruble was little changed at 30.6100 per dollar by the 5
p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest level since Nov. 11. Non-
deliverable forwards, or NDFs, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and interest rate
differentials and allow companies to hedge against fluctuations,
show the ruble at 30.8795 per dollar in three months.  Russia’s dollar bonds due in 2020 rose, pushing the yield
13 basis points lower to 5.01 percent. The price of the
country’s ruble notes due August 2016 rose, with the yield
falling 1 basis points to 7.62 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell 2 basis points to
147, down from this year’s peak of 217, according to data
provider CMA. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Swaps, Spreads  Credit-default swaps for Russia, rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, its third-lowest investment grade, cost 6
basis points more than contracts for Turkey, which is rated four
levels lower at Ba2. Russia swaps  cost  as much as 40 basis
points less on April 20.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt
rather than U.S. Treasuries fell 4 basis points to 196,
according to JPMorgan EMBI+ indexes. The difference compares
with 141 for debt of similarly rated Mexico and 179 for Brazil,
which is rated two steps lower at Baa3 by Moody’s.  The  yield  spread on Russian bonds is 43 basis points below
the average for emerging markets, near the narrowest since
September 2009 and down from a 15-month high of 105 in February,
according to JPMorgan Indexes.  2008 Collapse  The yield difference between Severstal dollar bonds due
2014 and Russia’s dollar bonds with 2030 maturity surged to 27
percentage points in November 2008, the widest spread since the
securities were sold in 2004. The spread between pipemaker OAO
TMK’s 2011 notes and Russia’s foreign debt jumped to record 54
percentage points the same month, the data show.  Russia’s winning bid to host soccer’s 2018 World Cup last
month has also helped drive the biggest bond rally in five
months and pushed steelmakers’ shares higher as the government
prepares to spend $3.8 billion on stadiums, airports and roads.  Cherepovets-based Severstal doubled in Moscow this year,
making it the biggest gainer in the  benchmark Micex index  in
2010. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest maker of the
metal, added 60 percent and OAO Novolipetsk Steel jumped 50
percent. That compares with a 6.7 percent advance for gas export
monopoly OAO Gazprom and a 13 percent decline for OAO Rosneft,
the country’s biggest oil company.  Severstal’s 20 percent bond rally this year compares to the
16 percent return for 2011 dollar bonds of Moscow-based consumer
lender ZAO Russian Standard Bank. Both companies are rated B+ by
Fitch Ratings, four levels below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
