China’s capital registered an
unprecedented 30,000 new vehicles last week, taking the total
number of automobiles on the city’s roads to a record 4.76
million, the semi-official china.com.cn website reported, citing
data from the  Beijing  traffic control center.  The municipal government plans to hold a press conference
tomorrow on its proposals to curb traffic congestion which may
including policies that limit car use or purchases.  The city, ranked as having the world’s worst traffic in a
survey by International Business Machine Corp., has proposed
offering public bicycles, building tunnels and possibly imposing
fees for driving in parts of the Chinese capital to ease
congested roads.  Other options to reduce traffic posted on the government’s
website include limits on the number of government cars in the
city and the construction of additional subway lines. The plans
have been published to allow local residents to submit comments.  A global poll of 8,192 motorists conducted by IBM this
April and May, ranked Beijing as the most “onerous” commute in
the world, when factors such as traffic predictability, gasoline
prices and emotional stress were included. Beijing also tied
with Moscow as the city with the most road trips canceled due to
anticipated traffic jams.  To alleviate congestion, the government already bars cars
from roads on specific days each week depending on the last
digit of the license plate.  -- Feiwen Rong . Editor: Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
