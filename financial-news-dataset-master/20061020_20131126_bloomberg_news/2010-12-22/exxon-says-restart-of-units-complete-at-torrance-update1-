Exxon Mobil Corp.  restarted units
and returned to normal operations at its Torrance refinery in
California, according to  Aarti Ramachandran , a company
spokeswoman.  Production was affected at the 155,800-barrel-a-day
refinery after the unplanned shutdown of two units late Dec. 20,
Ramachandran said yesterday. She declined to say which units
were shut down.  Unplanned and planned refinery outages can increase prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets to help
them meet supply contracts. Operational disruptions can also
depress prices for crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
San Francisco and in Los Angeles narrowed 2 cents to 3 cents a
gallon versus January-delivery futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as of 4:09 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The refinery’s capacity is 155,800 barrels of crude oil a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
