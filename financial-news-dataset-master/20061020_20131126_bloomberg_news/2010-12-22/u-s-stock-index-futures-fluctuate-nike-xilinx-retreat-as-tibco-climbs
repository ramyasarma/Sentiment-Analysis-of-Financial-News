U.S. stocks gained, sending the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  higher for a fifth day, as
government data showed the economy grew last quarter at a faster
pace than previously estimated.  Bank of America Corp.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose at
least 2.8 percent after lawmakers denied budget increases that
regulators said were needed to meet responsibilities imposed by
the Dodd-Frank Act.  Walgreen Co.  jumped 5.5 percent after the
largest U.S. drugstore chain reported profit that beat analyst
estimates.  Carnival Corp.  jumped 3.1 percent as S&P equity
analysts advised buying the stock.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent to 1,258.84 at 4 p.m. in New
York, the highest since Sept. 8, 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average added 26.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,559.49. The
VIX, as the  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index  is
known, fell 6.3 percent to 15.45, the lowest closing level since
July 2007. The index measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the S&P 500.  “I’m bullish on stocks regardless of what GDP revisions
look like,” said  Dan Veru , co-chief investment officer at
Palisade Capital Management LLC in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which
oversees $3.5 billion. “The economic picture is getting better,
corporate earnings are stronger. I don’t think anybody should
say that the market is overvalued or undervalued.”  The  S&P 500  yesterday completed its recovery from the six-
month plunge that followed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
collapse in September 2008, extending its rally from a bear-
market low in March 2009 to 85 percent. The index will end 2011
at 1,374, according to the average forecast of 11 strategists at
Wall Street’s biggest banks.  GDP Data  The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in
the third quarter, marking a pickup in growth that may extend
into 2011 as companies and consumers gain confidence to spend.
The revised increase in gross domestic product compares with a
2.5 percent estimate issued last month and was less than the
median forecast of a 2.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Federal Reserve’s preferred price gauge, which strips
out food and energy costs, rose at a 0.5 percent annual pace,
the slowest since record-keeping began in 1959, today’s report
showed. Inventories rose more than initially reported, while the
rise in household purchases was revised down.  ‘Right Track’  “The economy is on the right track, but people need to
understand that it’s happening at a moderate pace,” said
 Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at Raymond James &
Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida, who helps manage $240
billion. “I’m constructive going into 2011. However, with
sentiment being so bullish for stocks, you have the potential
for a pullback or air pocket over the next month.”  Another report showed  sales  of existing homes rose less
than forecast in November as the industry that triggered the
worst U.S. recession in seven decades struggled to recover after
a government tax credit lapsed. Purchases increased 5.6 percent
to a 4.68 million annual rate, the National Association of
Realtors said in Washington. Economists projected sales would
rise to a 4.75 million pace, according to the  median forecast  in
a Bloomberg News survey.  Banks had the biggest gain in the S&P 500 among 24
industries, rallying 1.7 percent. U.S. financial regulators,
struggling for months with budgets unequipped to handle new
responsibilities imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, will be forced
to go another 10 weeks without a funding increase. Without that
funding, new initiatives will be postponed or scrapped,
regulators have said.  Bank of America  advanced 3.1 percent to $13.38. JPMorgan
climbed 2.8 percent to $42.16.  Walgreen   Walgreen  gained 5.5 percent to $38.85. The largest U.S.
drug-store chain had fiscal first-quarter profit of 62 cents a
share. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated profit of 54
cents on average.  Carnival  gained 3.1 percent to $46.59, the highest price
since November 2007. The world’s biggest cruise-line operator
was raised to “buy” from “hold” at S&P.  Nike Inc.  sank 5.8 percent to $86.95. The world’s largest
maker of athletic shoes said orders for December to April rose
11 percent for a total of $7.7 billion, excluding currency
fluctuations, from a year ago. That missed the 11.6 percent gain
projected by the average of five analysts’ estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Red Hat  Red Hat Inc.  dropped 2.5 percent to $46.70. The largest
seller of the Linux operating system had third-quarter profit of
20 cents a share, matching the average analyst forecast.  Optimism about U.S.  stocks  among newsletter writers rose to
the highest level since the middle of October 2007. The
proportion of bullish publications among about 130 tracked by
Investors Intelligence jumped to 58.8 percent yesterday from
56.8 percent a week earlier. Sentiment has improved since
October 2008, when the financial crisis drove the figure to a
20-year low of 22.2 percent.  “Tonight I’m gonna party like its Oct. 2007,”  Peter Boockvar , an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New
York, wrote in an e-mail to clients today. “The bulls can be
right for a period of time so this is not an indicator to go out
and sell everything but it does highlight that the likely risk
reward in the short term is getting more iffy.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
