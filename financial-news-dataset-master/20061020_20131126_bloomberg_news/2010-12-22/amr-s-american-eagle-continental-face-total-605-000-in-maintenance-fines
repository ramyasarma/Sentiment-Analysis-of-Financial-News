AMR Corp. ’s American Eagle regional
carrier and  Continental Airlines  face a combined $605,000 in
possible fines for maintenance flaws, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.  Eagle, based in Fort Worth, Texas, may be penalized
$330,000 after inspectors found that it had flown two planes
with seats that would not stow into the upright and locked
position, according to an agency statement today.  Continental, part of Chicago-based  United Continental
Holdings Inc. , faces a $275,000 fine after operating two  Boeing
Co . 737-900ER planes on 73 flights with incorrect landing gear
wheel-tire assemblies installed, according to the FAA. Both
carriers have 30 days to respond to the proposed fines.  “We disagree” with the proposed FAA penalty,  Tim Smith ,
an AMR spokesman, said in an e-mail. “The amount proposed is
excessive.” Eagle executives will meet with the FAA to discuss
the case, he said.  Continental is “reviewing the FAA’s concerns,”  Mary Clark , a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  President  Barack Obama ’s FAA has been increasing fines on
the aviation industry compared with the last year of President
 George W. Bush ’s term, federal data shows. The FAA proposed
$77.4 million in fines in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Obama’s
first full fiscal year in office. That’s up 66 percent from
$46.7 million Bush proposed for the year ended Sept. 30, 2008.  Democrats complained of inaction under Bush. House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman  James Oberstar  of Minnesota faulted the FAA in 2008 for “a carrier-
favorable, cozy relationship” after his panel found Dallas-
based  Southwest Airlines Co . missed certain inspections of
 Boeing  737s.  The FAA proposed a record $24.2 million fine against
American in August for alleged maintenance flaws that grounded a
fleet of Boeing Co. MD-80s in 2008. American is appealing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
