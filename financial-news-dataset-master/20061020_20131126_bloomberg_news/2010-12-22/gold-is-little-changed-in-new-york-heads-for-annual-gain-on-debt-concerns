Gold futures were little changed
after advancing 27 percent this year on demand for a haven from
escalating European debt.  Investment in 10 leading exchange-traded  funds  backed by
gold has climbed 18 percent this year. Futures reached an all-
time high of $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7 and are headed for a
10th straight annual gain. The International Monetary Fund said
yesterday it concluded the planned sale of 403.3 metric tons, or
13 percent of its gold reserves.  “The gold market is expected to trade higher today,”  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said
in a report. “Support will come from the completion of the
IMF’s gold sales, a bullish year-end seasonal pattern and
ongoing worries over European sovereign debt.”  Gold futures for February fell 80 cents to $1,388 at 9:45
a.m. on the Comex in New York. The price climbed 1.3 percent in
the past three sessions.  Investors may interpret the IMF sale “to be an indication
of reduced supplies from the official sector,” Pawlicki said.  Gold priced in euros reached a record on Dec. 7. The cost
of insuring Greek debt jumped to a four-week high after Fitch
Ratings warned it may cut the nation’s credit rating to junk.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 3.9 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $29.355 an ounce. Before today, the metal jumped 75
percent this year.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $4.30, or 0.6
percent, to $757.35 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  Platinum futures for April delivery climbed $3.90, or 0.2
percent, to $1,731 an ounce.  Before today, palladium surged 84 percent this year, and
platinum was up 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
