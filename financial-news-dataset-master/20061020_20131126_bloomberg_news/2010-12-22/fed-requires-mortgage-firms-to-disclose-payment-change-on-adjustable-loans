The Federal Reserve approved rules
under the Truth in Lending Act requiring lenders to disclose how
interest payments may change for adjustable-rate home loans.  Mortgage firms must disclose details of the first rate
adjustment for so-called “5-1 ARM” loans, the  central bank 
said today in a statement. The disclosure must reflect the
earliest date for a change in interest-only loans, the Fed said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
