Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
biggest carmaker, introduced an updated Vitz compact in Japan to
stem a decline in domestic auto demand.  Toyota aims to sell 10,000 units a month of the model in
its home market, the company said in a statement today. The Vitz
will be priced from 1.06 million yen ($12,653), Toyota said.  Japan’s domestic new vehicle sales will probably fall 9.9
percent next year to 4.47 million units, after a government
subsidy program for fuel-efficient models ended in September,
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Group said Dec. 17. Sales may
start to recover from around next September, the auto group’s
Chairman  Toshiyuki Shiga  said today.  Toyota said yesterday that it expects its Japan sales will
fall 17 percent to 1.3 million units in 2011, excluding its
Daihatsu Motor Co. and Hino Motors Ltd. units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
