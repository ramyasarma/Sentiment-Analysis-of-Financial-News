Australians want another election in
the wake of the “precarious” minority government formed after
the Aug. 21 ballot by Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who they’re
still unhappy with because of the way predecessor Kevin Rudd was
replaced, the Daily Telegraph newspaper said.  A “surprising amount of voters” have concerns about the
stability of the government, the newspaper said, citing an Ipso
Mackay Mind and Mood report based on group discussions
throughout Australia.  While worried about rising energy costs and scarcity of
water, Australians felt more confident about the economy and
job security, the newspaper reported, without saying how many
people were surveyed.  Many voters are “deeply uncomfortable” with how Gillard
became prime minister, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
