Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki  accepted
the resignation of  Bethuel Kiplagat , chairman of Kenya’s truth
commission, who is under investigation for human rights abuses,
the  Daily Nation  said, citing an unidentified official.  Kiplagat presented a letter of resignation to President
Mwai Kibaki yesterday, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported
today.  A panel has been appointed to examine allegations that
Kiplagat was involved in human rights violations in the East
African nation dating back decades, the Daily Nation said.
Kiplagat has denied the accusations.  Kiplagat didn’t answer his mobile phone when Bloomberg News
called seeking comment today. Kathleen Openda, spokeswoman for
the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, based in the
