Boeing Co.  said world air-cargo
traffic will regain its 2007 peak this year and increase at a
5.9 percent annual rate during the next 20 years, a faster pace
than it predicted last year.  The outlook is part of Boeing’s World Air-Cargo Forecast
2010/2011 and is an advance over the average 5.4 percent annual
growth the Chicago-based predicted in September 2009.  “We’re working from a lower base as a result of the
economic downturn in 2008, 2009,” said  Bob Saling , a spokesman
for Boeing. The rise in air-cargo traffic in 2010 pushed the
overall forecast up, he said.  Boeing said an air-cargo traffic recovery fueled by Asian
industrial activity started in November 2009 and continued for
the first eight months of 2010. The period from 2008 to 2009 was
the first time traffic contracted for two consecutive years,
Boeing said in a statement.  “Industrial requirements are driving the rebound, as air
cargo is an essential tool for industry and commerce to manage
supply chains and bring goods to market,” said Jerry Allyne,
vice president of strategic planning and analysis for Boeing
Commercial Airplanes. “As airlines return to profitability,
they will begin to consider fleet renewal to improve long-term
operating costs.”  The world freighter fleet will increase by 1,212 airplanes
to 2,967 during the 20-year period, with 70 percent of that
demand being met by conversions of passenger and passenger-
freighter airplanes. Large freighters like the Boeing 747 and
777 will eventually be a third of the fleet, up from 27 percent
today, according to the statement.  Boeing  declined 70 cents, or 1 percent, to $69.78 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 29 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
