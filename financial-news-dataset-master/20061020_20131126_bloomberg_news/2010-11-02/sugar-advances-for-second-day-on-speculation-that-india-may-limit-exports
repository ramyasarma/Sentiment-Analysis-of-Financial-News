Raw sugar surged to a 29-year high as
dry weather crimps output in Brazil, the world’s biggest
producer, and India may cap exports to boost domestic supplies.  Output  in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s biggest
producing-region, tumbled 30 percent in the first half of
October from a year earlier, industry association Unica said on
Oct. 28. Stockpiles in India, the second-largest grower, are
about 4 million metric tons, compared with the nation’s
preferred level of 10 million tons, according to Rabobank
International.  “Both Brazil and India are contributing to this frenzy,”
said  Judith Ganes-Chase , the president of J. Ganes Consulting
LLC in Katonah, New York. “The prices will remain strong.”  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.67 cent, or 2.3
percent, to settle at 30.12 cents at 2:09 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 30.64 cents, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Jan. 15, 1981.  The commodity may climb to 35 cents by March should dry
weather in Brazil persist amid increased demand from countries
including China, said  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president
at Newedge USA. That would mark the highest level since November
1980.  Sugar has more than doubled since touching a 13-month low
on May 7 on concern that adverse weather will reduce output in
Brazil, Russia, China and Pakistan. The market needs supplies
from India to meet a deficit, McDougall said.  ‘Big Question’  “India is the big question overhanging the market,” said
 Jake Wetherall , a London-based trader at Rabobank International.
“It looks like India is going to have a fairly good crop this
year. It should be over 25 million tons for the first time in a
few years. But the question is how much the government decides
is going to be made available for export.”  Societe Generale SA  raised price forecasts for raw and
refined sugar, citing lower crop forecasts. Raw sugar in the
fourth quarter will be 29.2 cents, up from a Sept. 17 estimate
of 17 cents,  Emmanuel Jayet , an analyst in Paris, said in a
report. The estimate for white sugar was raised to $744 a ton
from $515.  Refined-sugar futures for March delivery gained $12, or 1.6
percent, to $747 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. Earlier, the
price reached $755.90, the highest level since Jan. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
