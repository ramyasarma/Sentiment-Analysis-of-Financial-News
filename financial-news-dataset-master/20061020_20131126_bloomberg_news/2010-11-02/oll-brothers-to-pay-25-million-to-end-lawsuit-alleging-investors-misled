Toll Brothers Inc. , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, agreed to pay $25 million to settle a
lawsuit that alleged the company misled investors about its
ability to weather the slump in the housing market.  The City of Hialeah Employees’ Retirement System in Florida
sued in April 2007, claiming directors misrepresented demand for
Toll’s new homes in fiscal year 2005 and growth projections for
2006. The Laborers Pension Trust Fund for Northern California
joined as co-plaintiff seeking to represent investors who bought
 shares  from Dec. 9, 2004, to Nov. 8, 2005. Toll denies any
wrongdoing.  Toll and its board “wish to eliminate the uncertainty,
risk, burden and expense of further litigation, and to permit
the operation of the company’s business without further
distraction,” according to settlement papers filed Oct. 28 in
U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.  Toll in August reported its first  quarterly profit  since
2007. The homebuilder, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, recorded
a $26.5 million third-quarter gain from a tax benefit, ending a
streak of 11 straight quarterly losses.  Martin Connor , Toll’s chief financial officer, declined to
comment on the settlement. In a Sept. 8  regulatory filing , Toll
said the agreement was reached in July and will be funded
entirely by the company’s insurers.  Under the agreement, which requires a judge’s approval,
plaintiffs’ lawyers will receive fees totaling about 25 percent
of the settlement amount, or $6.25 million, plus expenses of as
much as $750,000, according to court papers.  Toll  rose 67 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $18.52 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
fallen 1.5 percent this year.  The case is City of Hialeah Employees’ Retirement System v.
Toll Brothers Inc, 07-cv-1513, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporters on this story:
