Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
listed the London Stock Exchange’s first structured notes linked
to the London interbank offered rate and aimed at individual
investors.  The 12-year notes pay a coupon equal to the three-month
sterling Libor rate, and have a 3.9 percent floor, according to
the term sheet. The securities are listed on the LSE’s order
book for retail bonds, known as Orb, and can be traded in
denominations of 100 pounds ($160).  “This is more of a niche product for investors,” said  Ben Board , a director of structured product sales at RBS in London.
“We are using the Libor rate as a proxy for base rates.”  The Bank of England’s base rate is predicted to rise to 1
percent by the fourth quarter of 2011, according to the average
forecast of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank
has kept the rate at a record low 0.5 percent since March 2009.  Three-month  Libor , an average of rates set daily by banks
and used as a borrowing benchmark, is 0.74 percent. The rate was
as high as 6.9 percent in September 2007 when defaults on U.S.
subprime mortgages pushed up credit costs around the world.  RBS is aiming to sell 20 million pounds of the notes, which
are quoted with a 1 percent spread between the bid and offer
prices.  “The bond market in the U.K. has generally been very
institutional and opaque for private investors,” said Jonathan
Blostone, an LSE spokesman. “As it’s listed on our ORB
platform, the new product makes it much easier for retail
investors to trade structured bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
