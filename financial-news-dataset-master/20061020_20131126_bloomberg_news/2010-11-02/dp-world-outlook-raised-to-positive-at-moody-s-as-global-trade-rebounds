DP World Ltd., the world’s fourth-
biggest port operator, had its outlook changed to “positive”
from “stable” at Moody’s Investors Service today. The rating
company affirmed the Ba1 rating of DP World.  “The outlook change to positive for DP World reflects
Moody’s view that the improving fundamentals for port operators
-- with increasing volumes  of global trade flows, especially in
emerging markets -- are likely to remain favorable over the
medium term,” Martin Kohlhase, Dubai-based assistant vice
president at Moody’s, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
