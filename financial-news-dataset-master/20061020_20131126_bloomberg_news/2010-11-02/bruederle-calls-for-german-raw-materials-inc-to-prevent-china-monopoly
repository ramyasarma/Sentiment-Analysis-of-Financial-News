German Economy Minister  Rainer Bruederle  called on companies in Germany to form a commodities
syndicate to focus investment on obtaining rare-earth metals and
push back on a Chinese monopoly over the materials.  Bruederle, on a trip to Canada, said the formation of a
“Raw Materials Inc.” would constitute an effort by German
industry to press back against the formation of a monopoly he
compared with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  “There’s the danger that we could get an iron-ore OPEC or
a rare-earths OPEC,” Bruederle told reporters in Ottawa,
referring to China’s dominance of the market for rare earths.  Policymakers in Europe, the U.S. and Japan have called on
China to restore rare-earth exports after the Chinese government
in July announced cuts in production of the elements used in
everything from hybrid vehicles and flat-screen TVs to weapons
systems. China produces more 90 percent of the world’s rare
earths.  Germany aims to draw rare-earth elements from two Canadian
mining projects that might supply as much as 5,000 tons of rare
earths a year from 2012 or 2013, Bruederle said. Establishing
trade partnerships will become a component to talks with
developing countries on receiving aid, he also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
