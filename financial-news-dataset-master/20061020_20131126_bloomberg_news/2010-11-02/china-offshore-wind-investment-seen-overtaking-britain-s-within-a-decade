China will likely surpass the U.K. as
the world’s largest investor in offshore wind farms in the next
decade, according to a study by Douglas Westwood Ltd., a marine
and energy industry consultant.  Within five years China, the U.K. and Germany will account
for 83 percent of global installations of wind turbines on
water, Douglas Westwood said. Manufacturers have begun making
offshore equipment in China, where development times to set up
the power plants are about half the length they are in Europe,
the report said.  “Having entered the offshore wind industry only recently,
the country has massive ambition,” said  John Westwood , chairman
of Douglas Westwood. “Whilst Europe has been the hot-spot of
activity to date, we anticipate that China will become the world
leader in offshore wind.”  Investment in wind-power installations on land as well as
on water, where they typically anchor turbines to the seabed,
may reach $202 billion and supply 22 percent of the world’s
electricity demand within two decades, the Global Wind Energy
Council said last month.  Last year, $63 billion was invested, adding 37.5 gigawatts
of capacity and bringing potential output of electricity from
wind to 157.9 gigawatts, according to the Brussels-based
industry group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
