(Corrects spelling of name in first paragraph of story
published Nov. 2.)  A woman who stabbed U.K. lawmaker
Stephen Timms earlier this year in revenge for his support of
the war in Iraq was found guilty of attempted murder today.  The jury at the Old Bailey criminal court in London also
convicted Roshonara Choudhary, 21, of two counts of possessing
an offensive weapon, a court spokesman said today.  Choudhary stabbed Timms in the stomach with a three-inch-
long kitchen knife at a community center in east London where he
was meeting constituents, prosecutor William Boyce said
yesterday. She managed to stab Timms twice before a security
guard restrained her, Boyce said.  Choudhary told police she intended to keep stabbing Timms
until someone stopped her and that she had brought a second
knife in case the first one broke, Boyce said. The attack was
recorded by security cameras.  The stab wounds lacerated Timms’ liver and punctured his
stomach-lining, according to Nigel Tai, the surgeon that treated
Timms. While the injuries weren’t “immediately life
threatening,” Timms could have died from infection without
surgery, he told the court yesterday.  Choudhary doesn’t recognize the authority of the court, has
refused to attend the trial, and told her lawyers not to
challenge any evidence according to her lawyer Jeremy Dein.  To contact the reporter on this story:
