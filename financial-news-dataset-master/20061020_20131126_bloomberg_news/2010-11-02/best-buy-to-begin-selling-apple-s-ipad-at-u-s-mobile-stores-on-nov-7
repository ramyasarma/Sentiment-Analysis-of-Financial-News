Best Buy Co.  will sell  Apple Inc.’s 
iPad in its stand-alone U.S. mobile stores starting Nov. 7 to
capitalize on the popularity of the tablet computer.  Best Buy, which began selling the iPad in its regular
stores in April, is expanding distribution of the touch-screen
device as it opens more mobile stores before the holidays.  The Richfield, Minnesota-based company plans to open 23
mobile stores before the Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 25, giving
it a total of 158, Jeff Haydock, a Best Buy spokesman, said
today in a telephone interview.  Best Buy  rose  55 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.72 at 11:58
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
had gained 6.9 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
