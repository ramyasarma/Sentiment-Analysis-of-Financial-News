Brazil has better corporate
governance and transparency than Russia, India and China, said
Will Landers, who oversees about $10 billion in Latin American
stocks at BlackRock Inc.  “The work done by CVM and Bovespa really differentiated
Brazil from the BRIC world,” Landers said, referring to the
country’s securities regulator and stock exchange. He spoke at a
Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce event in New York.  “We do have clear rules, we do have transparency, we do
have companies available” to talk to shareholders, Landers
said. These factors helped Brazil to take stock market
leadership in the region from Mexico, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
