Bankruptcy filings by U.S. consumers
totaled 132,173 last month, 1.4 percent more than in September,
keeping Americans on track to file 1.6 million bankruptcies this
year, the American Bankruptcy Institute said.  October’s total fell 2.8 percent from the same month last
year, the institute said today in a statement. The information
was based on data collected by the National Bankruptcy Research
Center.  “As the issues of unemployment and economic stress weigh
heavily on today’s elections, consumers continue to seek the
financial shelter of bankruptcy,”  Samuel J. Gerdano , the
institute’s executive director, said in the statement.  U.S. unemployment in October probably remained at 9.6
percent for a third month, according to the median of 61
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The Labor Department is
scheduled to release jobless numbers in a Nov. 5 report.  More consumers filed for bankruptcy during the first 10
months of the year than for the same period in 2009, according
to the institute. About 1.3 million consumers sought court
protection from their debts so far this year, compared with
about 1.2 million through October in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
