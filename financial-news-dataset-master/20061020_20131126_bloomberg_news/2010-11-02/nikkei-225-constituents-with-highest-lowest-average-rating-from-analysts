The following tables show the highest and
lowest average analyst ratings for stocks in the Nikkei 225 Index as of
Nov. 3.  Bloomberg assigns a number to each rating that ranges from 1 to 5,
with 5 being the highest recommendation. To calculate the average, these
numbers are added together and the total is divided by how many
recommendations were made during the past 12 months. The target price is
the average of analysts' 12 months predicted price. Only companies
that have at least three analyst ratings are included.    
@ - There is only one target price included  * - The total return calculated is less than a one-year period.  -- Bloomberg News
