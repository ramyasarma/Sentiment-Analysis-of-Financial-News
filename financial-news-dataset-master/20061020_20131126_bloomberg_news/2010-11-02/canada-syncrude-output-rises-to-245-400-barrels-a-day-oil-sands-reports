Canadian  Syncrude production  rose 6
percent to 245,400 barrels a day in October from 231,500 barrels
a day in September, Canadian Oil Sands Trust said in a notice on
its website.  October output was affected by unplanned maintenance on
upgrading units and planned work on the coker 8-1, according to
the notice. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic crude oil
derived from tar sands in Alberta.  Planned work on the coker began Sept. 9 and was originally
scheduled to last 45 days. The work was extended by as much as a
week, the company said in September. The unscheduled maintenance
occurred on a hydrotreater and other upgrading units,  Siren Fisekci , a spokeswoman for Canadian Oil Sands, said Sept. 24.  Syncrude’s mining operations and upgrading facility are
located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Fort McMurray in
Alberta. It is a joint venture among seven oil and gas
companies, of which Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. holds a 36.74
percent interest, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
