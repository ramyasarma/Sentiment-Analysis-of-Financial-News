American Superconductor Corp ., a
maker of wind turbine components and transmission lines, jumped
the most in more than five months after management raised its
forecast for the year ending March 31.  American Superconductor rose $2.39, or 7.4 percent, to
$34.89 as of 12:25 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading. The shares, which earlier reached $35.43 for the
biggest gain since May 17, have declined 15 percent this year.  Revenue for fiscal 2010 will be $430 million to $440
million, up from an earlier forecast of $420 million to $430
million, the Devens, Massachusetts-based company said today in a
statement. Net income may more than double to 95 cents to $1 a
share, the manufacturer said.  Before today, the company was expected to earn 89 cents on
sales of $430 million, the average  estimates  of 12 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
