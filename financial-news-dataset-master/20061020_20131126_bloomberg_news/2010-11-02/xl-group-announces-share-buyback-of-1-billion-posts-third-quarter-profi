XL Group Plc , the biggest gainer in
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  last year, said it may
repurchase as much as $1 billion in shares after posting a
third-quarter profit.  The Dublin, Ireland-based insurer didn’t disclose a date by
which it will complete the buyback and said the repurchases will
occur gradually, according to a statement distributed today by
PR Newswire.  Third-quarter net income attributable to ordinary
shareholders was $77.5 million, or 23 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $11.4 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier.
Operating income was 52 cents a share, missing the 60-cent
 average estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We have delivered another quarter of solid operating
results in a market that continues to be challenging,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mike McGavick  said in the statement.  XL gained 10 cents to $21.02 in regular New York Stock
Exchange trading today. It has risen about  15 percent  this year
after a 395 percent surge in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
