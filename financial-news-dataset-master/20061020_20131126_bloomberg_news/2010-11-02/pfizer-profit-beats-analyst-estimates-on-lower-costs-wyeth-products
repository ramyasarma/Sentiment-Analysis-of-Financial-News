Pfizer Inc. , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, reported third-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates after price increases and workforce reductions helped
counter declining sales of the cholesterol pill Lipitor.  Profit excluding the costs for its purchase of Wyeth last
year and other items was 54 cents a share, beating the 51 cents
average estimate of 15  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
income fell 70 percent to $866 million, or 11 cents a share, on
acquisition charges and costs for an asbestos lawsuit, the New
York-based company said today in a  statement .  Revenue rose 39 percent to $16.2 billion after adding
medicines from Wyeth, missing analyst estimates by 2.9 percent.
Lipitor sales declined 11 percent to $2.5 billion as generic
copies were introduced in Canada and Spain. Pfizer is counting
on Wyeth products to offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor
faces competition from cheaper copies in the U.S. next year.  Pfizer “has made real progress with cost synergies from
the Wyeth deal,” said  Marc Goodman , an analyst with UBS
Securities LLC, in a research note. “Although top-line numbers
missed the mark, we think investors should like the strong
efforts in cost cutting coupled with increased 2010 earnings-
per-share guidance.”  Pfizer declined 17 cents, or 1 percent, to $17.45 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have
increased 3 percent in the past 12 months.  2010 Forecast Raised  The drugmaker raised its earnings  forecast  for the year to
between $2.17 and $2.22 a share when some items are excluded,
the statement said. Pfizer said in August it expected earnings
of $2.10 a share to $2.20 a share. The company reaffirmed its
forecast for 2012.  Pfizer reported impairment charges of $1.5 billion related
to the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth and a $701 million charge
for asbestos litigation for its subsidiary Quigley Company Inc.
Quigley was denied permission to exit bankruptcy in September by
a judge who found that Pfizer manipulated the bankruptcy process
to benefit itself. The judge cited testimony that asbestos
claims directed at Quigley could total $4.45 billion over the
next 42 years.  Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug with $11.4 billion in
sales last year, faces U.S. competition from generic versions in
November 2011. Third-quarter sales of the drug missed the $2.73
billion estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue for Lipitor will drop by more than half in 2012,
according to the analysts.  Revenue Sources  Pfizer sought to add new revenue sources this month with an
agreement to buy King Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $3.6 billion to
acquire a painkiller franchise and the $200 million purchase of
rights to insulin products made by Biocon Ltd. in Bangalore,
India.  “King was a bolt-on acquisition,” said  Frank D’Amelio ,
Pfizer’s chief financial officer, in a telephone interview.
“Our focus is on a combination of relatively smaller deals and
then these couple-of-billion-dollar to several billion-dollar
deals,” D’Amelio said.  Pfizer has been slashing costs and said it’s on schedule to
fire 19,000 employees, close 8 manufacturing plants and shut 6
research centers as it absorbs the Wyeth purchase and braces for
the loss of Lipitor’s patent protection. Even before that plan
was enacted, Pfizer had fired about 40,000 employees over the
six years ended in 2009.  The Enbrel arthritis treatment generated $799 million.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated $802.5 million. The
pain pill Lyrica generated $757 million, an increase of 7
percent. The pneumonia vaccines Prevnar and Prevnar13 had
combined sales of $735 million.  Pfizer bought back $500 million in shares as part of a
previously announced $5 billion repurchase program. Revenue for
the quarter was reduced one percent by foreign exchange costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
