 China’s stocks will be “range-
bound” this month, as some investors are likely to sell shares
amid the rally, according to Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co.  The Shanghai Composite Index will trade between 2,900 and
3,150 in November, analysts led by Yuan Yi at the Shanghai-based
brokerage wrote in a report today. The brokerage recommends
shares of companies that have “stable” growth and are in
“emerging” industries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
