PAI Partners Holdings Inc., a
Paris-based private-equity firm, is seeking about 500 million
euros ($700 million) of debt to fund its buyout of Swissport
International AG, according to a person familiar with the deal.  The debt may include a combination of loans and bonds, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the
transaction is private. A PAI Partners spokesperson, who didn’t
want to be identified citing company policy, declined to
comment.  PAI Partners agreed to buy the airport ground-services
business from  Ferrovial SA  for 900 million Swiss francs ($909
million) in a deal valuing Swissport at 1.2 billion Swiss
francs, Ferrovial said in a  statement  on its website today. The
Madrid-based builder said it expects the transaction to close by
January pending regulatory approval and acquisition financing.  Leveraged buyouts in Europe have been financed with $16.9
billion of loans this year, compared with $5.4 billion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt is
raised in the name of target companies and repaid with their
cash flow, triggering a fall in the companies’ credit rating to
junk, or below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by
Standard & Poor’s.  PAI Partners manages a 2.7-billion euro leveraged buyout
fund.  To contact the reporters on this story:
