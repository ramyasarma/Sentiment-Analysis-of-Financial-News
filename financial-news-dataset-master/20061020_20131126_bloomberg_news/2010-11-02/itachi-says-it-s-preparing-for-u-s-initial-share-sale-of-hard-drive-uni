Hitachi Ltd. , the Japanese industrial
group with more than 900 units covering nuclear reactors to
financial services, said it’s preparing for a U.S. initial
public offering of its hard-disk-drive unit.  Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, the wholly owned unit,
will probably list on the New York Stock Exchange or National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, Tokyo-
based Hitachi said in a statement today.  Hitachi is forecasting its first annual  profit  in five
years as it eliminates money-losing units and focuses on
profitable operations including industrial machinery and
infrastructure such as power plants.  The hard-disk-drive unit generated revenue of $4.8 billion
in the year ended March 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
