The Serbian government is relying on
inflation to boost the value of budget revenue, risking damage
to the economy and the dinar to meet immediate spending needs,
 Politika  reported, citing  Bosko Zivkovic , the president of the
central bank’s Council of the Governor.  That practice means that the central bank may be unable to
“neutralize” all the “bad effects” of the government’s
fiscal policies, even it “uses all the measures at its
disposal,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.  Zivkovic urged the government to curb spending instead of
tolerating nearly double-digit inflation to get a nominal
increase in revenue, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
