The automobile industry, in a case
involving  Mazda Motor Corp. , is seeking the  U.S. Supreme Court ’s
help in limiting lawsuits that accuse carmakers of failing to
install the best safety equipment.  Toyota Motor Corp. , facing more than 300 lawsuits over
alleged unintended acceleration, could have a big stake in the
outcome of the dispute. The high court will hear arguments
tomorrow.  “This case raises issues of enormous importance to auto
manufacturers,” said  Charles Territo , a spokesman for the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The fear, he said, is that
federal regulations will be “superseded” by a patchwork of
state laws on personal injury claims.  The Supreme Court might deadlock 4-4 because  Elena Kagan ,
the newest justice, has disqualified herself. As the Obama
administration’s solicitor general earlier this year, she urged
the court to take the case. A tie vote would leave intact a
lower court ruling that favored automakers without setting a
national precedent.  The auto industry and its allies are asking the court to
reinforce a 2000 decision that said federal law shields
automakers from state law claims over how quickly manufacturers
installed air bags, now required in vehicles sold in the U.S.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, food producers and makers of
children’s products have weighed in on Mazda’s side.  Seat Belt Claim  The Transportation Department’s National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration has 59 safety standards that govern
automotive components, including windshield wipers, internal
trunk releases and seat belts. The standards set performance
guidelines that manufacturers must follow.  Mazda, based in Hiroshima, Japan, was sued by the family of
Thanh Williamson, 32, who died in 2002 in Utah as she was riding
in a rear aisle seat in the second row of a 1993 MPV minivan.  When the minivan was manufactured, seat belts that buckled
only over the lap -- without a shoulder harness -- were
permitted by law for some back seat passengers. The current
regulations took effect in 2007 and require new cars to have
shoulder restraints in all forward-facing seats, including rear
aisle seats.  The Williamson van struck a Jeep Wrangler that had become
detached from a motor home that was towing it. The collision
forced Williamson’s body to jackknife around her seatbelt,
causing severe abdominal injuries and internal bleeding,
according to the lawsuit filed by her husband.  A California state appeals court barred the suit from going
forward, ruling it was preempted by federal law. Mazda’s U.S.
headquarters is in Irvine, California.  U.S. Approved  Maureen Mahoney , a Washington-based appellate lawyer at
Latham & Watkins LLP who represents Mazda, said it would be
unwise to subject carmakers to state law claims over seatbelts
that federal regulators have approved.  Auto manufacturers could “face crushing liability in 50
states from 50 different systems,” she told a Chamber of
Commerce gathering last month.  Bailey Wood, a spokesman for the National Automobile
Dealers Association in McLean, Virginia, said in an interview
that exposing the industry to such lawsuits could mean
“millions or possibly billions from liability claims” that
would be passed along to car buyers.  Allison Zieve , a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation
Group in Washington and one of the attorneys representing the
Williamson family, said the auto industry is exaggerating.  “The manufacturers will still have a full opportunity to
defend the case on the merits or present any other defense they
might have, just like they did for years and years,” she said
in an interview.  The Supreme Court last year, ruling on preemption in a
different context, said consumers can sue drugmakers for failing
to provide adequate safety warnings. The 6-3 ruling said
pharmaceutical companies aren’t shielded from suit by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a treatment and its
packaging information.  The case is Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, 08-1314.  To contact the reporters on this story:
