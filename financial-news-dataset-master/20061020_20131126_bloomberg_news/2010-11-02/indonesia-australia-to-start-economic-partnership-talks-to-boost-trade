Australia and Indonesia will start
negotiations on an economic partnership as the two Asia-Pacific
neighbors seek to bolster trade ties.  The countries will hold talks to build a Comprehensive
Economic Partnership Agreement covering business cooperation,
trade and investment, the office of Australia’s prime minister
said in a statement.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  and Indonesian President
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  made the announcement after meeting in
Jakarta today. Gillard, on a regional tour, said yesterday that
she expects to conclude negotiations on a free-trade accord with
Malaysia next year.  Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is Australia’s
13th-largest  trading partner . About 400 Australian companies
operate in the country focused on mining, construction, banking,
transportation and the food and beverage industry.  Yudhoyono also said his government is "open" to a proposal
by Australia to build a processing center for asylum seekers to
prevent people smuggling and human trafficking across the
region. Gillard wants to build an offshore center and has held
talks with East Timor, formerly part of Indonesia, about setting
up a detention facility.  To contact the reporters on this story:
