Magyar Telekom Nyrt., Hungary’s
former phone monopoly controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG, said
the Budapest Metropolitan Court rejected a suit brought by
minority shareholders to annul the decisions of the company’s
2010 shareholders’ meeting.  The ruling was in the first instance and can be appealed,
Magyar Telekom said in an e-mail today.  In a separate case, Magyar Telekom said the Metropolitan
Court ruled in favor of two minority shareholders who wanted the
company held liable for the termination of agreeements for the
operation of call centers. Magyar Telekom said it will appeal
this decision.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
