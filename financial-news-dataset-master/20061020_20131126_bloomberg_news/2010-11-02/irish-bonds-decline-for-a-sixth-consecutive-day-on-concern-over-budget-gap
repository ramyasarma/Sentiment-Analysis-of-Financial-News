Irish bonds fell, driving the extra
yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of German
debt to a record, on mounting concern the nation will struggle
to reduce its budget deficit.  Irish 10-year bonds declined for a sixth consecutive day as
Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  tries to put together a 2011
budget by Dec. 7 that convinces investors he can get the
country’s finances in order. The  yield spread  against bunds, the
euro region’s benchmark securities, widened 22 basis points to
484 basis points, the most since Bloomberg began collecting the
data in 1991. German 10-year bunds rose for a third day.  “Peripherals are being driven lower on concern over budget
deficits, and sentiment is very fragile,” said  Michael Leister ,
a fixed-income analyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, Germany.
“Investors and market participants are looking for ways out of
Ireland, Portugal as well as Greece. This selloff in peripherals
may continue.”  The Irish 10-year bond yield climbed 21 basis points to
7.45 percent as of 4:24 p.m. in London. The 5 percent security
due October 2020 fell 1.29, or 12.9 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,403) face amount, to 83.21.  The yield on the German 10-year bund fell one basis point
to 2.47 percent.  “There’s decent support for bunds in terms of safe-haven
flows,” Leister said.  Cost May Jump  Investors have dumped Irish bonds in the past three months
after the government was forced to pump more money into its
banking system. The administration said Sept. 30 that the cost
of rescuing the country’s lenders may jump to as much as 50
billion euros, or almost one third of the nation’s gross
domestic product. Four weeks later, it said it needs 15 billion
euros of savings by 2014 to hit its budget target.  Irish bonds extended their declines even after the European
Central Bank bought some of the securities, according to three
traders with knowledge of the transactions.  The ECB purchased debt maturing in 2019 and 2025, one of
the traders said on condition of anonymity because the deals are
confidential. A central bank spokesman declined to comment when
contacted by telephone in Frankfurt.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said that investors will
have to pay for any future euro-region debt crisis, offering no
respite to peripheral countries as bond yields soared.  Debt Crisis  Measures being drafted by the European Union will result in
rules with “more bite” to protect the euro, Merkel said in a
speech today in Bruges, Belgium. Along with steps to prevent EU
members running up excessive debt, a crisis mechanism enshrined
in EU treaties is necessary for the longer term, she said.  Greek bonds fell for a seventh day, their longest losing
streak since April. The Greek 10-year bond yield gained 10 basis
points to 10.9 percent, after climbing as high as 11.1 percent,
the highest level since Sept. 23, based on closing prices. The
Greek-German spread rose 11 basis points to 833 basis points. It
reached 844 basis points earlier today, the most since Sept. 28.  The spread may reach 1,000 basis points before the end of
the year, Standard Bank Plc said.  “Germany’s plans for burden-sharing in the event of a
euro-zone default and the re-statement of the no-bailout law
present challenges to the debt market,”  Steve Barrow , head of
research for Group-of-10 currencies, said today in a research
note. “We suspect that the 10-year Greek spread over Germany
will scale 1,000 basis points and Ireland 500 basis points,
probably before the end of the year.”  Portuguese Debt  Portuguese 10-year bonds dropped, pushing the yield up 14
basis points to 6.33 percent, the highest since Oct. 7. The
Portuguese-German spread widened 13 basis points to 375 basis
points, the most since Oct. 14, based on closing prices.  The cost of insuring against losses on euro-region
government bonds increased today, led by Ireland, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Ireland jumped 28 basis points to 526,
surpassing yesterday’s record closing price, according to data
provider CMA. Greek credit default swaps climbed 18 basis points
to 850, the highest level since Sept. 17, while Portugal’s added
15.5 basis points to 395, the most in almost one month. Spanish
swaps rose 6 basis points to 230 and swaps for Italy increased
3.5 basis points to 178.5, CMA prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  Finland raised 1 billion euros in a sale of 3.375 percent
bonds maturing in April 2020 and 500 million euros in a sale of
4 percent securities due in July 2025. Demand exceeded supply in
today’s auctions, with investors bidding for 1.92 times the
amount of 2020 debt on offer. That compares with a so-called
bid-to-offer of 1.60 times at the previous sale of the same
securities on June 1. The bid-to-cover ratio on the 2025 bonds
rose to 1.69 times from 1.48 at the previous auction of the same
bonds, held April 20.  The German government plans to sell an additional five
billion euros of 1.75 percent notes due October 2015 tomorrow.  German bonds have returned 8.2 percent this year, compared
with an 8.7 percent gain for U.S. Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have lost 16 percent,
while Irish debt has lost 6.9 percent. Portuguese bonds have
lost 5.7 percent, while Finnish securities have returned 7.2
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
