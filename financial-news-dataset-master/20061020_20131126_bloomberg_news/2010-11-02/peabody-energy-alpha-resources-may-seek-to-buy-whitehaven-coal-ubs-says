Peabody Energy Corp. , the largest U.S.
coal producer, and  Alpha Natural Resources Inc.  may seek to buy
 Whitehaven Coal Ltd.  after the Australian mining company
announced a formal bidding process last week, UBS AG said.  Whitehaven may be seeking offers of A$7.50 a share or more,
with other possible bidders including China Shenhua Energy Co.
and Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., UBS said. That would value the
Sydney-based company at A$3.7 billion ($3.6 billion).  “ Peabody Energy  may be interested as they have previously
attempted to take over” Macarthur Coal Ltd. in a $3.7 billion
failed cash bid this year and have “made no secret of wanting
to secure further assets in Australia,”  Glyn Lawcock , an
analyst at UBS said in the Nov. 1. note to clients.  Whitehaven is open to takeovers as well as transactions
such as joint ventures, Managing Director  Tony Haggarty  said
last week. Overseas companies have targeted coal producers in
Australia, the world’s biggest exporter of the fuel, as prices
are expected to gain until 2012, according to forecasts from
Deutsche Bank AG.  Whitehaven  dropped 1 percent to A$6.84 at 1:33 p.m. in
Sydney trading, compared with a 0.1 percent drop in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index. UBS raised Whitehaven to a “buy”
from a “neutral” rating. Four analysts out of 12 have a buy
rating on the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
