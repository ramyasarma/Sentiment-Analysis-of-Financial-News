Asian currencies advanced for a
fourth day on speculation the Federal Reserve will step up asset
purchases, boosting the supply of U.S. dollars that can be
invested in higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia Dollar Index  gained 0.1 percent
to 115.60 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, less than 0.3 percent
shy of its Oct. 15 close of 115.93, the highest since February
2008. The Philippine peso led gains and climbed 0.6 percent to
42.755 against the dollar, its strongest level since May 2008.
South Korea’s won rose 0.3 percent to 1,113.65 and earlier
touched a two-week high of 1,111.09.  “The focus of the market is on quantitative easing,” said
 Sung Jae Man , a currency analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc. in
Seoul. “But the market is uncertain about what the Fed will do,
so we’re not seeing a big move in the currencies.”  The Fed bought $1.7 trillion of debt from December 2008
through March to help end a recession in the U.S. and economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predict at least another $500 billion of
so-called quantitative easing will be announced when a two-day
policy meeting concludes tomorrow. The central bank may limit
the amount of purchases as it risks being criticized overseas
for stoking inflation, Tong Yang Securities’ Sung said.  Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations agreed last
month in South Korea to refrain from “competitive devaluation”
and to let markets set exchange rates more.  Growth, Rates  All of Asia’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen
have strengthened against the dollar this year, led by 11
percent gains in the Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit. The
world’s fastest economic growth and interest-rate increases are
spurring inflows.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 9.4 percent in 2010,
compared with growth of 2.7 percent in advanced countries, the
International Monetary Fund forecast in October. The U.S. and
Japan have cut benchmark interest rates to near-zero and used
money-printing to spur growth, while central banks in India,
South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand have all raised
borrowing costs this year to contain inflation.  The Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates for a sixth
time this year in Asia’s fastest round of increases. The bank
boosted the repurchase rate by a quarter-point to 6.25 percent
and the reverse repurchase rate by a similar margin to 5.25
percent with immediate effect, according to a statement in
Mumbai. India’s rupee appreciated 0.2 percent to 44.39.  Stock markets in India, South Korea and Taiwan attracted
more than $10 billion from abroad in October, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Foreigners bought more of Malaysia’s
government bonds than they sold for an 11th month in September,
boosting their holdings to a record 68 billion ringgit ($22
billion), according to central bank data published Oct. 29.  Yield Advantage  “Economic conditions in Asia are more solid than the other
regions and they have a yield advantage over the U.S., helping
to boost inflows and the values of their currencies,” said
 Tohru Nishihama , an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in Tokyo.  The peso was supported by speculation overseas funds will
boost holdings of the nation’s assets as rising remittances for
the holiday season bolster the currency. Onshore financial
markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  Central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said on Oct. 29 the
surplus on the balance of payments will likely total $8.2
billion this year on higher exports and investments. Remittances,
or money sent home by overseas Filipinos, are on track to meet
an 8 percent growth target this year, he said.  “The economic outlook is improving and investors want to
join the December rally” in the peso, said  Marcelo Ayes , senior
vice president for treasury at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in
Manila. “There are natural flows from remittances.”  The Singapore dollar added 0.2 percent to S$1.2892 and
earlier touched S$1.2880, the strongest level since Bloomberg
began collecting data in 1981. The Malaysian ringgit rose 0.2
percent to 3.091 while the Chinese yuan jumped 0.3 percent to
6.6791. The Indonesian rupiah and the Thai baht were little
changed at 8,927 and 29.83, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
