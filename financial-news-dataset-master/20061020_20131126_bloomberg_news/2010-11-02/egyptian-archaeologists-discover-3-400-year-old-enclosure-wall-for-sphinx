A team of Egyptian archaeologists has
uncovered the remains of a 3,400-year-old wall on the Giza
plateau that once protected the Sphinx from desert winds, the
country’s  Supreme Council of Antiquities  said.  The two sections of mud-brick wall, which stretch for 132
meters (433 feet) in total, have been dated to the reign of
Thutmose IV, the council said in an e-mailed statement.
According to ancient Egyptian texts, the pharaoh built the
enclosure after the Sphinx appeared to him in a dream
complaining that it was being choked by sand.  The team also uncovered a third, older section of wall that
is believed to be part of a settlement for priests and officials
overseeing the mortuary cult of the pharaoh Khafre, the
secretary-general of the council,  Zahi Hawass , said, according
to the statement.  Egypt’s government is building its own wall around the Giza
site to protect the monuments from looters and prevent touts
from disturbing visitors. Tourism, which accounts for 12.6
percent of jobs, is one of the country’s main sources of foreign
currency and brought in $10.8 billion last year, according to
the Tourism Ministry.  Khafre, also known as Chephren, died in about 2532 BC after
building the second of the pyramids that dominate the necropolis
at Giza. It is commonly believed the statue of the Sphinx was
also built during his reign, historians have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
