Zions Bancorporation , a Salt Lake
City-based bank holding company, has created a unit to finance
clean energy projects costing between $10 million and $100
million.  Zions Energy Link will fund projects through affiliates in
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico,
Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington, the company said in an e-
mailed statement.  Zions has already financed numerous “energy efficiency and
sustainable programs.”  Craig Robb, chief financial officer of Zion’s National Bank
of Arizona subsidiary and managing director of Zions Energy
Link, did not say how much funding the holding company has
provided in the past or how much Energy Link has available for
renewable energy projects. He expects the new unit to fund about
twice as much this year as the holding company did last year.  National Bank of Arizona, of Phoenix, has already funded
more than $100 million in clean energy projects in Arizona,
according to the statement.  The bank’s  Solar Phoenix  residential solar financing
program, a partnership with utility  Arizona Public Service Co. 
and solar panel installer SolarCity, has funded $25 million of
installations over the past year.  National Bank of Arizona completed a rooftop solar
 expansion  last week at its headquarters, to more than 400-
kilowatts, or enough to provide the building with 25 percent of
its electricity, Robb said. The bank expects a return on its
investment in less than four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
