U.K. auto insurers will have to
accelerate price increases in 2011 after making a loss of
1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) this year, according to
research by Deloitte LLP.  Rising injury claims, insufficient premium income and lower
reserve releases from prior years are hurting car insurers,
Deloitte said today. The industry made a loss of 1.6 billion
pounds in 2009, according to the research.  “The only way the industry will return to profit is with
sustained rate increases through to 2011,” said  James Rakow ,
an insurance partner at Deloitte. “The challenge for motor
insurers will be to do this and at the same time retain their
customers.”  British car insurers including  Aviva Plc ,  RSA Insurance
Group Plc  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s Direct Line
have been raising prices in the past year to combat climbing
claims costs spurred on by “no win, no fee” lawyers and
car hire firms. Deloitte expects prices to rise further even
as the average cost of annual cover increased 40 percent to
792 pounds in the year to Sept. 30, according to The Automobile
Association Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
