Canada’s main opposition party said
it’s “troubled” by a report the government may approve  BHP
Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile offer for  Potash Corp.  of
Saskatchewan Inc.  Investment Canada, the agency reviewing the bid, has
recommended that Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s government
approve the takeover with conditions, The  National Post  reported
today, citing unidentified people within the ruling Conservative
Party.  The bureaucrats reviewing the offer proposed that a group
be set up to monitor whether the Australian company follows
through on promises made by BHP, the paper said. A decision on
whether to approve or block the bid is expected by Nov. 3.  “This is a bad deal for Saskatchewan and a bad deal for
Canada,” Liberal Party Deputy Leader  Ralph Goodale , a member of
Parliament from Saskatchewan, said in a statement today. “The
Province has said no, and the Conservatives would ignore that
advice at their peril.”  The Post article is “wrong” to say that Harper will make
the final decision, Andrew MacDougall, a spokesman for Harper,
wrote in an e-mail message. The decision is made by Industry
Minister  Tony Clement , he said, adding he didn’t know what
recommendation Investment Canada may have made.  Erik Waddell, a spokesman for Clement, declined to comment
on Investment Canada’s recommendation.  The Canadian government makes its decision based on whether
it thinks the takeover provides a “net benefit” to the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
