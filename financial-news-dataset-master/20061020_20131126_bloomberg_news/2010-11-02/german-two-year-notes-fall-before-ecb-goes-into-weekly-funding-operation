German two-year notes fell before the
European Central Bank’s weekly refinancing operation, results of
which will show the amount of excess liquidity in the money
market and may influence short-term interest rates.  The declines pushed the  yield  on the two-year note close to
the highest level in nearly eight months. The ECB offers one-
week funding at its main refinancing operation, with 183.4
billion ($256 billion) of loans expiring. Finland plans to sell
as much as 1.5 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2020 and 2025
today, while Belgium auctions up to 2.8 billion euros of three-
and six-month Treasury Bills.  “Focus is on the ECB’s seven-day tender allotment today,”
said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income analyst at WestLB AG in
Dusseldorf, Germany. “For the short end of the bund curve, it’s
all about excess liquidity. There’s uncertainty over the size of
the allotment, and that uncertainty is reflected in higher
short-term rates.”  The two-year note yield gained two basis points, to 0.99
percent as of 9:28 a.m. in London. It reached 1.01 percent
earlier today and reached 1.07 percent on Oct. 27, the highest
since March 12. The 0.75 percent security maturing in September
2012 fell 0.04, or 40 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to
99.56. The yield on the 10-year bund, Europe’s benchmark
security, was little changed at 2.47 percent.  Two-year notes stayed lower after data showed Europe’s
 manufacturing industries  expanded at a faster pace last month
than initially estimated, led by Germany.  A  gauge  of manufacturing in the 16-nation euro region
climbed to 54.6 in October from 53.7 in September, London-based
Markit Economics said today. It had previously reported an
increase to 54.1. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. In
Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the  manufacturing  index
jumped to 56.6 from 55.1, Markit said.  German bonds have returned 8.2 percent this year, compared
with an 8.7 percent gain for U.S. Treasuries, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Finnish securities have returned
7.2 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
