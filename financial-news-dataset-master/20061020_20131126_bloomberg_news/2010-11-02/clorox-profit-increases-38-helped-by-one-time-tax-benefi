Clorox Co. , the maker of household-
cleaning products like its namesake bleach, dropped the most in
almost two years after lowering 2011 profit forecasts.  The shares fell 4.2 percent. Profit from continuing
operations will be as much as $4.20 a share for the year ending
in June. In August, Clorox predicted net income of as much as
$4.65. Including discontinued operations, profit may be as high
as $4.35, the Oakland, California-based  company  said today.  The maker of Kingsford charcoal and Brita water filters
said sales declined amid slumping demand and currency swings.
The company spent more on raw materials such as resin and to
promote its products in stores.  “We faced a challenging economic environment, as evidenced
by category softness in the U.S. along with the impact of the
Venezuela currency devaluation,” said Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Don Knauss .  Net income rose to $216 million, or $1.52 a share, the
 company  said today. Earnings from continuing operations were 98
cents. That compared with the $1.13 average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit was helped by a $60 million tax benefit related to
the sale of Clorox’s STP and Armor All auto-care brands to
private-equity firm Avista Capital Partners for about $780
million in cash.  Clorox fell $2.79 to $63.52 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The drop was the largest since
December 2008.  On Oct. 27,  Procter & Gamble  Co., the world’s largest
consumer-products company, reported a first-quarter profit of
$3.08 billion, or $1.02 a share, exceeding some analysts’
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
