Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. ordered two
200,000-ton-class oil tankers from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
for 20 billion yen ($247.7 million), the company’s first such
order in more than two years as China increases oil imports,
Nikkei English News reported on its website, without saying
where it got the information.  Mitsui OSK has 41 large tankers, Nikkei said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
