London luxury-home values fell for a
second month in October as more properties were put on the
market and fewer people tried to purchase them,  Knight Frank LLP 
said.  Prices of houses and apartments costing at least 1 million
pounds ($1.6 million) fell 0.2 percent from September, the
London-based property broker said in a statement today. That
reduced the annual gain to about 12 percent, the smallest since
January.  “Demand for property has fallen back over recent months
and supply has risen,”  Liam Bailey , Knight Frank’s head of
residential research, said in the statement. “It seems likely
that this trend has some way to go.”  Values have declined 1 percent since June as a recovery in
prices that began in April 2009 persuaded more owners to sell.
Parts of central London, such as Chelsea and Kensington, still
registered higher values in October because of demand from
overseas buyers taking advantage of the  pound’s weakness .  The pound, which traded above $2 in July 2008, is now worth
about $1.60. The U.K. currency has lost 12 percent against the
dollar in the past 18 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
