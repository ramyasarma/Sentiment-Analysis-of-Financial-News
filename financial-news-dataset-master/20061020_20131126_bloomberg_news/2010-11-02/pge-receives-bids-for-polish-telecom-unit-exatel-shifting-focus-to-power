PGE SA , Poland’s largest utility,
said today it received “several” bids for Exatel SA, the phone
company it plans to sell this year to tighten its focus on power
generation and trading.  Warsaw-based  PGE  is selling 94 percent of Exatel, which
generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization of 153.2 million zloty ($54 million) last year from
operating Poland’s second-largest telecommunications network.
The bids aren’t binding, spokeswoman Sylwia Filimon said in an
e-mail today, without naming the bidders.  PGE may get 800 million zloty from the sale, reporting a
pretax profit of as much as 400 million zloty,  Pawel Puchalski ,
an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA in Warsaw, said in a research
note last month.  Earlier this year  Netia SA , the country’s second-largest
fixed-line phone company, said it may bid for Exatel. GTS
Central Europe will also analyze the sale, the PAP newswire
reported on Oct. 18. Polkomtel SA, Poland’s largest mobile phone
operator, in which PGE is also selling a stake, said in August
it’s interested.  -- Editors:  Nathaniel Espino ,  James Cone   To contact the reporter on this story:
