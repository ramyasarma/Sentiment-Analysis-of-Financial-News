Medco Health Solutions Inc.  rose the
most in two years after the company increased its 2010 earnings
forecast.  Earnings excluding certain items will be $3.38 a share to
$3.40 a share this year, from a July projection of $3.34 to
$3.39, the Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company said today
in a statement. Medco also said adjusted 2011 profit would be
$3.80 a share to $3.93 a share.  Medco  is the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the U.S.
based on revenue and the number of prescriptions it fills. The
company, which helps health plans manage their drug costs, will
gain from the introduction of new cheaper generic drugs through
2020,  David Snow , chief executive officer, said in a statement.
Next year would be “the lightest we will see in the decade,”
he said.  Generic Lipitor, a drug to lower cholesterol, is expected
to add 3 cents in earnings to 2011 results with just one month
availability,  David Larsen , an analyst with Boston-based Leerink
Swann & Co. said today in a research report. “2012 is the
monster year, and investors are looking past 2011 to 2012
earnings.” Larsen said.  Medco’s  shares  rose 11 percent, or $5.63, to close at $58
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for the
biggest single-day increase since Oct. 13, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
