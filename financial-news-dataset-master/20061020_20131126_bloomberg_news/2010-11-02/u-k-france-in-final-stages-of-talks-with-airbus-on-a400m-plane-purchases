The U.K. and France, pledging greater
cooperation in defense capabilities, said they are in the
“final stages of negotiations” with industry over the future
of Airbus SAS A400M military transport planes.  In a declaration on defense and security cooperation
jointly released by British Prime Minister  David Cameron  and
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  today, the two nations said a
single contract with Airbus Military will be signed by the end
of next year.  “We are developing a common support plan for our future
fleets of A400M transport aircraft,” the declaration said,
according to the text released by Cameron’s office in London.
“This will reduce costs, improve spares availability and open
the way for further cooperation in maintenance, logistics and
training for both deployed and home-based operations.  The nations said they will establish a “joint user group”
to facilitate cooperation on the development of A400M training
“to inform operating techniques and procedures as well as
exploring opportunities for synthetic and live training.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
