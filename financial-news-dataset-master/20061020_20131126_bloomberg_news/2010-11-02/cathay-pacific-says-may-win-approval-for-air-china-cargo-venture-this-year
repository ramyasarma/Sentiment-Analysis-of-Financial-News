Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. , Hong
Kong’s biggest carrier, said an air cargo venture with  Air China
Ltd.  may gain regulatory approval as early as this year, later
than the company had initially planned.  “We expect approval by the end of this year or early next
year,” Cathay Chief Executive Officer  Tony Tyler  said today in
Tokyo. He didn’t say why the approval was taking longer than
anticipated or whether the delay would affect earnings.  Cathay, which had expected the venture to begin operations
last month, is set to receive Boeing Co. 747-8 freighters next
year to help meet demand for cargo flights. Freight traffic
gained 25 percent in the first nine months of this year,
compared with a year earlier, according to the International Air
Transport Association.  Cargo revenue climbed 63 percent at Hong Kong-based Cathay
in the six months to June 30, as rising job confidence stoked
U.S. and European demand for Asian-made televisions and Apple
Inc. iPads.  Cathay rose 0.7 percent to close at HK$21.10 in Hong Kong
trading today. The stock has advanced 46 percent this year,
compared with an 8.2 percent gain in the Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
