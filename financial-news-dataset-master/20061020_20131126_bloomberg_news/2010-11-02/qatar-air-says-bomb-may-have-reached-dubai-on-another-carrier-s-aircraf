Qatar Airways Ltd. said there was a
“possibility” that a U.S.-bound bomb discovered in Dubai may
have traveled to the city from Yemen on board another carrier’s
aircraft.  Information from a FedEx Corp. shipping document suggests
the package may not have flown on Qatar planes, the Doha-based
airline’s Chief Executive Officer  Akbar Al Baker  told reporters
in Hanoi today. The carrier on Oct. 31 said it had flown
explosives on board two passenger flights.  “There’s a possibility that this package actually wasn’t
carried by Qatar Airways,” Al Baker said. The original
information was “immature and not properly researched,” he
said.  Governments worldwide have stepped up air-cargo security
measures since two bombs headed for synagogues in Chicago were
discovered in the U.K. and Dubai following intelligence tipoffs.
The explosives were hidden in printer cartridges in packages
that originated in Yemen.  Qatar Air on Oct. 31 said the package was transported on a
flight from Sana’a, Yemen, to Doha, Qatar before being carried
onto Dubai.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
