The chairman of Kenya’s Truth,
Justice and Reconciliation Commission,  Bethuel Kiplagat , stepped
down temporarily pending the outcome of a probe into alleged
corruption and human-rights abuses.  Tecla Namachanja will become acting chairwoman of the
commission, she told reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  “We would like to assure the people of  Kenya  of the
unequivocal commitment of the commissioners and the staff to
redouble our efforts to ensure the fulfillment of the mandate
entrusted to us,” Namachanja said.  The commission was established to investigate human-rights
violations, including those committed by the state, groups or
individuals since independence on Dec. 12, 1963, until February
2008. The probe will cover ethnic violence that erupted in the
wake of disputed elections in December 2007, leaving 1,500
people dead and forcing another 300,000 to flee their homes.  Ron Slye, a commissioner who on Oct. 22 announced his
intention to resign because of the unresolved allegations
against Kiplagat and a lack of financial support from the
government, rescinded his decision today, he said in an e-mailed
statement.  “The chairman’s stepping aside addresses one of the two
reasons I cited for my decision to resign,” Slye said. “It is my
hope that with the decision of the chairman to step aside, the
government of Kenya and others will be willing to provide the
commission with the resources it needs to fulfill its mandate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
