Whole milk powder auction prices
rose for the first time in six week, according to  Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd.,  the world’s largest dairy exporter.  Powder for January delivery gained 0.9 percent from two
weeks earlier, according to a trade-weighted price index
calculated by the company after its latest  GlobalDairyTrade 
auction. The average price rose to $3,516 a ton, and is the
highest for the spot contract since Oct. 6.  Fonterra accounts for about 40 percent of the global trade
in butter, milk powder and cheese, selling $12 billion of
product a year in 140 countries.  In September, the company raised its farmer payout forecast
citing rising global prices. There are signs that international
dairy supply and demand are “moving more in balance at
prevailing prices,” Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Ferrier  said
in a statement on Sept. 23.  Fonterra sells whole and skim milk powder and dried milk
fat at its fortnightly Internet-based auctions. It offers one-
month  contract s with delivery starting two months after the sale,
and two three-month contracts with delivery starting three and
six months later.  Whole milk powder for delivery from February through April
rose 0.9 percent, Fonterra said. Powder for shipment from May
through July slumped 6.7 percent. Across all contracts prices
were unchanged.  The winning first-contract price for regular New
Zealand whole milk powder, which is the reference point for NZX
Ltd.’s futures contract, rose to $3,490. The November futures
contract settled yesterday at $3,430.  To contact the reporter on this story:
