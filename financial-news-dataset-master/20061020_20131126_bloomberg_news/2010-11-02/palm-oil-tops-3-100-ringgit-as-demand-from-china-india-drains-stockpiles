Palm oil futures climbed to the
highest level in more than two years on speculation growth in
supplies of cooking oils may fail to match the increase in
demand from China, Pakistan and Europe.  The January-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange rose as much as 0.5 percent to 3,106 ringgit ($1,003) a
metric ton and ended the morning session at 3,100 ringgit. The
most-active contract closed at 3,092 ringgit yesterday, the
highest level since July 24, 2008.  “It appears production of palm and soybean oils won’t be
strong enough to match the increase in demand,” said  Arhnue Tan ,
an analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn. in Kuala Lumpur. “There
are enough drivers to keep palm oil prices up.”  Inventories of soybean and palm oils will drop 12 percent
in the coming year, the most in 17 years, as demand from China
and India expands 11 percent, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Palm oil  exports  from Malaysia, the world’s second-
biggest grower, have risen 6 percent in the nine months through
September, while  output  has risen 1.6 percent to 12.7 million
tons, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  Soybean oil has jumped 22 percent this year in Chicago as a
lack of rain in the center-west of Brazil is delaying planting
in a region that grows 47 percent of the country’s soybeans, the
world’s second-largest crop behind the U.S.  “Weather concerns are real and demand from countries like
China and Pakistan are robust,” ECM Libra’s Tan said. “China
is importing huge quantities of soybeans and may buy more to
build reserves and check prices.”  New Year Holiday  Demand from China, the largest user of edible oils, will
increase in the months ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in
February. Its soybean imports in the 2010-11 marketing year may
be as much as 60 million tons, according to unidentified global
grain trading companies cited by the China National Grain & Oils
Information Center.  Soybeans traded in Chicago gained as much as 0.5 percent to
$12.41 a bushel and traded at $12.4025 at 1:02 p.m. in Singapore.
Soybean oil for December delivery added as much as 0.3 percent
to 49.92 cents a pound, extending last month’s 9.3 percent gain.  Palm oil for September delivery, the most-active contract
on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, climbed as much as 1.4 percent
to 8,740 yuan ($1,308) a ton, while September-delivery soybean
oil added as much as 0.7 percent to 9,632 yuan a ton.  CME Group Inc.’s January palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, increased as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,001.75 a ton, the highest level since the contract began
trading in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
