Wheat futures fell for the third
straight session as Egypt shunned supplies from the U.S., the
world’s largest exporter, in a tender today.  Egypt, the biggest importer, bought a combined 230,000
metric tons from France, Argentina and Australia. In the week
ended Oct. 28, U.S. wheat  inspected  for export dropped 31
percent from a week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said
yesterday.  “There are other people out there who are still selling it
cheaper than we are, so we’re not seeing big sales like we did a
few weeks back,” said  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler
Commodities LLC in Augusta, Kansas.  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 6.5 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $6.96 a bushel at 11:54 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The price fell 2.2 percent in the previous two
sessions.  Before today, the grain climbed 46 percent since the end of
June as drought harmed crops in Russia and Eastern Europe.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
