Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said it’s better “to be passionate about” pretty
women than gay men and repeated that he helped a 17-year-old
dancer out of kindness.  After media reports, Berlusconi, 74, admitted last week he
had aided a girl who had been arrested for theft earlier this
year. The girl, who goes by the name Ruby, later told
prosecutors she had attended parties with sex games at
Berlusconi’s Milan villa and that the premier gave her money and
gifts, newspapers including la Repubblica have reported.
Berlusconi denied any wrongdoing.  “It was merely an act of solidarity” to help the woman,
Berlusconi said during a speech today at the motorcycle
industry’s annual conference near Milan. “I work all the time.
I sometimes take the liberty of looking at a beautiful woman’s
face. It’s better to be passionate about beautiful women than
gay men.”  Italy’s largest gay rights organization, Arcigay, said
Berlusconi should apologize, according to the group’s  website .  “It’s unacceptable that the head of a government, who is
clearly in a difficult position because of his senile passions,
should be so macho and vulgar and make a senseless statement
about gays, lesbians and transsexuals,” Arcigay President Paolo
Patane said. “Arcigay demands an immediate, official apology.”  After a European Union summit in Brussels on Oct. 29,
Berlusconi said he had merely acted to help a young woman “in a
tragic situation,” while he denied pressuring police officials
to release her.  “At my age, nobody will be able to make me change my
lifestyle,” he said last week. “I love life and fun, I love
women.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
