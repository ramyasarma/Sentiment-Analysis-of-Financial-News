Kubota Corp. , Asia’s largest farm
equipment maker, said first-half profit rose 33 percent on
increased sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia outside Japan.  Net income rose to 25.7 billion yen ($319 million) from
19.3 billion yen a year earlier, the company said in a statement.
Kubota left its full-year forecast unchanged at 52 billion yen.  “Although sales may be better in the second half, the
strong yen may cause difficulties,” President  Yasuo Masumoto 
said today at a briefing in Osaka, where the company is based.
“We’ve got factories in China and Thailand, but like the
automobile industry, our overseas production ratio is low.”  The company would have to “take more measures” if the yen
strengthened to below 80 yen per dollar, Masumoto said. The
Japanese currency, which has gained 14 percent against the U.S.
dollar since Kubota’s fiscal year started April 1, traded at
80.60 as of 5 p.m. in Tokyo.  Kubota reported operating profit, or sales minus the cost
of goods sold and administrative expenses, rose 30 percent to
43.2 billion yen in the first half, compared with the 42.9
billion yen average of four analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Revenue  jumped 1 percent to 449 billion yen, less
than the 459.2 billion yen expected by the analysts.  The shares rose 0.3 percent to close at 719 yen as of 3 p.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark  Nikkei  225 Stock
Average added 0.1 percent.  Sales of farming and construction machinery rose 6.8
percent from a year earlier to 330.7 billion yen to comprise
about 74 percent of Kubota’s first-half  revenue .  “In terms of machinery makers, they’re an extremely rare
growing company,”  Tsutomu Kijima , an analyst at Barclays Plc in
Tokyo who has an “overweight/neutral” rating on Kubota’s stock,
said before the results were announced. “Demand for
agricultural machinery in Asia will continue to grow in the
short-to-medium term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
