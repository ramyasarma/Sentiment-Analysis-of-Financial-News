The People’s Bank of China sold one-
year bills at a yield of 2.2913 percent, unchanged from last
week, according to traders at Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  The monetary authority offered 51 billion yuan ($7.6
billion) of the securities at the auction today, the most since
Sept. 21.  The central bank allowed the yield to rise 20 basis points
at the auction a week ago after it raised the benchmark lending
and deposit rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Oct. 19,
the first time since 2007. Before that it had kept the rate
unchanged for 18 sales in a row.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
