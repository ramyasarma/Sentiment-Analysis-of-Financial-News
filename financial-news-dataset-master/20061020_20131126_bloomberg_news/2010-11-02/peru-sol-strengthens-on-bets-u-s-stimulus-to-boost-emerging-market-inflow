Peru’s sol climbed to the strongest
level in a week on speculation that measures to bolster the U.S.
economy will spur demand for higher-yielding assets in emerging
markets with steeper interest rates.  The sol gained 0.2 percent to 2.7931 per U.S. dollar at
12:58 p.m. New York time, from 2.7985 on Oct. 29. The currency
earlier touched 2.7928, the strongest since Oct. 26. Peruvian
markets were closed yesterday for a national holiday.  U.S. policy makers meeting today and tomorrow will probably
announce a plan to purchase at least $500 billion of long-term
securities, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Five interest rate increases this year in Peru, as well as the
potential for higher prices for its commodity exports, make the
country a magnet for investment as the U.S. boosts the money
supply, said  Bertrand Delgado , an economist at Roubini Global
Economics LLC in New York.  “Managers want a larger part of their portfolios invested
in” fast-growing Latin American countries, Delgado said.  Gross domestic product in Peru, the world’s second-biggest
copper exporter, may rise 8 percent this year, according to the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
