Edison SpA , Italy’s second-largest
power generator, had its ratings cut one level by Standard &
Poor’s because of higher debt and tough market conditions.  S&P lowered the long-term corporate credit and senior
unsecured debt ratings to BBB from BBB+ and changed the outlook
to stable from negative.  “Increasing adjusted debt levels and difficult market
conditions have weakened the credit metrics,” S&P said today in
a note. Current market conditions make it unlikely that measures
implemented by the company “will be sufficient to restore
Edison’s credit metrics to a level that we would consider
commensurate to the previous rating.”  The ratings company said Milan-based Edison’s purchase of
the Abu Qir gas field and commissioning of the Rovigo LNG
terminal contributed to an increase in adjusted debt. Market
conditions and the failure to renegotiate gas procurement
contracts also hurt the company.  Edison reported a 54 percent slump in third-quarter profit
on Oct. 26 due to the cost of gas procurement contracts that
were signed when oil prices were higher. Edison said it will
have to wait until next year to renegotiate the contracts
because of the complexity of negotiations.  S&P said the stable outlook “reflects our view that Edison
has headroom at its current rating level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
