Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. , the
venture between an Australian billionaire and the son of Macau
gambling magnate  Stanley Ho , posted a profit in the third
quarter, beating analysts’ estimates, after a second casino
boosted its share of China’s gambling boom.  Net income was $15.8 million, or 3 cents per American
depositary receipt, compared with a loss of $39.5 million, or 8
cents, a year earlier, the Hong Kong-based company said in a
regulatory  filing . Analysts had predicted a loss excluding some
items of 1 cent, the average of seven  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. It was Melco Crown’s first net profit in 10 quarters.  Xueda Debut  Xueda Education Group , the Beijing-based provider of
tutoring services for primary and secondary school students in
China, surged 32 percent after raising $128 million in its U.S.

trading after climbing as much as 55 percent. The company sold
13.43 million American depositary receipts for $9.50 each after
offering them at $7.25 to $9.25, a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and a statement showed.  Cypress Lane  Shafiq Karmali , a former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  trader,

briefed on the decision.  Investors will get back their capital in Cypress Lane Asia
Fund, which bets on both rising and falling stocks in the region,
by the end of November, said one of the people, who asked not to
be named because the information is private. The fund, with $25
million of assets as of September, lost nearly 10 percent in the
14 months since its August 2009 inception, according to a letter
sent to investors. It returned 1.5 percent in October, said the
person.  Airbus China Order  Airbus SAS, the world’s largest maker of commercial
aircraft, is poised to win a contract from China for at least
100 jets this week when President  Hu Jintao  visits France, three
people familiar with the talks said.  The accord will likely be announced during a three-day
diplomatic visit that starts Nov. 4, said the people, who
declined to be named because the order is still pending.  SMIC Profit  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , China’s
biggest chipmaker, reported a second straight quarter of profit,
helped by demand for chips used in computers and mobile phones.  Net income was $30.4 million, or 6 cents per American
depositary receipt, compared with a loss of $69.3 million, or
15.5 cents, a year earlier, the said in a Hong Kong stock

$573,000, the average of three analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales increased 27 percent to $410 million.  Yuan Trade Settlement  Trade settlement in the Chinese yuan in the third quarter

conducting transactions in the currency surged.  Total trade settled using the Chinese currency was 126.5
billion yuan ($18.9 billion) in the July-to-September period,
the People’s Bank of China said in a statement on its website.
