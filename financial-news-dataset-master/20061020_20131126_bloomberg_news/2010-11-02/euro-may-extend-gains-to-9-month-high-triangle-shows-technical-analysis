The euro may extend gains to a nine-
month high of about $1.4400 should the currency close above
major resistance at $1.4004, according to  Pak Lai Ng , a
technical analyst at Forecast Pte.  Resistance at $1.4004 represents a descending trend line
connecting the highs of Oct. 15 and Oct. 25, which form a
triangle pattern, Ng said. A triangle is created when descending
and ascending trend lines intersect. The ascending trend line
connects the lows of Oct. 20 and 27, according to Ng.  “The euro is at the top of a triangle, and it looks like
it’ll break above the descending trend line,” Singapore-based
Ng said in an interview. “This would be bullish and means the
triangle is a continuation pattern.”  Europe’s currency traded at $1.3901 as of 8:40 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3893 in New York yesterday, when it rose to as
high as $1.4011, the strongest level since Oct. 25.  Should the euro advance beyond the $1.4004 level, the
currency is likely to climb further to the next resistance level
at the Oct. 15 high of $1.4159, Ng said. Resistance is where
sell orders may be clustered.  The euro target of $1.4400, last seen on Jan. 19, is
calculated by adding the difference between the Oct. 20 low of
$1.3698 and the $1.4119 level, the top of the triangle reached
the same day, to $1.4004, according to Ng.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
