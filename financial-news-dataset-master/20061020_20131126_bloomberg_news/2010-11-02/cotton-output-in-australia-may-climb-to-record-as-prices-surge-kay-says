Cotton production in Australia, the
fourth-largest exporter, is forecast to reach an all-time high
this season as record prices and above-average rainfall prompts
increased planting, according to a producers’ group.  Output may more than double to 3.7 million to 3.8 million
bales from 470,000 hectares (1.2 million acres), according to
Cotton Australia Chief Executive Officer  Adam Kay . That compares
with an October forecast of at least 3.5 million bales from
450,000 hectares. A bale weighs 227 kilograms (500 pounds).  Cotton futures have surged to a record as cold weather
curbs output in China amid a global supply shortage before
northern hemisphere crops become available. Australia had its
third-wettest October, according to the Melbourne-based  Bureau
of Meteorology , raising water levels in irrigation dams and
boosting farmers’ confidence in planting crops that rely on rain.  “Because the prices have hit these record highs, that has
encouraged people,” Kay said by phone today. “I heard one guy
describe the other day how people are planting everything bar
the tennis court.” Sowing was 80 percent to 90 percent finished
and would be completed in about 10 days, he said.  December-delivery cotton advanced as much as 1.9 percent to
a record $1.3176 a pound today on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
before trading at $1.3160 at 5:24 p.m. Melbourne time.  Australian output is rebounding from 1.7 million bales last
harvest and a 30-year low of about 500,000 bales in 2007-2008,
when drought cut production, according to industry figures. The
crop reached a record 819,000 metric tons (3.6 million bales) in
2000-2001, government data show. The season runs from August to
July, with harvesting from March to May.  Water Supplies  Water storages in the Murray Darling Basin, where more than
90 percent of Australia’s cotton is grown, were 73 percent full
as of Oct. 27, data on the basin management authority’s  website 
showed. The basin had the most October rainfall since 1975 as a
La Nina weather event, characterized by cooling tropical Pacific
Ocean temperatures, brought wet weather to Australia’s east,
according to the Bureau of Meteorology.  Global cotton output will rise 16 percent in the year to
July 31 to 25.3 million tons as high prices boost planting, the
Washington-based International Cotton Advisory Committee said
yesterday in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
