The pound snapped a two-day gain
against the euro after a report showed U.K. construction growth
slowed more than forecast in October.  The British currency remained near the highest level in
nine months against the dollar before policymakers from the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the Bank of England meet to decide on
interest rates and debt-buying measures this week. Ten-year
gilts climbed after the construction report, even as the  FTSE
100 Index  of shares jumped 0.8 percent.  “The pound has fallen because we’ve had a weak
construction number and the euro is stronger today,” said
 Adrian Schmidt , a foreign-exchange strategist at Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in London. “We are going to see some weaker numbers
out of the U.K.”  The pound depreciated 1.1 percent to 87.60 pence per euro
as of 4:20 p.m. in London and slipped 0.1 percent to $1.6019.
Sterling weakened against all but the yen among its 16 most
actively traded counterparts.  The October construction purchasing managers index fell to
51.6 from 53.8 in September, according to Markit Economics Ltd.
and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. Economists
forecast a decline to 53.  The Fed is likely to start a fresh round of unorthodox
stimulus tomorrow by announcing a plan to purchase at least $500
billion of long-term securities, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The BOE will keep its asset-purchase
target unchanged at 200 billion pounds two days later, a
separate survey showed.  ‘Holding Pattern’  “We’re in a holding pattern until the Fed decision
tomorrow,” said  Daragh Maher , deputy head of global foreign-
exchange strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in London. “If the package is bigger than expected then the
pound should push higher, but if it’s relatively small then
sterling could drop back.”  U.K. 10-year gilt yields fell one basis point to 3.03
percent. The 4.75 percent security due March 2020 rose 0.115, or
1.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 113.89. Two-year
yields were little changed at 0.69 percent.  The debt office sold 4 billion pounds of new 2 percent
notes maturing in January 2016 today. Investors bid for two
times the amount of securities offered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
