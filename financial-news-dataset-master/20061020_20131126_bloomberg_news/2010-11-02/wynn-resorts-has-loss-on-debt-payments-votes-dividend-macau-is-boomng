Wynn Resorts Ltd. , owner of the Wynn
and Encore casinos, reported a third-quarter net loss from costs
to repay debt early. The board voted to pay a special dividend
of $8 a share.  The net loss of $33.5 million, or 27 cents a share,
compared with profit of $34.2 million, or 28 cents, a year
earlier, Las Vegas-based Wynn said today in a statement.
Excluding items, profit of 39 cents compared with the 40-cent
average estimate of 23  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg.  Macau is booming as Wynn’s Las Vegas home market recovers
from its steepest gambling and convention decline. The company
opened Encore Macau in April, doubling its presence in the
world’s biggest casino market, where overall gambling revenue
surged 59 percent this year through October.  “We’ve seen the bottom in Las Vegas,” founder and Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Wynn  said today on a conference call.
“I don’t know how fast it’s going to get better, but I don’t
think it’s going to get any worse.”  The company is “ready to begin’ site work on a third Macau
resort in the Cotai area, Wynn said. The project will  cost  $2
billion to $3 billion and open in 2015, employing as many as
15,000 staff, he said.  Third-quarter cash flow, measured as adjusted property
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
rose 38 percent to $274.5 million, beating the $247.9 million
analysts  estimated . Macau Ebitda climbed 55 percent to $198
million, and Las Vegas gained 9.3 percent to $76.5 million.  Macau Revenue  Wynn’s Macau revenue climbed 50 percent, boosting company
sales 30 percent to $1.01 billion from $773.1 million a year
earlier and beating the $993.2 million  analysts  expected.  Gambling in the Chinese territory has surged since the
government ended  Stanley Ho ’s 40-year monopoly and let foreign
companies, including Wynn, Las Vegas Sands Corp. and MGM Resorts
International, build resorts that attract mainlanders.  Las Vegas, the biggest U.S. casino city, is emerging from a
slump that hurt room rates for more than two years. Strip
gambling revenue jumped 21 percent in August. Wynn Las Vegas’
average daily rate was unchanged in the third quarter at $210,
with room occupancy rising to 87.8 percent from 83.9 percent a
year earlier  Wynn Resorts fell $2.64 to $109.93 in extended trading
after results were announced. The stock gained $3.31 to $112.57
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  and has
almost doubled this year. Wynn Macau Ltd. fell 8 Hong Kong cents
to HK$17.18 in Asia trading. Wynn listed part of the Macau unit
in October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
