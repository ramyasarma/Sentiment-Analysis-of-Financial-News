The dollar will probably weaken as
mid-term elections today risk a political stalemate for
President  Barack Obama , while the Federal Reserve expands its
asset purchases, Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen said.  “The question is whether President Obama will lose his
majority in the Senate as well as the House of
Representatives,”  Ulrich Wortberg , a fixed-income strategist in
Frankfurt, wrote in a note to clients today. “This would make
life much more difficult for the Democratic government. A
political deadlock is possible in the remaining two years of its
term, which would generally weigh on the dollar.”  While the Fed may decide this week to buy more bonds to
boost the economy, the European Central Bank isn’t likely to
follow, Wortberg wrote.  “The conflicting policy approaches are underpinning the
euro,” he said. “The dollar should not only lose ground versus
the euro, but also against most main currencies.”  The Dollar Index fell 0.3 percent to 77.084 as of 6:51 a.m.
