U.S. corn production will fall to
12.592 billion bushels this year, compared with the government’s
October forecast of 12.664 billion, agricultural researcher
Informa Economics Inc. said today in a note to clients.  Last month, Memphis, Tennessee-based Informa estimated the
crop at 13.023 billion bushels, down from a record 13.11 billion
harvested in 2009, based on fewer acres planted and reduced
yields. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will update its
forecast on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
