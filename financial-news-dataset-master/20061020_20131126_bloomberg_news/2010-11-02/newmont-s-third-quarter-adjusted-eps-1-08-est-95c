Newmont Mining Corp. , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported third-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as the price of the metal soared. The
company raised its production cost forecast.  Net income  rose 38 percent to $537 million, or $1.07 a
share, from $388 million, or 79 cents, a year earlier, the
Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company said today in a
statement. Profit excluding gains on asset sales was $1.08 a
share, topping the 95-cent  average estimate  of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 27 percent to $2.6
billion from $2.05 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Richard O’Brien is reaping higher
prices for metals from  Newmont’s mines  in the South Pacific, the
Americas and Africa while seeking to contain rising gold
production costs. Newmont raised its cost forecast to $485 to
$500 an ounce from $460 to $480 an ounce, citing higher gold
prices and the weaker dollar.  Newmont fell $1.34, or 2.2 percent, to $59.89 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
risen 27 percent this year.  The company said its 2010 gold production will be 5.3
million to 5.4 million ounces, compared with a previous
prediction of 5.3 million to 5.5 million ounces. Newmont reduced
its full-year production forecast for its Boddington mine in
Australia to 700,000 to 750,000 ounces, from 750,000 to 825,000
ounces.  Boddington, which began commercial production a year ago,
has lagged behind Newmont’s initial projections because of
lower-than-expected ore grades, the company has said previously.  Gold for immediate delivery in London reached a record
$1,387 an ounce on Oct. 14. It averaged $1,228 an ounce in the
quarter, 28 percent more than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
