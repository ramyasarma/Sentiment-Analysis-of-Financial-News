The Scottish government has set aside
70 million pounds ($112 million) to create a fund that will help
pay for improvements in port facilities needed to spur a surge
in offshore wind power investment.  “The money comes from Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise budgets,’’ Scottish First Minister Alex
Salmond said in a telephone interview today. “It is an enormous
commitment because capital budget are at a premium now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
