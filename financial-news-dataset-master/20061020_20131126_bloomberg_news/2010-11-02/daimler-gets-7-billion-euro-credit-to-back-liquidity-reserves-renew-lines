Daimler AG, the world’s second-
biggest luxury carmaker, signed a 7 billion-euro ($9.8
billion) credit line to serve as a liquidity reserve.  Daimler doesn’t plan to use the five-year revolving credit,
which will replace the Stuttgart, Germany-based company’s $5
billion and 3 billion-euro credit lines before they expire, it
said in a statement today.  “With this credit line, we have secured today’s favorable
conditions for the next five years and have gained a solid
liquidity for the long term,” Chief Financial Officer  Bodo Uebber  said in the statement.  Daimler signed the transaction with more than 30 banks
after the deal was “significantly oversubscribed,” it said.  Deutsche Bank AG, Societe Generale SA and UniCredit SpA
coordinated the facility, which pays an initial interest at 60
basis points more than the euro interbank offered rate when
it’s drawn, compared with a 160 basis-point margin under a
credit line it agreed last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings rank Daimler’s debt
BBB+, the third-lowest investment grade. Moody’s Investors
Service rates it a level higher at A3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
