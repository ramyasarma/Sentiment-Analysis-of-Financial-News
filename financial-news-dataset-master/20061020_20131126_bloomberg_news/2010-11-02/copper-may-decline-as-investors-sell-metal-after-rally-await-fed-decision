Copper, trading little changed in
London, may decline as some investors sell following a recent
rally. Futures in New York and Shanghai fell.  Three-month copper traded at $8,287 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange at 10:29 a.m. in Singapore after gaining
as much as 0.3 percent to $8,324. December-delivery metal on the
Comex in New York fell as much as 0.4 percent to $3.77 a pound,
while futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped as much
as 0.9 percent to 63,150 yuan ($9,433) a ton.  Copper rose the most in a week yesterday as manufacturing
in China, the U.S. and the U.K. accelerated in October, boosting
confidence that the global economic recovery is intact. The
 dollar  was little changed against a basket of six currencies
ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting today and tomorrow at which a
further program of asset purchases may be announced.  “Metals had a nice rebound yesterday and are consolidating
those gains today as investors await the Federal Reserve,” said
Liu Zhuang, an analyst at Haitong Futures Co. “Near-term
direction will continue to be driven by the dollar.”  In Chile, negotiations at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata
Plc’s Chilean Collahuasi unit are under way as the company
restarted talks with workers on Oct. 29 to try and avert a
strike at the world’s fourth-largest copper mine. Miners on Oct.
27 rejected a pay offer and can legally strike from Nov. 4.  Aluminum in London was unchanged at $2,371 a ton, and
nickel gained 0.2 percent to $23,290 a ton. Zinc dropped 0.5
percent to $2,438 a ton, tin fell 0.6 percent to $25,460 a ton,
and lead declined 0.5 percent to $2,452 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
