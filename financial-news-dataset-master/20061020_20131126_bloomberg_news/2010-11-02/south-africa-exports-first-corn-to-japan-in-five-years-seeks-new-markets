South Africa exported its first
yellow corn to Japan in five years last week as the country
seeks new markets for its biggest harvest since 1982.  The country, Africa’s largest corn producer, shipped 49,780
metric tons of the grain to Japan last week, the South African
Grain Information Service said on its website today. That adds
to shipments to South Korea, Kuwait, Spain and Taiwan in the
marketing year that began May 1 in addition to exports to its
traditional markets of other African countries.  South Africa expects to reap 13.04 million tons of corn
this season, the government’s Crop Estimates Committee said on
Sept. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
