Novo Nordisk A/S had gotten an order
for 15.5 million vials of human insulin in Brazil, Jyllands-
Posten reported, citing Jesper Hoeiland, a director at Novo.  The Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company hopes the order will
help familiarize Brazilian doctors with the company, the
newspaper said, citing Hoeiland. Novo Nordisk would like to
increase its market share from around 45 percent to more than 50
percent, Jyllands-Posten said, citing Hoeiland.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
