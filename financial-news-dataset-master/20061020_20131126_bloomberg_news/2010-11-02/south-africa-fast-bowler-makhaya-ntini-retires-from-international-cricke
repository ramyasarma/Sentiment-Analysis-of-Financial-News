South Africa fast bowler Makhaya
Ntini retired from the international game, Cricket South Africa
said  on its website .  Ntini, 33, was the first black African cricketer to play
for the nation, in 1998. He’s taken 390 Test wickets -- second
only to  Shaun Pollock  -- in 101 appearances, and 266 wickets in
173 one-day internationals. He will continue to play domestic
cricket for the Chevrolet Warriors.  “It has been a wonderful journey for me to represent my
country,” he told the website. “I have so many great memories,
which I will carry with me for the rest of my life. My career is
by no means over. Domestic cricket is thriving at the moment,
and I want to be a part of the set-up, as a player, for as long
as possible.”  Ntini holds several South African records: best bowling
figures in Test cricket, 13-132 against the West Indies in 2005;
and in one-day internationals, 6-23 against Australia in 2006;
and most 10-wicket hauls in Tests -- four, shared with  Dale Steyn . He’s the only South African bowler to take 10 wickets in
a Test at Lord’s in London.  His bowling average was 28.82 in Tests and 24.65 in one-day
internationals. He’ll make one final appearance for South Africa
in a Twenty20 international with India in Durban on Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
