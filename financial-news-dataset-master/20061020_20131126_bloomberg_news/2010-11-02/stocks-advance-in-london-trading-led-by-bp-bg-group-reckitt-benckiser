U.K. stocks climbed, sending the FTSE
100 Index up by the most in almost three week, as companies from
BP Plc to BG Group Plc and International Tobacco Group Plc
reported earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  BP , the company responsible for the biggest oil spill in
U.S. history, gained 1.8 percent while smaller rival BG Group
increased 3.4 percent.  Imperial Tobacco,  the maker of Gauloise
and Davidoff cigarettes, gained 1.9 percent. Commodity related
shares also rallied as oil and metal prices climbed.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  climbed 62.81, or 1.1 percent,
to 5,757.43 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, extending last
month’s 2.3 percent rally amid speculation the Federal Reserve
will tomorrow unveil another round of bond purchases to boost
growth. The FTSE All-Share Index increased 1 percent today,
while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  gained 0.6 percent.  “Today is all about what the Fed is going to do,” said
London-based  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin
Securities Ltd., which oversees about $33 billion. “In addition
to the Fed, earnings news-flow has also been very good and
continues to beat expectations.”  BP advanced 1.8 percent to 431.65 pence after the company
reported third-quarter profit, excluding one-time items and
inventory changes, of $5.5 billion, beating the average analyst
estimate of $4.6 billion. Net income dropped 66 percent to $1.8
billion after the company took a further pretax charge of $7.7
billion related to the Gulf of Mexico well disaster.  Encouraging Finances  Chief Financial Officer  Byron Grote  today told a press
conference today in London that BP’s finances and asset sales to
date were encouraging for the dividend.  BG Group  climbed 3.4 percent to 1,252 pence after the
U.K.’s third-largest natural-gas producer reported third-quarter
profit of $978 million, excluding disposals and one-time items.
That topped the average analyst estimate of $862 million.  The company also raised its estimates for energy resources
offshore Brazil to 10.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 34
percent more than the previous estimate.  Imperial Tobacco rallied 1.9 percent to 2,035 pence after
the cigarette maker more than doubled full-year profit to 1.51
billion pounds as higher prices offset a decline in shipments.
That beat the average analyst prediction of 1.42 billion pounds.  Beat Estimate  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc  also advanced after the world’s
largest maker of household cleaners posted a 19 percent rise in
third-quarter profit to 426 million pounds. That beat an average
analyst estimate of 405.1 million-pounds. The stock gained 0.9
percent to 3,557 pence.  Antofagasta, owner of copper mines in Chile, rallied 3.2
percent to 1,384 pence as the base metal rose for a second day
in London. Xstrata Plc gained 3.2 percent to 1,295 pence and
Tullow Oil Plc, the U.K. explorer with the most licenses in
Africa, increased 4.1 percent to 1,219 pence.  Copper advanced for a second straight day and crude oil
surged to its highest level in three week as the dollar weakened
against major currencies as the Fed prepared more stimulus
measures to bolster the world’s largest economy.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  paced declining shares, falling
3.2 percent to 67.39 pence, after the mortgage lender forecast
“good” 2010 results without disclosing figures, prompting
calls for the bank to match the financial reports of its peers.
Lloyds’s Chief Executive Officer  Eric Daniels  forecast a “good
financial performance” for the full year as loan impairments
continued to decline in the third quarter.  “We see little point” to the Lloyds statement, said  Hank Calenti , head of bank credit research at Societe Generale SA.
“Today’s contained a grand total of nine numbers, excluding
repetitions,” he said, adding that there was “nothing of value
to trade on in this report.”  BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research today lowered its 2011
and 2012 earnings-per-share estimates for the mortgage lender by
14 percent and 6.3 percent respectively, saying international
bad debts were “likely to drag further in 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
