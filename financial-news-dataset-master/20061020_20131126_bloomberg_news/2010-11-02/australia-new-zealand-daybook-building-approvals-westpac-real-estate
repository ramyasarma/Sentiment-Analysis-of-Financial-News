An overview of activity since markets
closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks rose, sending the Dow Jones
Industrial Average above its highest close since the week of
Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.’s bankruptcy in 2008, as investors
awaited the Federal Reserve’s plans to bolster the recovery and
an election outcome that may hand the Democrats their biggest
defeat in seven decades.
*MasterCard Inc. rallied 2.8 percent as third-quarter profit
exceeded most Wall Street forecasts after more consumers paid
with credit and debit cards. U.S. Steel Corp. advanced 3.4
percent after being added to UBS AG’s short-term “buy” list as
the price for the metal may rise.
*The S&P 500 added 0.9 percent to 1,194.95, a six-month high.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 85.82 points, or 0.8
percent, to 11,210.44 at 1:50 p.m. in New York, the highest
since September 2008.  London: European stocks climbed as the U.S. Federal Reserve
began its two-day meeting to decide how it will support the
economic recovery.
*BP Plc gained 1.8 percent after the international oil company
beat analysts’ profit estimates.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.4 percent to 267.5 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London as more than two stocks rose for every
one that fell.  Tokyo: Most Japanese stocks fell, dragging the Topix index to
its seventh consecutive decline, as the yen traded near a 15-
year high before this week’s meetings of the U.S. Federal
Reserve and Bank of Japan.
*Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, declined 2.3
percent. Advantest Corp., the world’s biggest maker of memory-
chip testers, sank 1.3 percent.
* The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.1 percent to 9,159.98
after retreating as much as 0.3 percent.
*The Topix index fell less than 0.1 percent to 803.12 in Tokyo,
its lowest close since April 2009. Almost twice as many stocks
declined as advanced.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was little
changed at 4,701.40 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney.
The gauge reversed gains earlier after the Reserve Bank of
Australia unexpectedly increased its benchmark interest rate by
a quarter percentage point to 4.75 percent.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar fell against most of its major counterparts
on speculation a resumption of asset purchases by the Federal
Reserve will spur inflation and extend a five-month slide in the
greenback.
*The greenback fell 1 percent to $1.4037 per euro at 3:16 p.m.
in New York, from $1.3893 yesterday.
*The yen slipped 0.2 percent to 80.69 per dollar, from 80.51. It
touched 80.22 yesterday, the second time in as many trading days
it reached the strongest in 15 years.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasuries rose, led by 30-year bonds, amid forecasts
the Federal Reserve will expand asset purchases to drive
borrowing costs lower after its two-day policy meeting.
*Ten-year note yields declined for the third time in four days
as economists surveyed by Bloomberg said the U.S. central bank
will announce plans to buy at least $500 billion of long-term
securities.
*Thirty-year bond yields fell six basis points to 3.95 percent.
*Ten-year note yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.6 percent at 2:40 p.m. in New York.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper rose for the second straight day after the
dollar dropped as the Federal Reserve prepared more stimulus
measures to bolster the U.S. economy.
*Copper futures for December delivery gained 4.8 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.833 a pound at 10:01 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Before today, the metal jumped 32 percent since July 1 as
the dollar slumped and metal inventories dropped.  GOLD  New York: Gold prices rose in New York for the third time in
four days on speculation that the Federal Reserve will boost
stimulus measures to spur growth, weakening the dollar and
lifting demand for precious metals.
*Gold futures for December delivery climbed $3.30, or 0.2
percent, to $1,353.90 an ounce at 10:38 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Before today, the metal surged 23 percent this year.  OIL  New York: Crude oil surged to its highest level in six months as
the dollar weakened against major currencies on speculation the
Federal Reserve will inject funds into the U.S. economy.
*Crude for December delivery rose 95 cents to $83.90 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement price
since May 3. Oil has risen 7.4 percent in the past year.  WHAT TO WATCH
