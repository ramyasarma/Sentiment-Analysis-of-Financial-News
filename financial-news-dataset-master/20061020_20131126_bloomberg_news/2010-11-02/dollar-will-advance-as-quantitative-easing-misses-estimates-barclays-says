The dollar will advance versus major
counterparts after the Federal Open Market Committee announces a
smaller increase in asset purchases than many investors expect,
according to Barclays Plc.  The greenback has dropped 9.1 percent versus the euro since
Aug. 27, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech that
the central bank “will do all that it can” to sustain economic
growth, fueling speculation that a resumption of quantitative
easing would debase the dollar.  The Fed will pledge to buy assets of $500 billion or more,
according to 29 of 56 economists in a Bloomberg News survey last
week. Barclays forecasts $60 billion a month for six months.
Policy makers are due to release a statement at 2:15 p.m.
tomorrow after a two-day meeting.  “U.S. data has been improving recently, so it would be a
surprise if the Fed looked beyond it in their statement,”  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at Barclays in New York, said
today in a telephone interview.  The  jobless rate  held at 9.6 percent for a third month,
according to the median of 61 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey before a Nov. 5 report from the Labor Department.
Payrolls likely rose by 60,000 in the first gain since May.  The central bank acquired about $1.75 trillion of
Treasury and mortgage-related debt to sustain the recovery in a
program of quantitative easing that concluded in March.  The dollar dropped today against most of its major
counterparts, depreciating 1 percent to $1.4039 per euro at
12:46 p.m. in New York, from $1.3893 yesterday. The dollar will
end the year at $1.39, according to Barclays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
