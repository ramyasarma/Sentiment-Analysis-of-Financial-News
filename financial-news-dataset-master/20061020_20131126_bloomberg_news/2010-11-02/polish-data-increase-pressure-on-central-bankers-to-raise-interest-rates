Poland’s annual  inflation rate 
probably held steady at a nine-month high in November, the
Finance Ministry said today.  Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent on the year, the same rate
as in October, the Warsaw-based  Finance Ministry  said in an e-
mailed estimate. That matched the median forecast of seven
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Consumer prices probably rose
0.2 percent from October, the ministry said.  The central bank left the  main interest rate  at a record
low of 3.5 percent for a 17th month at the meeting on Nov. 23.
The likelihood of a potential rate increase faded as core
inflation, which excludes food and fuel prices, remained at a
34-month low and council member  Andrzej Bratkowski  said before
the meeting it was “too late” for a preemptive move. He voted
for a 50 basis-point increase at the meeting in August.  Three-month forward-rate agreements, contracts used by
investors to bet on changes in interest rates, dropped to 4.22
percent yesterday from as high as 4.32 on Nov. 12 percent. The
contracts are trading 34 basis points above the three- month
Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate  at 3.88 percent.  The  Central Statistical Office  is due to report the
inflation data on Dec. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
