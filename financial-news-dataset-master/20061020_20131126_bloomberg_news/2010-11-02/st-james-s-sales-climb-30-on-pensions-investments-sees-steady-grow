St. James’s Place Plc , the U.K.
wealth manager majority-owned by Lloyds Banking Group Plc, said
third-quarter sales rose 30 percent on pensions and investment
products.  Revenue climbed to 136.5 million pounds ($219 million) in
the three months to Sept. 30 compared with 104.6 million pounds
a year earlier, the Cirencester, England-based company said in a
statement today. Funds under management increased 10 percent to
24.8 billion pounds.  “Another terrific performance from St. James’s Place with
third-quarter 2010 growth in new business of 30 percent,”
 Eamonn Flanagan , a Liverpool, England-based analyst at Shore
Capital Plc, wrote in a note to clients.  St. James’s Place, which advises clients with more than
30,000 pounds to invest, is seeking to offset the impact of
rising taxes on wealthy Britons by hiring more sales advisers to
boost inflows. The wealth manager, founded by  Jacob Rothschild 
and  Mark Weinberg  in 1991, increased the number of advisory
employees by 3 percent to 1,506 in the first half. Fund inflows
totaled 700 million pounds in the third quarter, the firm said.  The stock dropped 9.1 pence, or 3.3 percent, to 263.9 pence
in London trading.  “While we are up against tougher comparatives in the short
term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver average new
business growth within our 15-20 percent per annum range over
the medium term,” Chief Executive Officer  David Bellamy  said in
the statement.  In July, Bellamy said Lloyds had no intention of reducing
the 60 percent stake in the company it inherited in the purchase
of HBOS Plc in January 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
