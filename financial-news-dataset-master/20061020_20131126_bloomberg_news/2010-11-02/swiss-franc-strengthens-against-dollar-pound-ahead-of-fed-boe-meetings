The Swiss franc strengthened against
the dollar and the pound on speculation the Federal Reserve will
restart asset purchases to bolster the economy and the Bank of
England will signal similar stimulus measures are still under
consideration.  The franc gained against all of its 16 most-active
counterparts. The dollar fell as the Fed began a two-day meeting
analysts forecast will result in policy makers announcing the
purchase of at least $500 billion of long-term debt. The euro
dropped on concern a European Union plan to put burden-sharing
on bondholders during fiscal crises may leave high-deficit
countries struggling to raise funds. The BoE meets on Nov. 4.  “The franc temporarily gets the mantle ‘best major,’”
because others are not doing well, said  Michael Derks , the chief
currency strategist at FXPro Financial Services Ltd., a foreign
exchange trader. “The dollar is lower on expectations of extra
quantitative easing tomorrow, and the pound fell on a sense that
QE is not off the table. As for the euro, some are worrying
about the implications of the crisis-solution mechanism.”  The franc gained 0.5 percent against the euro to 1.3715 as
of 4:35 p.m. in Zurich, after weakening to 1.3834 yesterday, the
lowest since Aug. 10. It appreciated 1.4 percent to 97.83
centimes per dollar compared with 99.17 yesterday. One franc
bought 82.52 yen, a 1.7 percent advance from 81.17 yesterday.  The yield on 10-year Swiss bonds was little changed at 1.5
percent. Swiss government securities returned 4.6 percent this
year, lagging behind German bonds, which handed investors 8.2
percent during the same period, according to Bloomberg and
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies data.  The franc will strengthen to 1.33 per euro by the end of
March next year, according to the median forecast of 32 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
