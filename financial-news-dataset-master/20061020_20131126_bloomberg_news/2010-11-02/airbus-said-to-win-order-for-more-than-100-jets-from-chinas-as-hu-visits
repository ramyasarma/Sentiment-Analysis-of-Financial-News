Airbus SAS, the world’s largest maker
of commercial aircraft, is poised to win a contract from China
for at least 100 jets this week when President  Hu Jintao  visits
France, three people familiar with the talks said.  The accord will likely be announced during a three-day
diplomatic visit that starts this Thursday, said the people, who
declined to be named because the order is still pending.  The order will include both single-aisle and wide-body A330
jets, said one of the people. An order of 100 aircraft would
have a value in excess of $8 billion, making it the largest
since French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  brought home a $17
billion deal from China for 160 jets in 2007.  Airbus aims to close the gap with  Boeing  Co. in China
within two years, after entering the market in 1985 and adding a
local assembly line more than two decades later. While only
three years ago two thirds of large airliners in Chinese fleets
were made by Boeing, Airbus will account of 45 percent of the
total in mainland China by the end of the year, according to
London-based aviation-data company Ascend.  Airbus declined to comment on a possible order
announcement, saying the meeting between Hu Jintao and Sarkozy
at the French presidential palace is a political event and not
the forum for contract negotiations, according to spokesman
 Stefan Schaffrath . Airbus is based in Toulouse, France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
