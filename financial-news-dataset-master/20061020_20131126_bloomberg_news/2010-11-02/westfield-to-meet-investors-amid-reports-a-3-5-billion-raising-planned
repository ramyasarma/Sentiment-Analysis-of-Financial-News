Westfield Group , the world’s largest
owner of shopping malls by market value, said it will meet
investors today in Sydney amid newspaper reports that it plans a
restructuring and capital raising.  Executives from the company will meet with investors
beginning at 10 a.m. in Sydney, Westfield said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Westfield is expected to split its Australian and New
Zealand centers into a separate property trust, which will raise
as much as A$3.5 billion ($3.5 billion) through a capital
raising today, the Australian newspaper reported.  The retailer asked yesterday that its shares be halted from
trading pending an announcement. The cost of protecting
Westfield bonds from default climbed 2 basis points to 132
basis points as of 8:33 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. credit-default swap prices.  The swaps surged 13.2 basis points yesterday, the most
since May 7, prices from data provider CMA show.  The  Sydney-based company , which has so far limited its
business to Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and the U.K., is
looking for new opportunities and will consider expanding into
other markets if conditions are right, Chairman  Frank Lowy  said
in May.  Expansion Plans  The company last week opened its A$1.2 billion Westfield
Sydney shopping mall in the city center, with about 130 stores.
A further 100 stores are expected to open between now and
mid-2011, the company said in an e-mailed statement. It’s also
developing the 1.5 billion pound Stratford City project in
London, which is expected to start operations in September 2011.  Westfield has about A$10 billion of future project
opportunities across its markets, and plans to start as much as
A$1 billion of development work each year after 2010, the
company said at its half-year results presentation on Aug. 18.  Westfield  got about 49 percent of its net operating income
from its Australian shopping centers, 39 percent from the U.S.,
7 percent from New Zealand and 5 percent from the U.K. as of
June 30.  The  shares  rose 1.9 percent to A$12.81 in Sydney trading
yesterday before the halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
