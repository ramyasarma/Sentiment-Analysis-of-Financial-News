Argentine auto sales are poised to
reach a record this year and next even after monthly sales fell
in October from the previous month, the country’s  car dealers
association  said.  Argentine car dealers sold 51,199 units last month,
representing a 20.1 percent decline from September, according to
a statement e-mailed today. Sales rose 28.1 percent from a year
earlier. Dante Alvarez, president of the Buenos Aires-based
association, said the monthly decline was the result of seasonal
fluctuations as consumers delayed car purchases ahead of year-
end.  Vehicle sales in South America’s second-biggest economy,
which the central bank forecast will  expand  about 9 percent this
year, will reach a record 630,000 units in 2010 and will surpass
that level in 2011, Alvarez said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
