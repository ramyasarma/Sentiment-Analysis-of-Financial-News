The judge in Terra Firma Capital
Partners Ltd.’s lawsuit against  Citigroup Inc.  said he may
question a juror over ties to a  Michael Moore  film after
Citigroup claimed that the juror can’t be fair.  The juror, one of nine considering Terra Firma’s $2.2
billion claim against Citigroup, and her husband are among
dozens of people thanked in the credits of “Capitalism: A Love
Story.” U.S. District Judge  Jed Rakoff  said today that the film
appears to be “an extremely one-sided, scurrilous appeal to
anti-bank prejudice.”  The 2009 film explores “the disastrous impact of corporate
dominance on the everyday lives of Americans,” according to
Moore’s website,  michaelmoore.com .  Citigroup lawyer  Ted Wells  this morning asked that the
juror, a New York dancer and performer, be excluded from the
jury, which is scheduled to begin deliberating tomorrow in
federal court in Manhattan.  “Out of nine people, I have one associated with the
Michael Moore movie who’s taking notes like a person
possessed,” Wells said, referring to the beginning of the case,
when Terra Firma was presenting its side. “We started putting
in our case and suddenly we’re seeing a different person,”
Wells said.  Rakoff declined to remove the juror based on the
information provided by Wells. He said he may ask the juror
about her connection to the film.  The case is Terra Firma Investments (GP) 2 Ltd. v.
Citigroup, 09-cv-10459, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
