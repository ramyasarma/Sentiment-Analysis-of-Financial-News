India’s 12-year  bonds  gained the most
in more than two months as the central bank signaled it will
pause Asia’s fastest round of increases in interest rates after
raising them today for a sixth time this year.  Yields on most-traded debt due 2022 fell to the lowest
level since September after  Reserve Bank of India  Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said the probability of further additions to
borrowing costs in the “immediate future is relatively low.”
The monetary authority boosted its  repurchase rate  by a quarter-
point to 6.25 percent and the reverse repurchase rate by a
similar margin to 5.25 percent. Fifteen of 23 economists had
predicted the decision in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The policy is positive for bonds as the RBI hints at
staying put on rates in the near future,”  Deepali Bhargava , a
strategist at ING Groep NV in Mumbai, wrote in a research note
today.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due May 2022 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 8.01 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, declining for a fifth straight day,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price
climbed 0.43, or 43 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.90.  Bonds also advanced as the central bank said it will offer
to buy as much as 120 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) in
government debt at an auction on Nov. 4 to help ease a cash
crunch at banks.  The Reserve Bank will purchase 7.38 percent notes due 2015,
7.02 percent debt maturing in 2016 and 7.80 percent, 10-year
securities at the open-market auction, it said.  The central bank’s bond purchase plan is “supportive for
the markets,”  K. Ramanathan , chief investment officer in Mumbai
at ING Investment Management Pvt., a unit of the largest Dutch
financial services company, said in an e-mailed statement.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
dropped the most since Aug. 24. The rate, a fixed payment made
to receive floating rates, fell 12 basis points to 6.61 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
