The Colts got their third
straight National Football League win and handed a division
rival, the Houston Texans, their ninth straight loss in
Indianapolis.  The Colts, coming off a bye week, won 30-17 at Lucas
Oil Stadium to avenge a 34-24 Week 1 loss to the Texans and
move atop the American Football Conference South Division.  Indianapolis took the lead on its second possession,
midway through the first quarter, when quarterback  Peyton Manning  completed a seven-play, 78-yard drive with a 2-yard
scoring pass that gave  Jacob Tamme  his first NFL touchdown.  “It was good to get this win against a good team, a
team playing with a lot of momentum, but certainly we can
improve on certain aspects of our game,” Manning said in a
televised interview.  It became 14-0 nine seconds into the second quarter
when  Kelvin Hayden  intercepted a pass by Houston
quarterback  Matt Schaub  and returned it 25 yards for
Indianapolis’s first defensive touchdown in 26 regular-
season games.  Manning found  Reggie Wayne  with a 15-yard scoring pass
early in the third quarter to give Indianapolis a 24-3
lead. The Texans responded when  Andre Johnson  caught a 28-
yard scoring pass from Schaub.  Adam Vinatieri  kicked the second of his three field
goals for the Colts to make it 27-10 before  Arian Foster 
closed the deficit to 10 points with 12:26 to play on a 6-
yard scoring run. Foster scored three touchdowns and ran
for 231 yards Sept. 12 in the Texans’ win against the
Colts.  With a 5-2 record, the Colts lead the AFC South over
Tennessee (5-3) and Houston (4-3). Jacksonville is last in
the division with a 4-4 mark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
