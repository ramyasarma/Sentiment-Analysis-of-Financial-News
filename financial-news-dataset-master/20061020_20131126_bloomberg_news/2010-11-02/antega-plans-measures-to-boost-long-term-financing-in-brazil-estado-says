Brazilian Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  will announce measures to stimulate long-term financing
for companies and projects in the coming days, O Estado de S.
Paulo  reported , without saying where it got the information.  The government is studying proposals by several entities,
including Brazil’s Banking Association, the newspaper said,
citing a document it obtained. The document includes proposals
to cut banks’ reserve requirements, tax incentives on long-term
corporate bonds and make regulatory changes to stimulate trading
of those bonds, Estado said.  Luciano Coutinho , the president of the country’s state
development bank, known as BNDES, has discussed the proposals
and the document was presented to Mantega in September, Estado
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
