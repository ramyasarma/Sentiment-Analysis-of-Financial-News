UniCredit SpA and Italy’s state
lender will help fund a 4.1 billion-euro highway project north
of Milan, daily Il Messaggero reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The financing includes a so-called bridge loan and project
financing and will be funded with a bond to be repaid by 2045,
according to the Italian newspaper.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, Banca Popolare di
Milano Scrl and Unione di Banche Italiane ScpA will also help
fund the project, Il Messaggero reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
