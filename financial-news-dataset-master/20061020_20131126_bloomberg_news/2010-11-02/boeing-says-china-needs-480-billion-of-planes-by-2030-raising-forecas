Boeing Co. , the world’s largest
aerospace company, raised its forecast for commercial aircraft
demand in China over 20 years to $480 billion from $400 billion
a year ago as economic growth spurs air travel.  The nation will need 4,330 new planes in the period,
tripling the fleet as increases in personal wealth and
urbanization drive up demand for air travel, according to
 estimates  the Chicago-based planemaker released today in Beijing.  Boeing has said it expects the Asia-Pacific region to need
about 10,320 new aircraft in the period, as Asia surpasses North
America as the world’s biggest aircraft market. North America
will add about 7,200 new airplanes worth $700 billion by 2029,
the company forecasts.  “Finally, we started to see airlines invest in new
planes,” said  Randy Tinseth , marketing vice president at the
jetliner division, said today in Beijing. The company expects to
maintain its 52 percent share of China’s market, he said.  Revenue  from Boeing plane sales in China more than doubled
to $4.89 billion in 2009, making it the fastest-growing region
after the Middle East, where sales surged more than 100 percent
to $5.34 billion. China accounted for about 7 percent of 2009
revenue, while the U.S. made up about 58 percent.  European rival Airbus SAS has made a written proposal to
the Chinese government for the sale of 333 planes, the La
Tribune newspaper reported in September, without saying where it
got the information.  The France-based planemaker began assembling A320 single-
aisle jetliners in Tianjin, China, last year.  Air China Orders  Air China Ltd. , the world’s largest carrier, and Chinese
competitors have  ordered  50 planes from Boeing this year,
according to the aircraft maker’s website.  Investors with Air China approved on Oct. 28 plans to buy
39 Boeing planes and 10 Airbus models to meet rising demand.
Profit at the carrier and rivals China Southern Airlines Co. and
 China Eastern Airlines Corp.  surged in the third quarter as the
yuan strengthened and travel demand rebounded.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Hong Kong’s largest carrier,
said in August it agreed to buy 30 Airbus A350-900 planes and
six Boeing 777-300ERs.  China will probably order a total of 3,272 aircraft with
more than 100 seats in the 20 years ending 2028, trailing only
the U.S., according to an Airbus forecast.  -- Michael Wei . Editors:  Dave McCombs ,  Jonathan Annells   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
