Hog prices climbed for the first time
in five sessions on signs that U.S. pork demand is rebounding.
Cattle futures also rose, halting the longest slump since late
August.  Wholesale pork, known as the cutout, jumped 3.2 percent
yesterday to 76.03 cents a pound, the biggest gain in three
weeks, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The
price fell 17 percent last month. The  dollar  declined as much as
0.9 percent against a basket of major currencies, enhancing the
appeal of U.S. meat exports.  “An abrupt change in the cutout structure with pork up”
boosted futures, said  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. “The outside
markets are very favorable with the dollar turning lower.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1 cent, or 1.5
percent, to settle at 66.2 cents a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Yesterday, the price touched 65.15
cents, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Dec.
31, 2009. The commodity has gained 0.9 percent this year.  The market was “oversold,” Smith said. “We cheapened up
this product quite a bit now.”  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to settle at 98.25 cents a pound. The price dropped in
the previous six sessions. The commodity has gained 14 percent
in 2010.  At midday,  wholesale choice beef  rose 0.7 percent to
$1.6123 a pound, the biggest gain since Oct. 20, USDA data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement climbed 1.45
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $1.1205 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
