SpiceJet Ltd. , the Indian discount
carrier part-owned by billionaire  Kalanithi Maran , will spend
$900 million on buying as many as 30  Bombardier Inc.  aircraft as
it works to more than double its fleet in about three years.  The Q400 turboprop planes are to be delivered from the
second quarter of next year, and will help the airline add
flights to smaller destinations, New Delhi-based SpiceJet said
in a statement today. The carrier also reported a second-quarter
profit compared with a year-earlier loss.  “We believe that the enormous potential in the Indian
domestic market can be further tapped  by enhancing regional
connectivity,”  Neil Mills , who took over as chief executive
officer last month, told reporters in New Delhi today. The
propeller-powered Q400 can carry 70 passengers 2,522 kilometers
(1,567 miles), according to Montreal-based Bombardier’s  website .  SpiceJet has reported four consecutive quarterly profits as
faster economic expansion and rising disposable incomes prompt
more people in India to make long-distance trips by air. The
carrier ordered 30 Boeing Co. 737s in July after investment from
Maran, the founder of Sun TV Network Ltd., helped boost
expansion plans.  Revenue Climbs  The airline posted a net income of 101.1 million rupees
($2.28 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with
a loss of 1.01 billion rupees a year earlier, it said in a
statement. Revenue gained 40 percent to 6.28 billion rupees.
Passenger numbers rose last quarter to 1.53 million from 1.36
million a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  SpiceJet  climbed 6 percent to 88.15 rupees, the highest
closing level since Jan. 17, 2008, at the 3:30 p.m. close of
trade in Mumbai before the carrier announced earnings and the
order. The stock has gained 55 percent this year, compared with
a 17 percent rise in the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive index. Maran bought a 38 percent stake in June from
investors including  Wilbur Ross .  SpiceJet began flying international routes from Oct. 7,
connecting Nepal’s capital Kathmandu to New Delhi and the
southern Indian city of Chennai to Colombo, Sri Lanka. The
carrier operates a fleet of 22 planes, said Mills, who was
previously chief financial officer at FlyDubai.  India’s airline passenger numbers may climb 14 percent to a
record 50 million this year, Boeing Co. forecast in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
