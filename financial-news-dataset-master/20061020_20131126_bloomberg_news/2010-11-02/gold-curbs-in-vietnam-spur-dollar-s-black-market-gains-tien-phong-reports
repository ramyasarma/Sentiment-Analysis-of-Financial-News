The U.S. dollar surged against
Vietnam’s dong in the unofficial market as investors shifted
holdings after curbs on gold trading, the Tien Phong newspaper

market at 1,000 dong higher than at banks because investors
moved to the dollar after a central bank’s instruction to limit
gold trading, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
