Canadian stocks  fell, erasing
earlier gains, after stronger-than-estimated U.S. economic data
weakened gold prices and spurred speculation the U.S. Federal
Reserve will buy fewer assets than forecast to boost growth.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, lost 1.7
percent as the metal slipped 1.9 percent. Copper producer Taseko
Mines Ltd. sank 33 percent as the Canadian government denied its
plans for a mine in British Columbia. Agrium Inc., the country’s
second-largest fertilizer producer, dropped 3.8 percent after
reporting profit 60 percent below the average analyst estimate,
excluding certain items.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  decreased 98.36
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,583.06 as of 11:26 a.m. in Toronto
before a Fed decision on a potential securities-purchasing
program known as quantitative easing.  “Expectations of quantitative easing are becoming less and
less,” said  Marcus Xu , director of equity investments at Genus
Capital Management in Vancouver, which oversees C$1.7 billion
($1.69 billion). “If things are OK, there’s no need to pump so
much money in there and build up future problems with inflation
as well as drive down the U.S. dollar.”  The benchmark climbed 0.1 percent from Oct. 13 to yesterday
as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision on
whether to increase the money supply through asset purchases. A
Fed announcement is scheduled for about 2:15 p.m. in Washington.  U.S. factory orders rose 2.1 percent in September, the
Commerce Department said today in Washington. Economists had
forecast a gain of 1.6 percent, according to the median of 68
economist estimates in a  Bloomberg survey .  ISM Index  The ISM’s  index  of U.S. non-manufacturing businesses
advanced to 54.3 last month from 53.2 in September. The median
forecast for October among 76 economists in a Bloomberg survey
was 53.5. ADP Employer Services said earlier that U.S.
employment rose by 43,000 last month. The median projection in a
Bloomberg survey called for a gain of 20,000.  Gold and silver futures fell the most in two weeks as the
U.S. dollar advanced against most other major currencies.  Barrick lost 2.7 percent to C$48.32. Goldcorp Inc., the
world’s second-largest gold producer by market value, decreased
2.1 percent to C$44.42. Kinross Gold Corp., Canada’s third-
biggest producer, retreated 2.3 percent to C$17.72.  Taseko Mines slumped 33 percent to C$4.38 a day after
Canadian Environment Minister  Jim Prentice  said the government
has refused permission for the Prosperity mine. In July, a
government panel had said the project would harm fish habitat,
navigation and land use by Indian groups.  Gold Buyer  Franco-Nevada Corp., which had agreed to buy 22 percent of
the gold produced at Prosperity, fell 4.8 percent to C$33.84 and
dropped as much as 6.4 percent, the most in nine months.  Agrium fell 3.8 percent to C$84.67 after its third-quarter
profit missed the average analyst estimate by 60 percent,
excluding certain items.  P.J. Juvekar , an analyst at Citigroup
Inc., cut his rating on the shares to “hold” from “buy.”  Construction company Aecon Group Inc. tumbled 9.2 percent
to C$11.03 after its third-quarter earnings excluding certain
items missed the average analyst estimate by 62 percent. The
shares plunged as much as 9.8 percent, the most intraday since
2008.  Twelve of 17 S&P/TSX companies that reported  financial
results  since yesterday’s market close topped the average
earnings estimate of analysts.  Intact, Calfrac  Property and casualty insurer Intact Financial Corp. rose
4.1 percent to C$47.50 after its adjusted third-quarter profit
surpassed the  average analyst estimate  by 38 percent. Oilfield-
services provider Calfrac Well Services Ltd. surged 5.7 percent
to C$27.32 after reporting earnings that beat the average
analyst estimate by 74 percent, excluding certain items.  ShawCor Ltd., which provides products and services to the
energy industry, gained 5.9 percent to C$32.62 after topping its
average analyst profit estimate by 12 percent.  WestJet Airlines Ltd., Canada’s largest airline by market
value, advanced 4.5 percent to a six-month high of C$13.37 after
instituting a quarterly dividend. The company also said it may
buy back as much as 5 percent of its outstanding shares over the
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
