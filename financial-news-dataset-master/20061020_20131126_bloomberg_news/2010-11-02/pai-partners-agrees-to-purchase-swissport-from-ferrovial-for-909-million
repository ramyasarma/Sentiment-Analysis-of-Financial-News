Ferrovial SA  agreed to sell airport
ground-services business Swissport International AG to PAI
Partners Holdings Inc. for 900 million Swiss francs
($909 million) as it divests assets to reduce debt and pay
for other projects.  Ferrovial bought Swissport, which operates in 38 countries,
for 336 million euros ($469 million) in 2005. The Madrid-based
builder expects the transaction with Paris-based buyout firm PAI
to close in December and January, it said today in a statement.
The deal is subject to approval from competition authorities,
and PAI must secure financing, Ferrovial said.  “They will be getting a good price for it and that will be
reflected in Ferrovial’s stock today,” said  Robert Crimes , an
analyst at Credit Suisse in London.  Ferrovial rose  as much as 20 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
8.44 euros in Madrid trading and was up 0.8 percent at 10:03
a.m. The advance extended Ferrovial’s 12-month gain to
25 percent, giving the company a market value of 6.08 billion
euros.  “The proceeds from the Swissport sale will be invested in
new infrastructure and services projects that we consider to
have high potential of value creation,” Ferrovial Chief
Executive Officer  Inigo Meiras  said in the statement.  Ferrovial agreed last month to sell a 10 percent stake in
the 407 Express Toll Route near Toronto for C$894 million
($885 million). On Oct. 22, the Madrid-based builder announced
plans to sell 10 percent of BAA Ltd., the owner of London’s
Heathrow airport, which it bought for 10 billion pounds
($16 billion) in 2006.  PAI Partners manages a leveraged buyout fund valued at
2.7 billion-euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
