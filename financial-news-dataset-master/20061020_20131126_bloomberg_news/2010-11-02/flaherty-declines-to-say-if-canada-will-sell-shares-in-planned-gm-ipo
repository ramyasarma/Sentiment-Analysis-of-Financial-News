Canadian Finance Minister Jim
Flaherty today declined to say if his government plans to sell
any of its stake in General Motors Co. after the auto company
conducts an initial public offering of shares.  Flaherty, speaking to reporters outside Parliament, said
the government has “taken advice” on whether to sell some of
its stake, without elaborating. He added he is glad the
government invested in GM and other automakers, as the
investment helped to save the industry in Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
