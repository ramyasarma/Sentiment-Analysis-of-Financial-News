Australia may produce 23.118 million
metric tons of wheat in the marketing year that began Oct. 1, up
from 22.5 million tons a year earlier, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service said today in a
 report  on its website. The FAS forecast was unchanged from its
previous estimate and compares with an official USDA estimate of
23 million tons, according to the report. Exports will rise to
16 million tons in the marketing year, from 15.249 million, the
FAS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
