The yuan gained, recovering from its
biggest slump in almost two years, on speculation China will
permit appreciation as the recovery in the world’s second-
largest economy gathers pace.  The People’s Bank of China set the reference rate for yuan
trading at 6.6925 per dollar, 0.13 percent stronger than
yesterday’s closing rate of 6.7015. A government-backed survey
yesterday showed China’s  manufacturing  expanded at the fastest
pace in six months in October.  “The yuan still has space for appreciation because of
China’s robust recovery,” said Huang Huawei, a foreign-exchange
trader at Shenzhen Development Bank Co. in Shenzhen. “The yuan
slide that happened yesterday was only accidental.”  The yuan rose 0.11 percent to 6.6928 per dollar as of 9:54
a.m. in Shanghai, after a 0.46 percent drop yesterday, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It has climbed 2
percent since China ended a two-year dollar peg on June 19.  A purchasing managers’ index released by the logistics
federation rose to 54.7 from 53.8 in September, with input
prices climbing the most in six months.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.16 percent
to 6.4608 per dollar, reflecting bets the currency will
strengthen 3.6 percent in one year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Huang said the yuan may rise to 6.5 per dollar by the end
of this year.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
