German Chancellor Angela Merkel
dismissed concerns that a euro-area plan to make investors help
pay for any future debt crisis may drive up the borrowing costs
of high-deficit nations, saying the region must discuss a
permanent financial backstop now.  “Nothing at all in the current shield for the whole euro
area and for Greece will be changed,” Merkel said today in
Brussels at a press conference with Belgian Prime Minister Yves
Leterme. “I don’t see that it shouldn’t be possible to say
where we want to go. What we are doing is talking about the
future.”  European Union leaders agreed last week to create a
permanent debt-crisis mechanism as of 2013 after being forced
six months ago to craft a 110 billion-euro ($154 billion) aid
package for Greece and establish a temporary 750 billion-euro
fund to backstop the euro area as a whole. Those are taxpayer-
financed measures.  Merkel is leading calls in the EU for private bondholders
to help foot the bill for any future sovereign-debt crisis in
the euro area. She persuaded fellow EU government heads last
week to seek a fast-track amendment of the bloc’s governing
treaty to anchor the planned permanent debt-crisis mechanism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
