Holders of Air Berlin Plc’s 2014
convertible bonds should seek better terms in the company’s
proposed buyback, said  Tareen Carmichael  at broker HPC SA.  Germany’s second-largest airline said yesterday it will ask
holders of 125 million euros ($175 million) of 9 percent
convertible bonds to tender their notes in a so-called Dutch
auction. If the company gets more than 80 percent of the
securities it will be able to buy the remainder at face value,
Air Berlin said in a statement.  “This is a very company friendly, very clever offer,”
said Carmichael, who is co-head of convertible bonds at HCP in
London. “Bondholders need to build a blocking position of more
than 20 percent and then negotiate with the company.”  Air Berlin is seeking to take advantage of falling
borrowing costs to refinance the convertibles with as much as
200 million euros of 8.5 percent fixed-rate bonds maturing in
2015. The refinancing will help avoid potential shareholder
dilution of as much as 74 percent if its shares fail to perform
before bondholders can demand early redemption in October 2011.  The bonds, which have traded at an average price of about
104 percent of face value for the past six months, today gained
0.5 cent to 116, having risen 6.5 cents yesterday. The shares
rose as much as 3.84 percent to 3.68 euros and were at 3.67
euros at 10:50 a.m. in Frankfurt.  Air Berlin spokeswoman Yasmin Born wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
