Cadence Pharmaceuticals Inc.  won U.S.
regulators’ approval to sell Ofirmev, the first intravenous form
of the pain medicine acetaminophen.  The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug for
treating mild to moderate pain and reducing fever in adults and
children, Cadence said today in a statement. The product also
may be used to manage moderate to severe pain in combination
with opioid analgesics, a class of medications that includes
codeine, fentanyl and morphine, the company said.  The San Diego-based company purchased the U.S. and Canadian
rights to Ofirmev in 2006 from New York-based  Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. , which sells it in Europe as Perfalgan. An estimated
90 million vials of intravenous acetaminophen were sold in
Europe in 2008, Cadence said on a conference call on Sept. 28.  “IV acetaminophen is the unit market share leader among
all injectable pain medications in Europe,” Chief Executive
Officer  Ted Schroeder  said today in the statement. “With our
planned launch early in the first quarter of 2011, we believe
that Ofirmev will fill a significant gap in the United States
for the treatment of pain and fever in the hospital setting.”  Cadence gained 31 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $9.28 at 5:08
p.m. New York time in extended trading after the close of the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The company’s shares had  declined  7.2
percent this year, as of the 4 p.m. New York time close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
