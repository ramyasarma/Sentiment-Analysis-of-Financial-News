STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. , the
world’s fourth-largest shipyard, led advances among South Korean
shipbuilders in Seoul trading on expectations that growing
global trade will prompt more orders.  STX Offshore  gained 8.1 percent to 28,550 won, the highest
price since August 2008, at the 3 p.m. close of trade in Seoul.
 Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. , the world’s
second-largest shipyard, climbed 3.2 percent to 30,600 won after
winning a $510 million contract.  Global trade is expected to expand 11 percent this year as
consumers in the U.S. and Europe are buying more products from
Asia. Evergreen Group and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., Asia’s two
largest container lines, have ordered 32 new ships from South
Korean shipyards since June.  “Orders, especially for container ships and the offshore
sector, have returned and will probably increase next year,”
said Lee Jae Won, an analyst Tong Yang Securities Inc. in Seoul.
“We’ve come to a point where we may have to start worrying
about undercapacity.”  Daewoo today said it received an order to build an oil and
gas platform from  Chevron Corp.  for $510 million. The structure
will help the oil company increase gas production at an existing
facility in Angola when delivered in the fourth quarter of 2013,
the shipyard said in an e-mailed statement.  STX Offshore will build three ships that can each carry
about 6,500 twenty-foot containers from  Shipping Corp. of India
Ltd. , the Mint newspaper reported yesterday, citing two people
familiar with the plan. The vessels will be worth $80.5 million
each, according to the report.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the world’s largest shipyard,
advanced 2.2 percent to 388,000 won, the highest level since
April 2008. Its unit,  Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. , climbed 3.1
percent to 197,000 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
