Telstra Corp. is seeking an auction
of radio frequency spectrum needed to develop advanced mobile
phone services by 2012, the Australian Financial Review
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The company will today push the Labor government to set a
date for the sale of two spectrum blocks, which is expected to
raise as much as A$1 billion ($999 million), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
