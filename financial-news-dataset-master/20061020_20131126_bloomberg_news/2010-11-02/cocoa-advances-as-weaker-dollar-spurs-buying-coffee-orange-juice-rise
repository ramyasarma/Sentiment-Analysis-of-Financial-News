Cocoa gained for the first time in
six sessions as a weakening dollar boosted the investment appeal
of commodities as an alternative asset. Coffee and orange juice
also gained.  The dollar depreciated versus 12 of its 16 most-traded
peers as the Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting that
analysts expect will result in expanded purchases of government
debt, debasing the U.S. currency. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index headed for the biggest gain in almost two weeks, and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities jumped to
the highest level in two years.  “The weakness in the dollar, the strength in equities, is
causing the macro environment to be supportive of cocoa right
now,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Cocoa for December delivery gained $21, or 0.8 percent, to
$2,780 a metric ton at 10:58 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. In the previous five sessions, the commodity dropped 5.8
percent.  “If the dollar sells off, cocoa could rally close to
$2,900 level,” Klopfenstein said.  Estimates of a cocoa surplus for the 2010-2011 season have
been cut to about 2 million tons from January’s forecast of 3
million to 5 million tons,  Emmanuel Jayet , an analyst at Societe
Generale SA, wrote in a report e-mailed today.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery gained 12
pounds, or 0.7 percent, to 1,854 pounds ($2,968) a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery gained 0.4
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $1.981 a pound in New York. Prices
surged 11 percent last month.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
slipped $3, or 0.2 percent, to $1,925 a ton on Liffe exchange.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 0.8 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $1.592 a pound in New York, rising for the fifth
straight session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
