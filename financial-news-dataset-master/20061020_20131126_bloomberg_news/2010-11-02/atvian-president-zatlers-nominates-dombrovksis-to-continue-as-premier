Latvian President  Valdis Zatlers 
nominated  Valdis Dombrovskis  to return as premier a month after
his Unity party took the most seats in parliamentary elections.  “My proposed candidate is Valdis Dombrovskis” for prime
minister, Zatlers said in parliament today. The government,
which will have 55 seats in the 100-member legislature, may get
a vote of confirmation tomorrow.  Dombrovskis took power as prime minister in March last year
after the previous coalition collapsed and the state was close
to running out of money. His government passed a mid-year
supplementary budget that cut wages and spending to secure the
continued payments from a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.4 billion)
bailout package led by the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  The country, which passed austerity measures equal to about
14 percent of gross domestic product, will have to find as much
as 400 million lati ($788 million) of 2011 budget savings to
bring the deficit down to about 6 percent next year.  “I want to stress that the trust extended by the voters and
the president must be redeemed by tough, hard work,” Zatlers
said today. “The first stage of this difficult task will be the
2011 state budget and the government’s proposals for ensuring
economic growth.”  Unity won 33 seats in the Oct. 2 election, with the Union
of Greens and Farmers garnering 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
