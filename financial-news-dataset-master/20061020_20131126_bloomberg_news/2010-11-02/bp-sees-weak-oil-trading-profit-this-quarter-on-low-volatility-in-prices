BP Plc said it expects oil-trading
profit to stay “weak” during the fourth quarter due to a lack
of price volatility and because refining margins are likely to
decline.  “The supply and trading contribution is expected to remain
weak in the fourth quarter due to continued lack of volatility
in the market,” BP said in its third-quarter earnings statement
today.  The London-based company also expects “a seasonal decline
in refining margins and marketing volumes in the fourth quarter,
which is likely to be exacerbated by high stock levels.”  BP’s refinery maintenance activities are expected to be
higher in the fourth quarter than in the third, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
