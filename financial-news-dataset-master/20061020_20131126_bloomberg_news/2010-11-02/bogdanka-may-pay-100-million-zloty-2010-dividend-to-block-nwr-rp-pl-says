Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA, Poland’s
only publicly traded coal producer, may pay out about half of
its forecast 2010 net income of 201 million zloty ($70.6
million) as a dividend to encourage shareholders not to
cooperate with a takeover bid from New World Resources NV, the
newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported today on its rp.pl website,
without saying where it got the information.  “Bogdanka should pay the dividend because it can afford
to,” the newspaper quoted Marek Sojka, the deputy CEO of the
PTE PZU investment fund that owns 9.8 percent of Bogdanka, as
saying. Sojka added that the dividend payment won’t affect
shareholders’ decision on whether to sell NWR their Bogdanka
shares, as it doesn’t affect the valuation of the company,
according to rp.pl.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
