Och-Ziff Capital Management Group
LLC , the hedge-fund firm run by  Daniel Och , said third-quarter
profit climbed 52 percent as the market recovery boosted assets
and prompted clients to add new money.  Distributable profit, a measure excluding costs related to
Och-Ziff’s 2007 initial public offering, rose to $52.1 million,
or 13 cents a share, from $34.2 million, or 8 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
 Earnings  matched the 13-cent average estimate of nine analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  “We view them as a good beneficiary of the market
volatility going on,” said  Daniel Fannon , a San Francisco-based
analyst at Jefferies & Co. Fannon estimated Och-Ziff would earn
12 cents in the quarter.  Investors deposited a net $2.4 billion this year through
Nov. 1, helping lift assets under management and the fees from
overseeing them. Och, who is trying to reverse a 53 percent
slump in the share price since his firm went public in November
2007, said he expects investors to allocate “significant”
capital to alternative asset managers as the industry is seeing
its first year of net deposits since 2007.  Och-Ziff rose 31 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $15.19 at 1:28
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading. The stock has
gained 11 percent this year.  Clients across the industry committed a net $19 billion of
new capital in the quarter, the most since the end of 2007, as
funds returned to peak asset values from before the global
financial crisis. Industry assets rose by $120 billion to $1.77
trillion, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  Flagship Fund  Och-Ziff’s assets under management have increased 18
percent since the start of the year, to $27.2 billion as of Nov.
1. Performance-related appreciation added $1.7 billion to asset.  Och-Ziff’s distributable earnings don’t comply with
generally accepted accounting principles. The firm reported a
net loss of $93.5 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with a
loss of $80 million, or $1.06, a year earlier. Costs associated
with the IPO will cause net losses through 2012, the Och-Ziff
has said.  The firm reduced its quarterly dividend to 10 cents from 11
cents.  Och-Ziff’s biggest fund, the OZ Master Fund, returned 6.7
percent this year through Oct. 31. The Asia Master Fund advanced
9 percent, the OZ Europe Master Fund climbed 6 percent and the
OZ Global Special Investments Master Fund gained 10.5 percent.  “The investment environment has improved relative to the
first half of 2010,” Och said in the statement.  Och, 49, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, left the
firm in 1994 to start a hedge fund for Ziff Brothers Investments
LLC, which managed the Ziff family’s publishing fortune. He
oversaw money solely for the Ziffs for five years and then
opened his fund to outside investors in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
