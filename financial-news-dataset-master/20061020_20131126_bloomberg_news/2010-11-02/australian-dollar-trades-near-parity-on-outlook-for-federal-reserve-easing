Australia’s dollar climbed to the
highest since 1983 and New Zealand’s currency reached its
strongest in more than two years after the Federal Reserve said
it will pump more money into the U.S. economy, debasing the
world’s main reserve currency.  The South Pacific currencies surged, with the Aussie
erasing earlier losses, after the Fed said it will purchase $600
billion of Treasuries to reduce unemployment and avert deflation
in the U.S.  “Both the Aussie and kiwi are up because of the perceived
continued flow of money into the system, which will continue to
help commodity prices,” said  Carl Forcheski , a director on the
corporate currency sales desk at Societe Generale SA in New
York.  Australia’s currency, called the Aussie, rose as much as
0.4 percent to $1.0037, the highest level since exchange
controls ended in 1983, before trading at $1.0024 at 3:37 p.m.
in New York, up 0.3 percent. The currency gained 1.1 percent to
81.46 yen, from 80.57, and touched 81.54 yen, the highest in
more than three weeks.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.9
percent to 77.82 U.S. cents, from 77.15 yesterday. It touched
78.07 cents, the strongest level since June 2008. The kiwi
bought 63.28 yen, from 62.20, and touched 63.34 yen, the highest
since Aug. 5.  The kiwi gained earlier as the  premium  the nation’s three-
year bonds offer over similar maturity Treasuries widened to
3.65 percentage points, the most since December.  The Aussie surged yesterday after the nation’s central bank
unexpectedly raised the benchmark interest rate to 4.75 percent
and said “the risk of inflation rising again over the medium
term remains.” Demand weakened earlier today after the Bureau
of Statistics said home-building approvals fell 6.6 percent in
September from a month earlier, compared with the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey for no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
