Kosovo Prime Minister  Hashim Thaci ’s
government fell today after parliament approved a no-confidence
vote, triggering early elections.  Sixty-six of the country’s 105 lawmakers approved the
opposition-sponsored motion, Sherif Konjufca, head of media
relations of the legislature in the capital Pristina, said by
phone. Parliament Speaker  Jakup Krasniqi , the acting president,
called the election for Dec. 12, he said, according to Agence
France-Presse.  The collapse of the government increases instability in
Europe’s newest independent country after former President
 Fatmir Sejdiu  quit on Sept. 27 following a court ruling that he
breached the constitution. Prosecutors on July 23 arrested
former central bank Governor  Hashim Rexhepi  after raids on his
office and home in a corruption investigation.  The U.S. is urging European Union countries to work with
Kosovo toward the Balkan country’s integration to the trading
bloc, Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said during a visit to
Pristina on Oct. 13.  Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic
Albanian, unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia
almost nine years after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
drove out the Serb army under leader  Slobodan Milosevic .  The Serbian government has vowed never to accept the
independence of Kosovo, considered the cultural cradle of the
landlocked Balkan country. Twenty-two of the 27 EU member states
have recognized Kosovo’s independence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
