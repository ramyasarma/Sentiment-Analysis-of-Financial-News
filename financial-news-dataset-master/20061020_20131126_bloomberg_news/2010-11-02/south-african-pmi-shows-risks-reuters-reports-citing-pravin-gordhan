South African manufacturing data
shows that the country still faces risks in its economic
recovery, Pravin Gordhan, the country’s finance minister, said
in an interview on the sidelines of a conference in London,
Reuters reported.  “We have always said South Africa is on the road to
recovery but there are all sorts of risks and uncertainties on
the way,” he said, according to Reuters. “The PMI in Kenya
reflects that we are still moving cautiously to the right
area.”  South Africa’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.8
last month from a revised 48.6 in September, Kagiso Securities
Ltd. said yesterday.  The strength of the rand is damaging the economy and
making South African products uncompetitive, Gordhan said,
Reuters reported.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
