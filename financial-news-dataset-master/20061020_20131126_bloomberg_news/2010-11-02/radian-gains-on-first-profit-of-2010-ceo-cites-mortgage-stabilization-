Radian Group Inc . rose the most in
seven months in New York trading, leading a mortgage insurer
rally after posting its first profit in five quarters as claims
costs fell.  Radian , the second-largest U.S. mortgage insurer, surged
$1.11, or 15 percent, to $8.56 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  MGIC Investment Corp. , the biggest
mortgage insurer, advanced 1.3 percent, and No. 3 PMI Group Inc.
climbed 5.4 percent.  Radian’s net income  of $112.2 million, or 84 cents a share,
compares with a loss of $70.5 million, or 86 cents, a year
earlier, when there was less stock outstanding, the insurer said
in a statement today. The provision for losses narrowed to
$344.4 million from $404.9 million in last year’s third quarter.  “We continue to see signs of credit-trend stabilization,”
Chief Executive Officer  S.A. Ibrahim  said in a conference call
after earnings were released. The Philadelphia-based company
benefited from “a decline in the delinquency count for the
third consecutive quarter.”  Delinquencies continued to decline in October, Ibrahim
said. The insurer is seeing “positive results” in new business
across the country, including in Florida. Genworth Financial
Inc. last week said it had higher-than-expected losses from
Florida mortgages.  Outlook for Claims  Radian expects to pay about $420 million in mortgage
insurance claims in the fourth quarter, compared with $494.2
million in the three months ended Sept. 30. Mortgage insurers
pay lenders when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to
recoup costs.  Radian has gained about 17 percent this year and raised
$550 million in a  share sale  in May. The insurer traded for more
than $60 a share in 2006, before the housing slump.  Third-quarter results included a $229.8 million gain from
derivatives, compared with a loss of $30.9 million in the year-
earlier period. The rise was mainly caused by “tightening of
credit spreads within our CDO portfolio,” Ibrahim said on the
call.  MGIC reported in October that the third-quarter loss
narrowed to $51.5 million from $517.8 million on lower default
claims. Walnut Creek, California-based PMI posted a loss of
$281.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
