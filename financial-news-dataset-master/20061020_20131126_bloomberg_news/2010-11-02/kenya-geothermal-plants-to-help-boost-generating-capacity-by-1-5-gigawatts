Kenya Electricity Generating Co. , the
state-owned power producer, will increase its generating
capacity by 1,500 megawatts in the next three years, said
Managing Director  Edward Njoroge .  The additional capacity will be produced from reserves of
geothermal energy and cost about $1.3 billion, Njoroge told a
conference today in Nairobi, the capital. Kenya’s current
capacity of 1,310 megawatts is largely supplied by hydropower
plants.  “We intend to shift the power supply source,” with
geothermal energy providing 50 percent in the future, compared
with the current 11 percent, Njoroge said.  KenGen, as the company is known, is exploring various
financing options such as joint ventures, debt sales and vendor
financing and build and operate contracts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
