BNP Paribas SA , France’s largest
lender, may say third-quarter profit increased, helped by its
consumer-banking networks in France, Belgium and the U.S.  Net income  probably rose to 1.75 billion euros ($2.45
billion) from 1.31 billion euros a year earlier, according to
the average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BNP Paribas, like New York-based JPMorgan & Chase Co., took
advantage of competitors’ woes to make takeovers during the
financial crisis. The Paris-based bank, led by Chief Executive
Officer  Baudouin Prot , became the biggest lender by deposits in
the euro region with the purchase of Fortis’s assets in Belgium
and Luxembourg last year.  The bank is scheduled to release results on Nov. 4 at 7
a.m. Paris time. Prot will hold a press conference call at 8:30
a.m. and the bank’s management will hold an investors’
presentation on its website at 2 p.m.  Below is a table of the estimated third-quarter results.
The figures are in millions of euros. Estimates for net income
ranged from 1.39 billion euros to 2.15 billion euros.
