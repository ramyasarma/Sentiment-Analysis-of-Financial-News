Imperial Tobacco Group Plc , the maker
of Gauloise and Davidoff cigarettes, said full-year earnings
jumped 8 percent as the company raised prices and sold more
economy-brand products.  Operating profit, or revenue minus the cost of sales,
distribution, advertising and other expenses, rose to 2.53
billion pounds ($4 billion) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the
Bristol, England-based company said today in a  statement .
Imperial Tobacco shares gained the  most  in almost a year.  Tobacco companies will have pricing power to increase
revenue as the number of cigarettes sold worldwide rises 2
percent annually in the next five years, market research company
Euromonitor said in September. Imperial Tobacco said it charged
more for cigarettes in the U.K., Germany and other European
markets, while volume for its regional value brand JPS, which
gained market share, rose 13 percent.  “We have a portfolio that is very much aligned to where
the consumer is going in these environments,” said Chief
Executive Officer  Alison Cooper  in an interview with Bloomberg
Television, adding the company may raise prices further.  “The pricing environment remains robust,”  Julian Hardwick , an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said in a
research report today. He expects Imperial Tobacco to meet its
“medium-term” revenue target of 2 percent to 4 percent growth.
Hardwick, who has a “buy”  recommendation  on the stock, said
the shares are undervalued.  Shares Gain  Imperial Tobacco  rose  as much as 3.5 percent to 2,067
pence, the biggest intraday jump since Nov. 10, 2009, and was up
2.2 percent as of 1:20 p.m. in London trading, valuing the
company at 20.8 billion pounds. The stock has gained 4.1 percent
this year, lagging behind the 21 percent jump at larger
competitor  British American Tobacco Plc .  Net income more than doubled to 1.51 billion pounds from
663 million pounds a year earlier. Profit beat the 1.42 billion-
pound average estimates of nine analysts. Earnings in fiscal
2009 were held back by a 660 million-pound loss on financial
hedging, while derivatives in the year through Sept. 30 produced
a 210 million-pound gain.  Price increases and cigarette and fine-cut tobacco sales
helped compensate for a 4.2 percent decline in Imperial
Tobacco’s cigarette volume as economic conditions limited
consumer spending in Spain, the U.S., Russia and Ukraine, the
company said.  Sales  climbed 6.2 percent to 28.2 billion pounds
while net revenue from tobacco increased 3.5 percent to 7.06
billion pounds.  Dividend  Imperial Tobacco plans a full-year  dividend  of 84.3 pence
per share, an increase of 15 percent.  Cost savings since the company’s acquisition in 2008 of
Madrid-based Altadis, the maker of Fortuna cigarettes, have
totaled 300 million euros ($421 million), including 110 million
euros in fiscal 2010, Imperial Tobacco said today. The
manufacturer said it will achieve the takeover’s savings goal of
400 million euros by its September 2012 deadline.  Net  debt  was scaled back by 14 percent to 9.3 billion
pounds last year. Imperial Tobacco’s priority is to pay off debt
from the Altadis purchase, after which acquisitions “are going
to be back in the mix very imminently,” CEO Cooper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
