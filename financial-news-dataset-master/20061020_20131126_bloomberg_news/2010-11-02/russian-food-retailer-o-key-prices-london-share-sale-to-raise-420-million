O’Key Group SA, Russia’s third-
largest food retailer, said its initial public offering raised
$420 million, part of which will fund expansion as the economy
recovers from the steepest contraction on record.  O’Key and existing shareholders sold 38.1 million global
depositary receipts at $11 each, the St. Petersburg-based
company said in a statement distributed on Regulatory News
Services today. The company will receive net proceeds of $161
million to fund expansions and reduce debt, it said.  “It has been a pleasure to receive such a warm welcome
from the financial community in so many geographies,” O’Key
Chief Executive Officer Patrick Longuet, said in the statement.
“We are confident that we have the skills as well as the
capacity to deliver on our strategy for further growth.”  The sale, in the bottom half of O’Key’s $9.90 to $12.90
range, valued the company at $2.95 billion before the start of
trading today. The stock declined 1.2 percent in conditional
trading to $10.87 at 9:05 a.m. London time. Unconditional
trading will begin on Nov. 5.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and VTB Capital, managers for the
sale, could sell a further $42 million of shares in the
overallotment option, given sufficient demand.  O’key boosted sales 21 percent in the first six months of
2010 compared with the same period last year, to 38.3 billion
rubles ($1.2 billion), according to the statement.  X5 Retail Group  and OAO Magnit, Russia’s two largest food
chains, are adding stores and locations to benefit from a
recovery that’s boosting disposable incomes and spending. The
government expects the economy to expand about 4 percent after
last year’s 7.9 percent contraction, the steepest since the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  X5 shares have gained 32 percent this year, while  Magnit ’s
have advanced 67 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
