India’s benchmark stock index fell,
halting a two-day advance, after the central bank raised
interest rates for a sixth time this year to combat inflation
and tightened home-loan rules to slow a property-market rally.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
fell 9.94, or less than 0.1 percent, to 20,345.69 at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge swung between gains and losses
at least 30 times after the central bank said the likelihood of
further monetary policy tightening in the “immediate future is
relatively low.”  DLF Ltd. , the nation’s biggest developer, led declines by
property-related stocks after lending requirements for home
loans were tightened.  ACC Ltd. , the biggest cement maker,
climbed for a second day after its October sales jumped 14
percent.  Tata Motors Ltd. , the biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, retreated to the lowest in more than a week.  “The rate increase was necessary to bring down
inflation,” said  Aneesh Srivastava , the Mumbai-based chief
investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co., who
manages about $325 million in assets. “It’s also a preemptive
step to control inflation rising out of commodity price
increases, which may happen post the expected quantitative
easing in the developed world.” The rate decision hasn’t
changed his investment strategy, Srivastava said.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
closed little changed at 6,119. The  BSE 200 Index  gained 0.2
percent to 2,588.29.  The Reserve Bank of India boosted the repurchase  rate  by a
quarter point to 6.25 percent and the reverse repurchase rate by
a similar margin to 5.25 percent with immediate effect,
according to a statement in Mumbai. Fifteen of 23 economists had
predicted the decision in a Bloomberg News survey.  Housing Development  DLF slid 3.4 percent to 349.2 rupees, its steepest drop
since Aug. 27.  Unitech Ltd. , the second-biggest developer, also
lost 3.4 percent to 86.25 rupees.  Housing Development Finance
Corp. , the biggest mortgage lender, declined 1.1 percent to
702.8 rupees. Tata Motors, maker of the world’s cheapest car,
the Nano, fell 1.4 percent to 1,154.25 rupees.  Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. , the largest maker of sport-utility vehicles and
tractors, lost 1.2 percent to 757.6 rupees.  Commercial banks will have to increase the so-called risk
weighting on home loans of 7.5 million rupees and above to 125
percent, the central bank said in a statement in Mumbai today.
The previous risk weighting ranged from 75 percent to 100
percent, the bank said.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao’s move comes as counterparts in
nations from Japan to the U.S. are considering additional
monetary stimulus, increasing the risk of an influx of capital
into India that might exacerbate inflation. The yield advantage
of Indian 10-year government bonds over similar maturities of
U.S. Treasuries is hovering near a decade high.  “The Reserve Bank has done a good job,” said  Deven Choksey , chief executive officer at K.R. Choksey Shares &
Securities Pvt., which manages about $125 million in equities.
“They’ve allowed liquidity to prevail, but at the same time
they’ve raised rates to counter inflationary pressures.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve has a policy meeting later today
and tomorrow that may herald a new round of monetary easing to
bolster the world’s largest economy, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Australia’s central bank today
unexpectedly increased its benchmark interest rate by a quarter
percentage point. The Bank of Japan is set to meet Nov. 4-5.  Best Performer  The Sensex has climbed 17 percent this year amid record
purchases by foreign funds, making the gauge the best performer
among the world’s 10 largest stock markets. Overseas  investors 
bought a net 9.64 billion rupees ($216 million) of Indian
equities on Oct. 29, extending this year’s inflows to 1.14
trillion rupees, according to data on the  website  of the
Securities and Exchange Board of India.  ACC jumped 4.7 percent to 1,061.85 rupees, its highest
level since December 2007.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the largest
engineering company, rose 2.4 percent to 2,133.2 rupees, its
highest close since January 2008.  Tata Steel Ltd. , the biggest
producer of the alloy, climbed 1.2 percent to 599.05 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
