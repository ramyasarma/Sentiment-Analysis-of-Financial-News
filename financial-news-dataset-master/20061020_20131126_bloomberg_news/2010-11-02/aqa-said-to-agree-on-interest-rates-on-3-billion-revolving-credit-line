Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, agreed to terms on $3 billion
of credit lines, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  Lenders will get an interest rate of 130 basis points more
than benchmarks on a $1 billion five-year revolving credit and a
margin of 100 basis points on a $2 billion three-year revolver,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the deal
is private. Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again
once it’s been repaid. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., BNP Paribas SA,
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and Standard Chartered Plc started marketing the loan to a
wider group of banks, the company said yesterday in a statement.  The proceeds will refinance a $3.15 billion facility
maturing next year, according to the statement.  Allan Virtanen, an Amsterdam-based spokesman for Taqa,
declined to comment on the terms of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
