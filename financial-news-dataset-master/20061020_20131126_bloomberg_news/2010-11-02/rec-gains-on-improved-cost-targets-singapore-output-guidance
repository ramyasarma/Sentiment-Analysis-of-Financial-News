Renewable Energy Corp. ASA , the
Norwegian maker of solar energy components, rose in Oslo trading
after it predicted “industry leading” production costs next
year and forecast rising output.  REC  climbed  as much 6.1 percent to 21.75 kroner, the
steepest gain since Sept. 9, and traded at 21.5 kroner as of
2:30 p.m. in Oslo, valuing the company at 21 billion kroner
($3.6 billion). The stocks are down 43 percent this year  “They gave a good cost target and production guidance for
2011 was strong -- more so than expected,” said  Tomas Skeivys ,
an analyst at Terra Markets ASA with a “buy” recommendation on
the stock, who said he would raise his target price.  The company said today it targets a full production cost at
its Singapore plant of 97 euro cents ($1.36) a watt by the
fourth quarter of next year, when including materials from its
U.S. plant, down from about 1.49 euros a watt in the third
quarter. Excluding depreciation, the cash cost target will be an
“industry leading” 74 cents a watt, according to presentation.  The company targets raising module production in Singapore
to 800 megawatts by 2012, exceeding “nameplate” capacity by
about 35 percent. REC expects polysilicon production to rise 23
percent to about 16,000 tons and silane gas output to climb 16
percent to about 2,150 tons next year. Norwegian wafer
production is expected to rise 38 percent, while module output
may rise to 650 megawatts from about 490 megawatts.  Full Integration  “REC is uniquely positioned in the solar industry with
full integration of the entire photovoltaic value chain from
polysilicon to modules,” the company said. “With the new,
integrated wafer, cell and module production facility in
Singapore, REC is set to achieve a cost competitive position
through the entire value chain from polysilicon to modules.”  The company has  struggled  amid increased competition from
China, cuts in state support for solar energy in Germany and
Spain and as it invested in plants. REC spent 25 billion kroner
expanding polysilicon and wafer production at plants in the U.S.
and Singapore, in a program that experienced setbacks and proved
to be “too much for the organization,” Chief Executive Officer
 Ole Enger  said in March.  “What is important for us is that China is opening up for
solar energy -- whether it’s locally produced or imported comes
second to that,” Enger said in an interview in Singapore today.
“We mustn’t forget that the major, major part of this market is
still Europe. Europe will still be dominant in 2011 and 2012.”  The company expects capital expenditures of 1.3 billion
kroner to 1.5 billion kroner in 2011, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
