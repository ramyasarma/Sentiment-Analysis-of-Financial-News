French trade-union protests that
blocked refineries and oil terminals are set to cost oil
companies between 200 million euros ($279 million) and 300
million euros, Les Echos reported, citing the country’s main
industry body.  As refinery employees return to work and the leftist CGT
union lifts its 33-day blockade on the Fos-Lavera port
terminals, the final cost of the disruption is yet to be
determined, the French newspaper said.  Jean-Louis Schilansky, head of the French Oil Industry
Union representing  Total SA  and other companies, said the
preliminary estimate reflected costs for keeping tankers moored
offshore, maintaining refineries on standby and establishing new
gasoline supply routes to avoid shortages, Les Echos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
