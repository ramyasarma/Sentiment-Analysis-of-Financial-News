A Yemeni teenager went on trial for
killing a French contractor at the local office of Austria’s  OMV
AG , and denied charges he carried out the assault following the
directives of a militant cleric.  Yemen’s state security court today said Hisham Mohammed
Asem, 19, a security guard at OMV, had e-mail correspondence
with Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric who supports
violence against U.S. targets.  The contractor killed last month worked for Spie
Batignolles SA, a French construction company, according to the
French foreign ministry. Another British contractor was injured
in the attack.  Yemen put al-Awlaki on trial in absentia today on charges
of incitement to murder foreigners, citing the OMV attack. Al-
Awlaki is believed by the U.S. to have links with al-Qaeda
militants including three of the people who carried out the
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S., Yemen’s state-owned news
agency Saba reported today. It said al-Awlaki will be tried in
Yemen if he’s captured, not extradited to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
