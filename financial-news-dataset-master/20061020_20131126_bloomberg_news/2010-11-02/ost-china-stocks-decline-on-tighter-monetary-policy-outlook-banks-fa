China’s stocks  fell from a six-month
high on concern recent gains were excessive given the prospect
the government may join India and Australia in tightening
monetary policy to curb inflation.  China Shenhua Energy Co. and China Coal Energy Co., the
nation’s two largest coal producers, slid more than 1 percent.
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Huaxia Bank Co. paced
declines for lenders after China Business News said the
government may cut the money supply next year.  China Shipping
Development Co. , a unit of the second-biggest sea-cargo group,
rose to the highest in six months after Essence Securities Co.
recommended the stock on higher shipping rates.  “Liquidity will be ample on a global perspective and that
will keep equity prices at least at the current level,” said
 Dai Ming , a fund manager at Shanghai Kingsun Investment
Management & Consulting Co. “But domestic monetary policy is
uncertain and will probably be normalized further next year.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, declined for the fifth time in six days,
losing 8.59, or 0.3 percent, to 3,045.43 at the 3 p.m. close.
The  CSI 300 Index  slid 0.3 percent to 3,463.13.  China’s stocks will be “range-bound” this month, as some
investors are likely to sell shares amid the rally, according to
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. The Shanghai Composite, which
surged 12 percent last month to top major global stock indexes,
will trade between 2,900 and 3,150 in November, analysts led by
 Yuan Yi  at the brokerage wrote in a report today.  Coal Valuations  A gauge of energy producers slid 2.1 percent, the second-
most among the 10 industry groups in the CSI 300. The measure
has gained 32 percent over the past month, pushing up price
earnings to 20.7 times, up from 16.2 at the beginning of October.  China Shenhua, the nation’s largest coal producer, lost 3
percent to 28.67 yuan, narrowing a 21 percent gain over the past
month. Rival China Coal Energy slid 1.5 percent to 12.88 yuan.  The Shanghai gauge remains down 7.1 percent this year after
the government raised bank reserve requirements and curbed
lending growth to avert asset bubbles. It has rebounded 30
percent since reaching this year’s low on July 5 on expectations
central banks around the world will inject more cash into their
economies to boost growth.  Agricultural Bank of China slipped 0.4 percent to 2.77 yuan.
Huaxia Bank, partly owned by Deutsche Bank AG, sank 1.4 percent
to 12.77 yuan.  China may cut its M2 money supply target to 15 percent or
16 percent next year, from 17 percent, China Business News
reported today, citing an unidentified person. The government is
considering changing to a “sound” monetary policy from a
“moderately loose” one next year, the newspaper reported.  Debt Purchases  Australia and India raised interest rates today before
central bank meetings in the U.S. and Japan this week. The
Reserve Bank of Australia unexpectedly increased its benchmark
rate on concern stronger economic growth will fuel inflation,
while India’s central bank raised borrowing costs for a sixth
time this year.  The Federal Reserve will probably begin a new round of
unconventional monetary easing this week by announcing a plan to
buy at least $500 billion of long-term securities, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Policy makers meeting Nov. 2-3 will restart a program of
securities purchases to spur growth, reduce unemployment and
increase inflation, said 53 of 56 economists surveyed last week.
Twenty-nine estimated the Fed will pledge to buy $500 billion or
more, while another seven predicted $50 billion to $100 billion
in monthly purchases without a specified total. The remainder
said the Fed would buy up to $500 billion or didn’t quantify
their forecast.  China Inflation  China’s inflation rate may rise to around 4 percent in
October and will resume climbing next year even if it moderates
at the end of 2010, Barclays Plc said yesterday. The government,
which boosted borrowing costs for the first time last month in
three years, has set a full-year inflation target of 3 percent.  Air China Ltd., the nation’s largest international carrier,
paced a retreat for airlines, falling 4.5 percent to 15.31 yuan.
China Southern Airlines Co., the nation’s biggest carrier by
fleet size, lost 4.5 percent to 11.56 yuan.  Citigroup Inc. raised its year-end estimates for China’s
stock measures to reflect the “strong momentum” of a
liquidity-driven rally, according to analysts led by  Minggao Shen  in a report.  The brokerage boosted its target for the Shanghai A-Share
Stock Price Index to between 3,300 and 3,500, compared with the
previous estimate of 2,800 to 3,100. The CSI 300 may rally to
3,600 to 3,800 by the end of the year, from the previous
estimate of 2,900 to 3,100.  China Shipping surged 7.4 percent to 12.61 yuan, the
highest since April 16. Essence Securities recommended buying
the stock, saying its valuation is lower than rivals and rising
demand for coal will boost shipping rates, analyst Wu Li wrote
in a note. China’s coastal shipping rates last week jumped 26
percent from the previous week as cold weather spurred coal
demand, Wu said.  -- Zhang Shidong . Editor:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
