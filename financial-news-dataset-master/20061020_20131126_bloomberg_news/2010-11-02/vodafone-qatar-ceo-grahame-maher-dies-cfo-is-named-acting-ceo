Vodafone Qatar,  a venture between
 Vodafone Group Plc  and state-controlled Qatar Foundation, said
its Chief Executive Officer  Grahame Maher  died. He was 51.  Chief Financial Officer  John Tombleson  will be the acting
chief executive, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Australia-born Maher died of a heart attack, a company
spokeswoman said. He led Vodafone Qatar since 2008, managing the
company through a $1 billion initial public offering and the
rollout of service to the public last year. The company, which
achieved a customer base of 600,000 in September out of a
population of about 1.6 million, became the first domestic
competitor to  Qatar Telecom QSC.   “Grahame himself made a difference to the lives of
everyone he touched,” the company said. “He was a great CEO,
coach, mentor, and friend. We will all sorely miss his
inspiration and vision, his passion and energy, and his love for
all the people he worked with.”  Maher is survived by his wife Jenny and daughters Jessica
and Kate, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
