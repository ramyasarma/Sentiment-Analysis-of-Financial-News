Traders may use the combination of
U.S. election results and a Japanese holiday to push the dollar
below 80 yen, according to CMC Markets.  “Early poll results of U.S. mid-term elections will hit a
quieter-than-usual Asian Wednesday session as Japan is shut for
a holiday,”  Ashraf Laidi , chief market strategist at CMC
Markets in London, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “This
runs the risk of traders attacking the 80-yen figure on election
volatility, especially after dollar-yen ended October at a new
all time monthly low.”  The dollar gained 0.3 percent to 80.72 yen as of 2:15 p.m.
in London, after slumping yesterday to 80.22 yen, the weakest
level since April 1995. The Dollar Index lost 0.7 percent to
76.740.  To contact the reporter on this story:
