Dell Inc. , the world’s third-largest
maker of personal computers, agreed to buy software company
Boomi to expand its Web-based computing services.  Boomi’s programs help companies manage and integrate cloud
computing -- which delivers software and stores data via the
Internet -- with their existing applications and databases.
Financial terms of the transaction weren’t disclosed, Dell said
today in a statement.  Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, is trying to reduce its
dependence on PC sales and build its computer-services business
through  acquisitions . It bought services-provider Perot Systems
Corp. last year for about $3.9 billion, its biggest purchase,
and lost out to Hewlett-Packard Co. in September in a bidding
war for storage provider 3Par Inc.  Boomi’s software-as-a-service applications transfer data
between Internet-based and on-site programs. The company is
based in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.  Dell rose 2 cents to $14.43 at 12:54 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading . The shares are little changed this
year.  In the third quarter, Dell ranked third in the global PC
market, based on shipments, according to Gartner Inc. Dell
trailed HP and Acer Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
