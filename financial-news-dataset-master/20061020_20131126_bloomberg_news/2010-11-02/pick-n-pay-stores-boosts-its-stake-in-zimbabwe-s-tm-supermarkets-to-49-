Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. , South
Africa’s second-largest grocer, increased its stake in
Zimbabwe’s TM Supermarkets to 49 percent, the company said.  The purchase of a 24 percent stake for $13 million must
still be approved by Zimbabwe’s regulatory authorities and South
Africa’s central bank, the Cape Town-based company said today in
a stock-exchange filing. The deal is expected to be completed by
the end of March, it said. Some outlets will be re-branded as
Pick n Pay stores.  TM Supermarkets is controlled by  Meikles Ltd. , which also
owns Zimbabwe’s biggest tea grower and maker, luxury hotels and
department stores. It vies with  Delta Corp. -controlled  OK Ltd. 
to be Zimbabwe’s biggest supermarket chain.  Zimbabwe aims to double the size of its economy by 2015 as
it recovers from a decade of recession, Dezve Sibanda, the
country’s economic planning secretary, said on Sept. 16.
Foreign investment outside the mining industry has been slow to
materialize because of political uncertainty over black
empowerment laws, Harare-based economist John Robertson said by
phone from Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
