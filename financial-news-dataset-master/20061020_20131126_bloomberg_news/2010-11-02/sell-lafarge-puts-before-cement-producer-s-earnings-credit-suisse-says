Investors should sell bearish  Lafarge
SA  options because the world’s biggest cement maker may rally
and prices for the derivatives may fall after its Nov. 5
earnings report, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Equity derivatives strategist  Daniel Roy  recommended that
investors buy a December 44 call while selling a December 48
call, a spread strategy that cuts the cost of the transaction
while capping potential profit, before the report. He suggested
selling December 40 euro puts to help finance the trade. Lafarge
fell 0.2 percent to 41.46 euros yesterday in Paris.  “We expect Lafarge’s  implied volatility  to ease by a few
points post-release” the London-based strategist wrote. The
stock also may rally along with the economic recovery in
emerging markets because the company bought Orascom Construction
Industries in 2008 to expand its presence in the developing
world, he said.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days has fallen to 35.44 from
this year’s peak of 48.43 in May.  Lafarge has slumped 28 percent this year, while Holcim, its
next-biggest rival, lost 22 percent. That compares with a 8.4
percent drop for the Stoxx 600 Construction & Materials Index.  Credit Suisse analysts have an “outperform” rating on
Paris-based Lafarge, while they rate Jona, Switzerland-based
Holcim at “underperform.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
