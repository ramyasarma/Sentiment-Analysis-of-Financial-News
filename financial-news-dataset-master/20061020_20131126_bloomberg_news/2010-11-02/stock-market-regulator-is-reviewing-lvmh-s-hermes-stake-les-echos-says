The French stock market regulator is
still reviewing LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA’s purchase
of a 17.1 percent stake in Hermes International SCA, Les Echos
said, citing the watchdog’s president Jean-Pierre Jouyet.  “We’re currently checking that all the rules were
respected, given that Hermes shares have been under surveillance
for several months,” Jouyet said, according to the French daily
newspaper.  The regulatory process for companies increasing their
holdings “isn’t as precise and wide-ranging as I’d like,” Les
Echos cited Jouyet as saying. It is “regrettable” that a 2008
recommendation to include financial instruments such as equity
swaps when calculating shareholdings wasn’t passed into law, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
