  Hochtief AG , Germany’s largest
construction company, reiterated a profit  forecast  for 2010
after its Australian unit reported a reduction to earnings.  Profit before and after taxes will exceed last year’s
levels, and the company remains committed to earning 1 billion
euros before taxes “in the medium term,” Hochtief said in a
statement today. Hochtief fell as much as 2.6 percent in
Frankfurt trading.  Leighton Holdings Ltd ., Australia’s biggest construction
company,  today plunged  the most in almost six months in Sydney
trading after delays and increased costs at the A$4 billion ($4
billion) Airport Link project in Brisbane, the strength of the
local currency and reduced earnings from a rail project shaved
A$85 million off its first-quarter profit.  Essen, Germany-based Hochtief owns 54.47 percent of
Leighton. The company is seeking to repel a takeover approach by
its largest shareholder, Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
SA, and has appealed to Australia’s takeover panel to force the
Spanish company into a cash bid for Leighton.  Leighton is Hochtief’s most prized asset, with its holding
valued almost as highly as the entire company. ACS owns close to
30 percent of Hochtief, and aims to raise its stake to just over
50 percent.  Hochtief is scheduled to release detailed earnings on Nov.
11. Before today, the shares had gained 15 percent in value this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
