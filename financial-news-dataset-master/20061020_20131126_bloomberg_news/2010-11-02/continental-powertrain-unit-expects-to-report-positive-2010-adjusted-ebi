Continental AG , Europe’s second-
biggest auto-parts maker, said it’s one year ahead of a profit
target for its powertrain and interior divisions as global car
sales advances outweigh development costs.  The powertrain unit’s earnings before interest, taxes and
one-time items will be positive this year, one year earlier than
originally planned, spokesman  Hannes Boekhoff  said, citing
comments made by Chief Executive Officer  Elmar Degenhart . The
interior unit will have a “significantly positive” adjusted
Ebit in 2010, he said.  Continental’s interior unit will reach an adjusted Ebit
margin in early 2012 of 7 percent to 8 percent, while the
powertrain unit will reach that target in 2013, Boekhoff said.  The Hanover, Germany-based supplier’s spending on the
development of electric propulsion systems and turbochargers
left the powertrain unit unprofitable since Continental bought
Siemens AG’s VDO car-parts unit in 2007. The divisional profits
would help the company in repaying about 8 billion euros in debt
as it moves closer to merging with 75 percent  stakeholder 
Schaeffler Group.  The revised targets were first reported by Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung today. Continental is scheduled to report
third-quarter earnings tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
