Wheat rose in Chicago on concern that
the crop in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, may
deteriorate because of dry weather.  December-delivery wheat gained 1.2 percent to $7.1075 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:05 p.m. Paris time
after reaching $7.11. The grain has surged 31 percent this year
on tightening global supplies.  The winter-wheat crop deteriorated in the week to Oct. 31
from a week earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
yesterday. Growing areas in the southern plains were predicted
to receive below-normal rainfall in the seven days from
yesterday, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a forecast.  “Dryness continues to threaten U.S. winter wheat,” wrote
 Chung Yang Ker , an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, in a note
today. “With that week-to-week decline in the condition rating
and continued concerns about weather, wheat may post gains.”  About 46 percent of  winter wheat  was in good or excellent
condition as of Oct. 31, down from 47 percent in the prior week
and compared with 64 percent a year earlier, the USDA said.
About 92 percent of the crop was planted in 18 states, compared
with 88 percent the previous week and 81 percent a year ago.  The 18 U.S. producing states tracked in the report were
forecast to account for 89 percent of the country’s winter-wheat
acreage this year, according to the USDA.  ‘Very Dry’  “The weather conditions remain very dry in the U.S. and
continue to hinder the coming up of the autumn sowings,” Paris-
based farm adviser Agritel said on its website. “The crop
rating deteriorated again.”  January-delivery milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 1.1 percent to the day’s high of 223.75 euros
($312.93) a metric ton.  “French origins seem a little more expensive than American
origins, but still benefit from a differential in freight
costs,” Agritel said.  December-delivery corn added 0.7 percent to $5.815 a bushel
in Chicago. The harvest in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower,
may be 12.523 billion bushels this year, commodity research and
brokerage company FCStone Group Inc. said yesterday, lowering an
estimate issued in September.  FCStone’s latest forecast compares with the USDA’s Oct. 8
forecast for corn production of 12.664 billion bushels and last
year’s record crop of 13.11 billion bushels.  Corn Harvesting  “The figures are bullish, modestly, for corn,” economist
 Dennis Gartman  said in his daily newsletter.  About 91 percent of the  corn crop  was harvested as of
yesterday, up from 83 percent a week earlier and the previous
five-year average of 61 percent, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said yesterday.  January-delivery soybeans gained 0.3 percent to $12.39 a
bushel. The U.S. crop will reach 3.449 billion bushels, FCStone
said. The USDA last month predicted 3.408 billion bushels, up
from last year’s record 3.359 billion bushels.  About 96 percent of the  soybean  harvest was collected, up
from 91 percent a week earlier and the five-year average of 79
percent, the USDA said yesterday.  The department will release its fourth survey-based
estimate of U.S. crops on Nov. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
