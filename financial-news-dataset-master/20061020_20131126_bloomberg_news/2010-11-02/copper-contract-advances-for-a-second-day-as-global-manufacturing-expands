Copper climbed for a second day as
manufacturing in China, the U.S. and the U.K. accelerated in
October, boosting confidence that the global economic recovery
is intact.  The metal for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 0.3 percent to $8,324 a metric ton, and
traded at $8,315 a ton by 9:07 a.m. Singapore time.  Copper on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 0.3
percent to 63,500 yuan a ton, while December-delivery metal on
the Comex in New York was little changed at $3.7820 a pound.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
