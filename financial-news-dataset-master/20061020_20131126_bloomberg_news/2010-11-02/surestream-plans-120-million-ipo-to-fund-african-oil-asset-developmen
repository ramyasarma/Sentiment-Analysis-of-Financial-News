Surestream Petroleum Ltd. , a U.K.
energy explorer, plans to raise about $120 million in an initial
public offering on London’s Alternative Investment Market next
year to develop assets in Africa.  Surestream appointed NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd. as its
financial adviser, the Reading-based company’s Chief Executive
Officer, Christopher Pitman, said in an interview in Cape Town
today. He couldn’t provide details of the assets as they’re
related to licenses the company expects to be awarded “soon.”  Africa, which supplies about 11 percent of the world’s oil
and has 9 percent to 10 percent of proven reserves, is set to
rise in importance as an oil producer, PricewaterhouseCoopers
said in September in a report. The continent will probably
surpass North America in 2011 to become the third-largest
producing area after the Middle East and Central and Eastern
Europe, PricewaterhouseCoopers said.  Surestream is owned by its four founders, a U.S.-based
investment company, a Norwegian investment company and a few
individuals, according to its website. The company is exploring
in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
