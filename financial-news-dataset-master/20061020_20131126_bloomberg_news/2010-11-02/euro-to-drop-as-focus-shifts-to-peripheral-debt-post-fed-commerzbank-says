The euro may drop against the dollar
as investors shift their focus to European countries’ budget
deficits after the Federal Reserve decides this week whether to
expand asset purchases under its quantitative easing plan,
according to Commerzbank AG.  While investors “question the long-term sustainability of
the peripheral countries’ budgets,” such “fundamental concepts
as this are hardly going to be relevant while the issue of
quantitative easing II is still dominating the markets,” a team
of analysts led by  Ulrich Leuchtmann  in Frankfurt wrote in a
research note today. “But afterwards these issues might begin
to put pressure,” on the euro, they wrote.  The euro may decline to $1.35 by the end of next month,
they wrote. Europe’s common currency climbed 0.5 percent to
$1.3962 as of 10:20 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
