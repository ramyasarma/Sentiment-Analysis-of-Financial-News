Nouriel Roubini, the New York
University professor who predicted the global economic crisis,
said U.S. house prices have further to fall.  The European Union faces problems because it may lose
competitiveness and the debt problems in Greece, Spain, Ireland
and Portugal are yet to be resolved, he said at a conference in
Cape Town today. Austerity measures in those countries may crimp
growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
