Russia’s RTS stock exchange plans to
sell shares in an initial public offering next year to raise
funds for expansion in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.  The size of the listing is yet to be determined and “at
the moment, consultations with underwriters are being held,”
said Rufina Baybulatova, a Moscow-based RTS spokeswoman, in an
e-mailed reply to questions from Bloomberg News.  “The majority of global exchanges have conducted or are
conducting IPOs,” said Chief Executive Officer  Roman Goryunov 
in a separate e-mailed statement. “This is one of the factors
that emphasizes the maturity and high level of the stock market
development.”  Poland sold a majority stake in the Warsaw Stock Exchange
in a 1.2 billion-zloty ($420 million) IPO last week.  The decision to list publicly is a “logical step” in the
exchange’s development, and is a “procedure that most global
exchanges undertake,” said Baybulatova.  The size of the listing is yet to be determined and “at
the moment, consultations with underwriters are being held,”
Baybulatova said.  The exchange’s shareholders include Troika Dialog and
Renaissance Capital among domestic banks and international banks
including Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc.  The RTS climbed 0.5 percent to 1,607.54 by 4:45 p.m. in
Moscow in its fourth day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
