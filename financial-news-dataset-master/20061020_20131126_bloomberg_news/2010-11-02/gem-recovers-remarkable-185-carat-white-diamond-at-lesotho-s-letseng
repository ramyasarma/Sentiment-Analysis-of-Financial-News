Gem Diamonds Ltd., a miner of the
precious stones in Lesotho, said it recovered a “remarkable”
185-carat white rough diamond from the country’s Letseng mine.
The company’s shares surged in London trading.  “Early examinations indicate that this rough diamond will
yield top color and top clarity polished diamonds and is thus
expected to achieve a substantial price per carat,” Chief
Executive Officer  Clifford Elphick  said today in statement.  Gem Diamonds, based in London, recovered a 196 carat
diamond from the same mine this year. That rough stone may be
worth as much as $11.8 million,  Alison Turner , an analyst at
Panmure Gordon and Co., wrote in a report on Sept. 7. Gem
Diamonds holds 70 percent of Letseng and the remainder is owned
by the government of Lesotho.  Miners at Letseng have uncovered three of the 20-biggest
diamonds recovered since 2006, Gem Diamonds said.  The company  rose  11 percent, the most since May 10, to
228.25 pence by the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
