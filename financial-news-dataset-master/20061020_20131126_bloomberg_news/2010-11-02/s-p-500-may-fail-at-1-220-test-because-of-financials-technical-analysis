Financial companies may prevent the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  from breaking through its April high
of 1,220, according to  Carter Worth , the third-ranked technical
analyst in last year’s Institutional Investor survey.  The S&P 500 Financials Index tracking 81 companies dropped
below its average during the previous 150 days on May 18 for the
first time in three months and has since failed in five attempts
to overcome the threshold, which Worth uses to gauge a bull or
bear market. The industry ranks second in weightings among the S&P
500’s 10 groups after technology, contributing 15 percent.  “The sector is literally ‘stuck,’ is at a standstill,”
Worth, chief market technical at Oppenheimer & Co., wrote in an
e-mail message to Bloomberg News. “The market is unlikely to
eclipse its April highs without the financials coming to life.”  Financial shares were the only losing group in the S&P 500
during the past three months as concern rose that banks face
more losses from bad mortgages. The Financials index fell 1.1
percent, compared with a 7.5 percent gain in the S&P 500.  Worth’s view set him apart from analysts who say a pickup
in market momentum will help the S&P 500 extend the best
September and October performance in 12 years. The benchmark for
U.S. equities has  rallied  13 percent since the end of August and
is 3 percent away from its 2010  intraday  high of 1,219.80.  Buy Signal  Katie Stockton of MKM Partners said the resistance will
“ultimately be surmounted,” citing a buy signal flagged by the
weekly  Moving Average convergence/Divergence  chart since
September and the rise in the S&P 500’s cumulative advance-
decline line.  “There are no negative divergences to suggest the rally is
tiring from a long-term perspective,” Stockton, chief market
technician at MKM Partners, wrote in a note to clients on Oct.
31. “Momentum is positive from an intermediate-term
perspective, which dictates a bullish bias into year-end.”  Carter disagrees, saying financials hold the key for the S&P
500.  “Now there are those who would and will argue that
equities can keep on advancing even as the second-biggest sector
by market capitalization does not advance,” he wrote in a note
to clients. “But we’ll take the other side of that bet.”  To contact the reporter on this story;
