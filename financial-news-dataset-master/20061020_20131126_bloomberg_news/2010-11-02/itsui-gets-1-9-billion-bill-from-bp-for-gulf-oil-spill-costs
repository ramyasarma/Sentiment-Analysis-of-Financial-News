Mitsui & Co. ’s oil exploration
unit received a $1.9 billion bill from BP for costs involved
in cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, the biggest
offshore oil spill in U.S. history.  Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. , which has a 10 percent stake
in the damaged Macondo oil well, received the invoice for
costs through to today, the company said in a  statement  on
its website. Mitsui Oil is withholding payment to London-
based BP, the statement said.  “Given there are numerous ongoing investigations to
determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the
incident” and there is “uncertainty” whether Mitsui Oil is
liable, the Tokyo-based company said.  The company assumes that costs for the cleanup
represented by its 10 percent interest in the well were about
$1 billion through the end of Sept. it said. Japan’s second-
biggest trading house owns 70 percent of Mitsui Oil.  Mitsui & Co.’s net income more than doubled to 183.2
billion yen ($2.3 billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30
from a year earlier because of higher iron ore and oil prices,
the company said today in a statement.  Sales rose 6.1 percent to 4.9 trillion yen. The company
maintained its forecast for full-year profit of 320 billion
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
