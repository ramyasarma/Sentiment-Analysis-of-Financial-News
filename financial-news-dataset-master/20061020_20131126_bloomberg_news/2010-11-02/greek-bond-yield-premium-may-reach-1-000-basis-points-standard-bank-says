The extra yield investors demand to
hold Greek government bonds instead of benchmark German bunds
may reach 1,000 basis points before the end of the year,
Standard Bank Plc said.  “Germany’s plans for burden-sharing in the event of a euro
zone default and the re-statement of the no-bailout law present
challenges to the debt market,”  Steve Barrow , head of research
for Group-of-10 currencies, said today in a research note. “We
suspect that 10-year Greek spread over Germany will scale 1,000
basis points and Ireland 500 basis points, probably before the
end of the year.”  The Greek-German  yield spread  widened 19 basis points to
841 basis points at 10:29 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
