Investors should buy VIX puts because
the benchmark measure of U.S. options prices will probably fall
should today’s elections and tomorrow’s Federal Reserve
announcement meet expectations, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said.  Chances that Democrats will lose the U.S. House are 95
percent, according to bets placed on Intrade, a Dublin-based
online prediction market. The Fed will probably begin a new
round of unconventional monetary easing by announcing a plan to
buy at least $500 billion of long-term securities, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Derivatives strategists  Krag “Buzz” Gregory  and  David Park  recommended buying December 21 puts on the  VIX , or Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The gauge fell 1.2
percent to close at 21.57, snapping a six-day streak of
advances, the longest since January 2008. The index measures the
cost of using  options  as insurance against declines in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which rose 0.8 percent.  “Risk metrics in the S&P 500 options market are down
dramatically, pointing to a less anxious investor community,”
the New York-based strategists wrote in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
