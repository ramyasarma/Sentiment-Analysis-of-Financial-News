Corn and soybean futures fell for a
second straight day as wet weather improved prospects for early
crop development in Brazil and Argentina, the two biggest
exporters after the U.S.  As much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of rain the past four
days and more in the forecast the next 10 days will improve soil
moisture in Brazil and Argentina, said  Don Keeney , a senior
agricultural meteorologist for MDA Information Systems Inc. in
Rockville, Maryland. Dry areas have shrunk to less than 10
percent in Brazil and 20 percent in Argentina, down from 50
percent a month earlier, Keeney said.  “Traders are taking a little bit of the weather premium
out of the corn and soybean markets,” said  Chad Henderson , a
market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin. “There are no pressing crop problems in
South America.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close $5.7575 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, capping the first two-day drop since Oct. 22.
Yesterday, the price reached $5.9075, the highest level since
August 2008. Corn has gained 54 percent since the end of June as
adverse weather reduced U.S. production.  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at $12.34 a bushel in Chicago. On Oct. 28, the
commodity reached $12.4875, the highest price for a most-active
contract since September 2008. Soybeans have risen 37 percent
since the end of June on increased demand for U.S. supplies from
China, the biggest global buyer.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter of both
crops. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans at $31.8
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
