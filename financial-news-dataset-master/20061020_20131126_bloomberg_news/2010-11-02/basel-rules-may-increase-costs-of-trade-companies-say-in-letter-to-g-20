Companies may face higher costs and
reduced financial support when exporting or importing goods as a
result of reforms to bank capital rules, a coalition of business
associations warned today.  The reforms will harm global trade and economic growth by
increasing the amount of capital that banks must hold when they
provide trade finance, the associations, which include the
Institute of International Finance, and the National Foreign
Trade Council, said in a letter to the Group of 20 countries.  “Policies which put at risk the affordable trade of
essential goods and adversely impact import/export business and
emerging markets work at cross-purposes with the G-20 economic
goals,” the letter said.  The G-20 has asked the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision to reform capital rules for banks to ensure that
they can’t build up excessive levels of risk on their balance
sheets. Banks say that some reforms proposed by the Basel
committee will add to what they see as already too high capital
charges on trade finance, making it less attractive for them to
provide it.  Trade finance consists of short-term loans and guarantees
provided by banks to companies to support import and export
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
