(Corrects bank name in fifth paragraph.)  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc sold
448.6 million euros ($623 million) of seven-year structured
notes that switch from fixed payments to floating rates.  The securities pay a coupon of 4.2 percent in the first
year, and then switch to a payment based on the level of the
six-month euro interbank offered rate, or  Euribor , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds were marketed to investors
in Italy.  “While quite vanilla, this is still one of the more exotic
payoffs in Italy this year,” said  Denis Beltramini , an
executive director of structured product sales at RBS in London.  Noteholders receive 4.1 percent if Euribor is above 1.5
percent in years two and three, above 2.1 percent in years four
and five, and more than 2.8 percent in the final two years.
Otherwise investors get Euribor plus 0.5 percentage points. Six-
month Euribor, an average of rates set daily by banks and used
as a borrowing benchmark, is 1.269 percent.  The notes were issued through  Banco Popolare SC  and include
distribution fees of 4 percent, according to the term sheet.
Investors receive their capital back at maturity.  RBS is the fifth-biggest issuer of structured notes in
Europe this year, with $3.7 billion of sales, according to
Bloomberg data that excludes equity-linked products. This is its
biggest issue this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
