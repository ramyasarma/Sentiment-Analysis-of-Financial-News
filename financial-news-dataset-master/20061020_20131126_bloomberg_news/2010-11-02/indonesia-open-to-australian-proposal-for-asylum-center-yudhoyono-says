Indonesia’s government is “open” to
an Australian proposal to build a processing center for asylum
seekers to reduce people-smuggling and human-trafficking in the
region, President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  said.  “We need to ensure that the regional processing center is
the proper way,” Yudhoyono said after a meeting with Australian
Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  in Jakarta today. “Indonesia is
open to that, but we have to discuss this in depth.”  Gillard’s Labor government wants to build an offshore
processing center for asylum seekers trying to reach the nation
from Southeast Asia, as the number of detainees in Australia
passes 5,000, and had talks with East Timor last month about
setting up a detention center in that country.  Australia and East Timor plan to complete a proposal on the
processing center by “early 2011,” Immigration Minister Chris
Bowen told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio on Oct 13.  “We need to be working with countries of origin, countries
of transit and countries of destination,” Gillard said today.
“Our dialogue is able to comprehend all of those matters.”  Australia’s policy of mandatory detention of illegal
immigrants started in 1992 and Gillard, who formed a minority
government after the Aug. 21 election, vowed during her campaign
to continue that practice and house refugees offshore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
