U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index ending near its highest levels of the day,
after the Federal Reserve’s announcement of $600 billion of
Treasury purchases sent banks higher.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Fifth Third Bancorp and Bank of
America Corp. advanced at least 1.1 percent to help lead gains
among lenders.  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  climbed
9.2 percent after lifting its earnings estimate this year.  Ford
Motor Co.  rose 5.2 percent after saying sales increased 15
percent in October.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 1,197.96 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, the highest since May 3. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average added 26.41 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,215.13, its
highest close since the week Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed
for bankruptcy in September 2008.  “Some people were expecting $500 billion, some thought
it’d be spread out over a year,” said  James Swanson , chief
investment strategist at Boston-based MFS Investment Management,
which oversees about $204 billion. “So it was slightly positive
for the markets and for the economy.”  After fluctuating most of the day, stocks rose after the
Fed said new purchases will be about $75 billion a month through
June. Policy makers said they will “adjust the program as
needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.”
The majority of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected the
Fed would add at least $500 billion to the financial system.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is trying to boost growth
after near-zero interest rates and $1.7 trillion in securities
purchases helped pull the economy out of recession without
bringing down unemployment from close to a 26-year high.  ‘Step-By-Step’  “I would like to see the Federal Reserve articulate step-
by-step what adding $600 billion in additional securities to
their balance sheet accomplishes and how,”  Michael Aronstein ,
president of Marketfield Asset Management, said during a
Bloomberg Television interview on “Street Smart” with  Carol Massar  and  Matt Miller . “I understand what they did in the
fourth quarter of 2008, which saved the global economy from a
real meltdown, but as far as incrementally adding reserves at
this point, I’m just not certain how that works.”  The S&P 500 has surged 17 percent since July 2 as odds
increased that Republicans would take control of the U.S. House
of Representatives. The party, while falling short of winning
the Senate, narrowed the chamber’s Democratic majority yesterday
in an election shaped by voter anxiety over jobs and the
economy.  60-Seat Gain  Republicans gained at least 60 House seats across the
country, capitalizing on concern that government spending has
increased over the last two years and delivering a rebuke to the
domestic agenda of President  Barack Obama .  The S&P 500 may rally as much as 16 percent in the next six
months because the election will stymie legislative initiatives
in Congress, billionaire investor  Kenneth Fisher  said.  “Markets don’t like big sweeping actions,” said Fisher,
who oversees more than $38 billion at Woodside, California-based
Fisher Investments Inc. “Right now, every politician is
chirping and burping and carrying on. It’s been in the interest
of the Republicans running for office to talk down the economy.
That goes away immediately after the election. Come June, you’ll
see how quiet the political landscape will be -- very little
legislation and a lot of baby kissing.”  Better-Than-Estimated Data  Separate reports today showed U.S. service industries,
private payrolls and factory orders grew more than forecast.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 54.3 in October, topping the median forecast of
76 economists in a Bloomberg News survey for a rise to 53.5.  Data from ADP Employer Services showed employment increased
by 43,000 last month, above the median estimate of a 20,000
gain. A government jobs report in two days may show the
unemployment rate held steady at 9.6 percent in October as the
economy added 60,000 jobs. Orders placed with  factories  climbed
2.1 percent in September, the most since January, the Commerce
Department said. That compared with a forecast of a 1.6 percent
gain.  JPMorgan added 2.1 percent to $37.72, leading financial
shares to the  biggest  gain among 10 groups in the S&P 500.
Hartford Financial jumped $2.15 to $25.57 after reporting its
biggest profit since 2007 on investment gains and boosting its
2010 earnings forecast.  A gauge of auto-related companies rose 3.9 percent, the
biggest gain among 24 S&P 500 industries.  Increased Sales  Ford  climbed 5.2 percent to $15.18, a six-year high. The
world’s most profitable automaker and General Motors Co.
reported U.S. sales increases that topped analysts’ estimates
and said October was the best month this year as consumers
returned to showrooms.
      AMR Corp.  rallied 6.6 percent to $8.37 after climbing to
$8.38, the highest intraday price since June 21. American
Airlines parent company is a “top pick” among U.S. carriers,
Jamie Baker, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst said, adding the
company will “turn a significant margin corner” in 2011.  BlackRock Inc. fell 4.3 percent to $165.66. The world’s
largest asset-management firm said Bank of America Corp. and PNC
Financial Services Group Inc., two of its biggest shareholders,
plan to sell 42 million shares.  EOG Resources Inc. fell 9.3 percent to $88.64. The crude
oil and natural gas company lowered production growth estimates
for 2010, 2011 and 2012,  Jeff Dietert , an analyst at Simmons &
Co. in Houston, said in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
