Brazilian President Luiz Inacio  Lula da Silva  asked President-elect  Dilma Rousseff  to keep Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  and central bank President  Henrique Meirelles  in their current posts, O Estado de S. Paulo reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Lula wants Rousseff to keep Meirelles as head of the
central bank for at least six months, the newspaper said.
Meirelles may also be considered as a minister or head of a
state-controlled company, Estado said, citing government
officials it didn’t identify.  Luciano Coutinho , head of the state development bank, known
as BNDES, may be chosen as central bank president or finance
minister or may remain in his current post, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
