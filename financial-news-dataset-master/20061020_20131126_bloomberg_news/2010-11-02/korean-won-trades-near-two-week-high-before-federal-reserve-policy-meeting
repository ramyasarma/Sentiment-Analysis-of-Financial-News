South Korea’s won traded near a two-
week high on speculation the Federal Reserve will step up asset
purchases, boosting the supply of U.S. dollars.  The won has gained 8.5 percent versus the greenback since
June, the best performance among Asia’s emerging-market
currencies, as near-zero interest rates in the U.S. spurred
demand for higher-yielding assets. The Fed bought $1.7 trillion
of debt from December 2008 through March to help end a recession
in the U.S. and economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict at
least another $500 billion of so-called quantitative easing will
be announced when a two-day policy meeting concludes tomorrow.  “The focus of the market is on quantitative easing,” said
 Sung Jae Man , a currency analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc in
Seoul. “But the market is uncertain about what the Fed will do,
so we’re not seeing a big move in the currency.”  The won traded at 1,116.55 per dollar as of 10:07 a.m. in
Seoul, little changed from 1116.58 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 1,115.25, the
strongest level since Oct. 19.  The Fed will this week restart a program of securities
purchases to spur growth, reduce unemployment and increase
inflation, said 53 of 56 economists surveyed last week by
Bloomberg. Twenty-nine estimated the Fed will pledge to
buy $500 billion or more, while another seven predicted $50
billion to $100 billion in monthly purchases without a specified
total. The remainder said the Fed would buy up to $500 billion
or didn’t quantify their forecast.  Bonds Decline  U.S. policy makers may limit the amount of easing as it
risks being criticized by world economies for stoking inflation,
Sung said. Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations agreed
last month in South Korea to refrain from “competitive
devaluation” and to let markets set exchange rates more.  South Korean government bonds fell for a third day, sliding
after government data yesterday showed inflation accelerated to
a 20-month high of 4.1 percent in October. The yield on the 3.75
percent note due June 2013 rose three basis points to 3.38
percent, the highest level since September, according to Korea
Stock Exchange. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
