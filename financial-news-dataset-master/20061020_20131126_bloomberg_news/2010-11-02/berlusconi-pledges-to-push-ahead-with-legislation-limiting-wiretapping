Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi said he’d push ahead with a law that limits police
wiretapping during criminal investigations, setting up a clash
with a group of lawmakers that left his party in July.  The extent of wiretapping in Italy is “uncivilized,”
Berlusconi said in a speech to motorcycle makers near Milan.  Gianfranco Fini, the leader of a splinter group that left
Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party three months ago, opposes
the measure and has enough votes to sink the government. Fini
said in August that the rule of law should come before
individual privacy, and parliament suspended voting on the bill.  Berlusconi’s comments were broadcast live on Sky TG24
television.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
