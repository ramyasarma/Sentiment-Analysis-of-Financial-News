K+S AG , Europe’s biggest potash
producer, reported a jump in third-quarter profit and raised its
target for 2010 after prices for the crop nutrient gained.  Earnings before interest and taxes, referred to by the
company as EBIT I, rose to 108.5 million euros ($152 million)
from 9.4 million euros a year earlier, Kassel, Germany-based K+S
said today. Sales advanced 35 percent to 1.06 billion euros.
Analysts predicted 972 million euros, according to a Bloomberg
survey.  K+S pushed through three price increases to European
customers this year. Farmers are replenishing nutrients in the
soil after reducing applications of potash over the past two
years. Earnings also got a lift after K+S became the world’s No.
1 salt producer with the purchase of Morton Salt from  Dow 
Chemical Co. a year ago.  “Conditions on global fertilizer markets have improved
continuously and significantly since the beginning of the
year,” the company said in a statement today. “Salt markets in
western Europe and in North and South America prove to be stable
on a high level.”  Earnings before interest and taxes will rise to 630 million
euros to 670 million euros this year, up from an earlier
forecast of 550 million euros to 600 million euros, the company
said.  K+S, which is scheduled to issue a full earnings report on
Nov. 11, rose 2.1 percent to 51.09 euros in Frankfurt trading as
of 4:38 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
