Britain is to allow prison inmates to
vote in elections, bowing to a six-year-old ruling from the
European Court of Human Rights.  “There is a need to change the law,” Cabinet Office
minister  Mark Harper  told Parliament in London today. “This
isn’t a choice, it’s a legal obligation. Ministers are currently
looking at how to implement the judgment.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  decided to lift the 140-year-
old ban after being advised that failing to comply with the
European ruling could leave the government open to legal
challenge and compensation claims. In 2004, the Strasbourg-based
ECHR ruled the ban was unlawful following a challenge from
prisoner John Hirst.  Cameron wants to exclude convicts jailed from the most
serious crimes, serial killers and murderers from voting in
elections, the BBC reported without saying where it got the
information. Inmates would be allowed to vote in the electoral
district they last lived in rather than the one where the prison
is located to avoid skewing results, the Daily Telegraph
reported.  “It is a matter of great concern to the public,” said
 Sadiq Khan , who speaks on justice affairs for the opposition
Labour Party. The ruling “opens the door for serious offenders
to be given the vote.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
