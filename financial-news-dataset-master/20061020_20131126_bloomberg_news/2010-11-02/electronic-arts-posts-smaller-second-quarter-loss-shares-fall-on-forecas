Electronic Arts Inc. , the second-
largest U.S. video-game publisher, reported a narrower second-
quarter loss. The company forecast profit this quarter below
analysts’ estimates after moving the release date of a title.  The net loss narrowed to $201 million, or 61 cents a share,
from a loss of $391 million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier,
Redwood City, California-based Electronic Arts said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, profit was 10 cents a share in
the period ended Sept. 30, beating the average 11-cent loss
 estimated  by 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Electronic Arts moved up the U.S. release of “2010 FIFA
World Cup South Africa,” boosting results in the second quarter
at the expense of the third, Chief Financial Officer  Eric Brown 
said in an interview. This quarter, Electronic Arts projects
profit minus some items will be 50 cents to 60 cents, below the
69-cent average estimate of 21  analysts .  Sales will be $1.39 billion to $1.5 billion, compared with
estimates averaging $1.43 billion, the company said.  Electronic Arts lost 45 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $15.75 in
extended trading. The shares rose 40 cents to $16.20 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  and have declined
8.7 percent this year.  Second-quarter sales, excluding changes in deferred
revenue, totaled $884 million, exceeding of the average estimate
of $811.6 million.  The shares fell 6 percent on Oct. 12 after “Medal of
Honor” received a composite review score of 75 on the website
Metacritic.com. The first-person shooter title faces competition
from Microsoft Corp.’s “Halo: Reach” and the Nov. 9 release of
“Call of Duty: Black Ops” from Activision Blizzard Inc., the
largest publisher.  “Medal of Honor” has sold 4 million copies and is
exceeding the company’s expectations, Brown said.  Electronic Arts’ ability to meet or exceed its full-year
outlook will come down to execution of holiday releases
including “Dead Space 2,” “Crysis 2,” “Dragon Age 2,” and
“Bulletstorm,”  Jess Lubert , an analyst with Wells Fargo
Securities, said in a note to investors before the release. He
has a “market perform” rating on the stock.  The company earlier today said it agreed to use the
Facebook Credits payment system exclusively on its games on
Facebook Inc.’s site. The publisher has increased its focus on
social games, buying publisher Playfish last year.  (Electronic Arts will host a conference call to discuss
