Harley-Davidson Inc.  will open an
assembly plant in India next year, its second outside of the
U.S., as economic growth stokes demand for luxury motorcycles.  The plant in the northern state of Haryana will make models
including Sportsters using kits imported from the U.S., Harley,
the largest U.S. motorcycle maker, said in a statement today. It
didn’t say how much the new facility would cost.  Harley began India sales earlier this year, gaining an edge
on Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s Motorrad unit, which is set to
enter the market by December. Nationwide motorcycle sales will
grow as much as 12 percent annually over the next three years,
 Ravi Sud , chief financial officer of Hero Honda Motors Ltd., the
largest domestic motorcycle maker, said on Aug. 23.  “India’s rapidly growing economy, rising middle class and
significant investment in construction of new roads and highways
are paving the way for leisure motorcycle riding,” Chief
Operating Officer  Matthew S. Levatich  said in the statement.  The Milwaukee-based company opened an assembly plant in
Brazil in 1999, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
