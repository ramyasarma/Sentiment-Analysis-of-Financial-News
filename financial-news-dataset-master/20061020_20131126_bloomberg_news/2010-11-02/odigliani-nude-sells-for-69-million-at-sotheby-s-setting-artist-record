An  Amedeo Modigliani  1917 nude sold
for $68.96 million, a record for the artist, helping  Sotheby’s 
reach its highest total for a New York Impressionist and modern
art sale since May 2008.  The auction tallied $227.6 million with commissions, below
Sotheby’s top estimate of $266 million, which doesn’t include
the buyers’ premiums. That reflected a sober mood in the room
brimming with cautious dealers and collectors. A quarter of the
offerings failed to sell, including works by  Francis Picabia ,
 Joan Miro  and  Henri Matisse .  “The sale was strong in areas, and weak where it should
be,” said London dealer  Alan Hobart  of Pyms Gallery, who bought
Henri Matisse’s bronze “Deux Negresses,” for $8.5 million on
behalf of a client.  Modigliani’s “Nu Assis sur un Divan (La Belle Romaine)”
was offered early in the 61-lot sale, the first of the two-week
New York autumn season. Five phone bidders vied for the work,
described in the catalog as a “post-coital rendering.”  “It really set a benchmark,” said dealer  David Nash  of
Mitchell-Innes & Nash. The artist’s previous record was set in
June when a limestone bust went for $53 million, blasting past
its $7 million estimate.  The sale provided further evidence of fine art’s recovery
since the credit crisis. Yesterday, Sotheby’s  shares  rose $1.88
to $45.12, the highest closing price in almost three years. The
New York-based auctioneer is scheduled to report third-quarter
 earnings  tomorrow.  Coveted Nudes  Modigliani nudes are especially coveted. “La Belle
Romaine” has an almond-eyed model, head cocked seductively and
torso wrapped in white drapery that reveals more than it
obscures.  It previously sold at Sotheby’s in 1999 for $16.8 million.
The seller then was a member of the Sultan of Brunei’s family,
dealers said. Last night it was estimated to fetch about $40
million.  The artist’s last major nude at auction was sold by Las
Vegas billionaire  Steve Wynn  in 2003 at  Christie’s International 
for $26.9 million.  Last night’s sale also saw a pair of paintings offered to
benefit nonprofit organization  YoungArts , established by the
late billionaire  Ted Arison . Dealers said the seller was his
wife, Marilyn.  One of the works,  Claude Monet ’s 1917-1919 verdant water
lilies painting, fetched $24.7 million. The Arisons acquired the
work for $9.9 million in 1998 at Sotheby’s.  Long-Necked Muse  Dealers said Arison also sold Modigliani’s 1917 “ Jeanne Hebuterne  (Au Chapeau),” a portrait of the artist’s famed long-
necked muse, tagged to fetch up to $12 million. It went for $19
million. The Arisons acquired the painting in 1996 at auction
for $3.5 million.  Henri Matisse ’s flirty 1942 portrait of an Italian countess
decked out in a blue tutu, “Danseuse dans le fauteuil, sol en
damier,” fetched $20.8 million. The work had appeared twice at
auction at Sotheby’s in London in the past decade, fetching $7.5
million in 2000 and $21.7 million in 2007.  Another Matisse, the 1934 portrait of model Titine Trovato
that failed to sell at Sotheby’s in November, 2008, against an
estimate of $18 million, was offered again last night with a
lower estimate of $8 million. It didn’t get a single bid.  Impressionist and modern sales resume tonight at
Christie’s with an 85-lot sale slated to total from $199 million
to $287 million. Sotheby’s charges buyers 25 percent of the
hammer price up to $50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1
million, and 12 percent above $1 million.  To contact the reporters on the story:
