European  stocks climbed as the U.S.
Federal Reserve began its two-day meeting to decide how it will
support the economic recovery.  BP Plc gained 1.8 percent after the international oil
company beat analysts’ profit estimates. BG Group Plc, the
U.K.’s third-largest natural-gas producer, jumped 3.4 percent
after saying profit rose in the third quarter. K+S AG rallied
1.6 percent after Europe’s largest potash producer raised its
earnings forecast for 2010.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  added 0.4 percent to 267.5 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London as more than two stocks rose for
every one that fell. Tomorrow, the Fed will start a fresh round
of bond purchases to boost growth, a tactic known as
quantitative easing, by announcing a plan to buy at least $500
billion of long-term securities, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The results from BP and BG Group are forcing investors
out of their shells a bit today when otherwise they would have
sat on the sidelines waiting for the move from the Fed
tomorrow,” said  Joshua Raymond , a markets strategist at City
Index Ltd. in London.  Fed policy makers meeting today and tomorrow will restart a
program of securities purchases to spur growth, reduce
unemployment and increase inflation, said 53 of 56 economists
surveyed last week. Twenty-nine forecast that the Fed will
pledge to buy $500 billion or more, while another seven
predicted the bank will buy $50 billion to $100 billion in
monthly purchases without specifying a total. The remainder said
the Fed would buy as much as $500 billion or they didn’t
quantify their estimates.  U.S. Elections  In today’s U.S. mid-term elections, the Republicans are
poised to retake the House and narrow the Democrats’ margin in
the Senate, rebuking President  Barack Obama ’s party in a
campaign shaped by voter anxiety over jobs and the economy.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 17 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index  advanced 1.1

$4.6 billion, according to the mean of 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  BG Group, Fresenius  BG , the U.K.’s third-largest natural-gas producer, jumped
3.4 percent to 1,252 pence after it posted third-quarter profit
that rose 12 percent on higher domestic gas prices.  Fresenius AG , the owner of the world’s biggest provider of
kidney dialysis, advanced 2.6 percent to 64.89 euros after
saying it expects net income for 2010 to rise 20 percent.  K+S  rallied 1.6 percent to 50.85 euros after the potash
producer reported a surge in profit and raised its 2010 target
after the price of the crop nutrient gained.  Earnings before interest and taxes surged to 108.5 million

products, tumbled 4.5 percent to 11.04 euros after The Deal
reported that U.S. antitrust regulators will seek to block the
company’s purchase of Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings Corp.  The Federal Trade Commission is preparing a lawsuit to halt
the $3.68 billion purchase, The Deal reported, citing a
Washington antitrust lawyer familiar with the agency’s
investigation.  Mitchell Katz , a spokesman for the commission,
declined to comment. Both companies said they had no knowledge
of any FTC plans to block the transaction.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  sank 3.2 percent to 67.4 pence as
Britain’s biggest mortgage lender forecast “good” results in
2010 without providing any figures, prompting calls for the
government-controlled bank to match the financial reports of its
peers.  Of the 157 companies in the  Stoxx 600  that have announced
