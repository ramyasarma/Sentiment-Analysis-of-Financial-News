Australia will spend A$500 million
over the next five years to build or upgrade as many as 2,000
schools across Indonesia, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in
an e-mailed statement today after talks with President Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono in Jakarta yesterday.  The two countries will also start negotiations on an
economic partnership agreement to expand trade and investment,
Gillard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
