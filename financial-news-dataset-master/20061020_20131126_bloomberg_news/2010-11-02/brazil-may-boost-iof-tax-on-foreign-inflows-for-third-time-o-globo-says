Brazil’s government may raise the tax
it charges foreigners on some investments for the third time
since the beginning of October, O Globo reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  In addition to raising the so-called IOF tax, President-
elect  Dilma Rousseff ’s transition team is also considering
changing bank reserve requirements and taking anti-dumping
measures, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said. The
government is also planning steps to stimulate long-term
lending, O Globo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
