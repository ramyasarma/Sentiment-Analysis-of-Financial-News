Speculation that the Bank of England
will expand asset purchases in a new stage of quantitative-
easing measures, dubbed QE2 by traders, is “misplaced,” and
investors should sell gilts, Nomura International Plc said.  “Perceptions that QE2 could extend to the U.K. were
misplaced and we feel that the recent data run has supported
that view,” a team of analysts led by  Nick Firoozye  in London
wrote in a research report today. Investors should maintain
“underweight” positions in U.K.  government bonds , the analysts
said, meaning they should own fewer bonds than the indexes that
they use to benchmark performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
