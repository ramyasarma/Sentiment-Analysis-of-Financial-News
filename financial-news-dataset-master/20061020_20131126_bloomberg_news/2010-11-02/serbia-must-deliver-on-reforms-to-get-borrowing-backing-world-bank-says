Serbia needs to make progress on a
set of reforms before the  World Bank  will back the country’s
planned $400 million borrowing abroad with its guarantee in
2011, the lender said.  Serbia asked the World Bank to help it raise as much as
$400 million with a guarantee of $100 million, Loup Brefort, the
World Bank’s resident representative in Serbia, said in an
interview in Belgrade today.  Serbia  will need to speed up reforms including adopting a
new company law and make more progress on eliminating outdated
regulation, Brefort said. A decision on the loan guarantee may
come as early as late January, he added.  “Our target is still early in 2011,” Brefort said.  The World Bank is “confident” that Serbia’s economy will
keep recovering and that it may next year beat the 1.5 percent
growth expected for 2010, he said. Rising unemployment and
accelerating inflation are the two main points of concern,
according to Brefort. Fiscal policy is still too expansionary
and a pension reform is “absolutely essential,” he also said.  Under its 3 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) loan program with
the International Monetary Fund and because of its own fiscal
rules, Serbia needs to cut spending on pensions to 10 percent of
GDP from more than 13 percent. The IMF has also said the country
should spend more on capital investment, allow more space for
privately-owned businesses to grow and improve law enforcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
