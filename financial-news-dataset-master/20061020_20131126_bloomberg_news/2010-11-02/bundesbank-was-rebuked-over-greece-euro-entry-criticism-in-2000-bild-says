Germany’s finance minister sought to
silence a Bundesbank critic of Greece’s bid to join the euro
area in 2000 with a letter to the central bank’s then-president,
 Ernst Welteke , Bild said, citing from the letter.  Hans Eichel , the finance minister at the time, sent the
letter after Bundesbank official  Hans Reckers  said in April 2000
that Greece’s entry should be delayed for a year, in part
because of its  public debt , the  newspaper  reported.  Eichel urged  Welteke  to tell Reckers that “he isn’t
authorized to issue a verdict” on Greece’s readiness for the
euro, Bild said. “I will apologize in writing to my Greek
colleague for Mr. Reckers’ comments,” Eichel said in the
letter. Reckers was head of the Bundesbank’s regional branch in
the state of Hesse, whose main city is Frankfurt. Greece joined
the euro in 2001.  The newspaper cited two lawmakers from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s governing coalition as calling for a parliamentary
inquiry into decisions on Greece under Eichel, who served in a
Social Democratic government. The Social Democrats are now in
opposition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
