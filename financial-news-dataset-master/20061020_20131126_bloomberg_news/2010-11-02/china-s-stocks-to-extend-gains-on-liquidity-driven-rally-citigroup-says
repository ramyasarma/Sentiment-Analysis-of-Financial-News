China’s stocks will extend a rally as
a rising yuan and U.S. monetary stimulus attract inflows and a
clampdown on property speculation drives savings into equities,
according to Citigroup Inc.  “Though choppy in the near-term, the liquidity-driven
rally will likely carry on in the next six months,” according
to Citigroup analysts led by  Minggao Shen  in a report. The
brokerage raised its year-end estimates for the Shanghai A-Share
Stock Price Index, the CSI 300 Index and the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index to reflect “strong momentum.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index  climbed 12 percent in October,
the most since July 2009 and second-biggest gain among 88 global
stock gauges tracked by Bloomberg. The index slipped 0.2 percent
to 3,046 at 10:21 a.m. today after jumping 2.5 percent yesterday
as a report showed China’s manufacturing expanded at the fastest
pace in six months.  A faster appreciation in the yuan against the dollar and a
widening gap in interest rates between China and the U.S. and
Japan will attract more fund inflows, benefiting the equity
market, according to Citigroup.  China’s central bank on Oct. 19 raised rates for the first
time since 2007. The benchmark one-year lending rate was
increased by a quarter of a percentage point on Oct. 19 to 5.56
percent and the deposit rate by the same amount, to 2.5 percent.  The Shanghai Composite rebounded last month as commodity
producers rallied on speculation U.S. asset purchases will boost
inflation. The measure remains down 6.8 percent this year after
government raised bank reserve requirements and curbed lending
growth to avert asset bubbles.  QE2  The U.S. Federal Reserve will probably begin a new round of
monetary stimulus this week by announcing a plan to buy at least
$500 billion of long-term securities, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Citigroup joins Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BNP Paribas in
predicting Chinese stocks will extend gains. The CSI 300 Index,
which tracks the 300 biggest Chinese companies traded in
Shanghai and Shenzhen, may rise to 4,300 by next year, Goldman
Sachs analysts led by  Helen Zhu  wrote in a note yesterday.  “The market is only going to go up from here,”  Erwin Sanft , head of China and Hong Kong research at BNP, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview. Operating
cashflows rose 45 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, he said.  Citigroup boosted its year-end forecast for the Shanghai A-
Share index to between 3,300 and 3,500, compared with the
previous estimate of 2,800 to 3,100. The CSI 300 may rally to
3,600 to 3,800, from the previous estimate of 2,900 to 3,100.  Citigroup Forecasts  The  Hang Seng China , which tracks Hong Kong-traded Chinese
companies, may rise to 13,800 to 14,500 by the end of 2010,
Citigroup said. The brokerage previously forecast 12,000 to
13,000 for the index.  The CSI 300 Index fell 0.2 percent to 3,464 today, while
the Hang Seng China index advanced 0.1 percent to 13,515.26.  China’s stocks will be “range-bound” this month, as some
investors are likely to sell shares amid the rally, according to
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. The Shanghai Composite will
trade between 2,900 and 3,150 in November, analysts led by Yuan
Yi at the Shanghai-based brokerage wrote in a report today.  Citigroup increased its rating on China’s banks to
“neutral” and lowered the recommendation on the property and
phone industries to “underweight,” according to the report.  -- Chua Kong Ho  in Shanghai. With assistance from  Zhang Shidong .
