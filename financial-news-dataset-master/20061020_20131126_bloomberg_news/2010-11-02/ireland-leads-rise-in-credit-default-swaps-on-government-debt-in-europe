Ireland led an increase in the cost
of insuring against losses on European government bonds,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Ireland surged 28 basis points to 526,
surpassing yesterday’s record closing price, according to data
provider CMA.  Investors are concerned European Union leaders will force
burden sharing on bondholders after governments pledged 860
billion euros ($1.2 trillion) of taxpayer money to stem the
region’s deficit crisis. Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  is
under pressure to draw up a budget next month that will stave
off an international bailout.  “The sovereign debt story is far from over,”  Simon Ballard , a credit strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London,
wrote in a note to investors.  Greek credit-default swaps climbed 18 basis points to 850,
the highest level since Sept. 17, while Portugal jumped 15.5
basis points to an almost one-month high of 395. Spain rose 6 to
230 and Italy increased 3.5 to 178.5. The Markit iTraxx SovX
Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments rose 2.5 to a
one-month high of 160.  The cost of insuring corporate bonds was little changed,
with the Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 investment-grade
companies up 0.75 basis point at 99.25 and the Markit iTraxx
Financial Index linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers 1 higher at 127.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings was unchanged at 457.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
