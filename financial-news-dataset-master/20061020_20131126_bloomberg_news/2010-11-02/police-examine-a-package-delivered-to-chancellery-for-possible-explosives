German police are investigating a
package that arrived at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin for
possible explosives, the government said.  The package, sent to  Angela Merkel ’s Chancellery in the
center of the German capital, was found to contain “suspicious
characteristics” during a routine mail search, government
spokesman  Steffen Seibert  said in an e-mailed statement.
Explosives experts were called in to examine the object.  “It can’t be ruled out that the package possibly contains
explosive material,” Seibert said. Nobody was injured.  The incident followed the arrest in central Athens
yesterday of two men found with parcel bombs addressed to
the Belgian embassy in Greece and to French President Nicolas
Sarkozy. Greek police said small parcel bombs exploded today at
the Swiss and Russian embassies in Athens and at least another
three packages addressed to foreign missions, including the
German embassy, were disarmed.  Merkel was not in Berlin today. She traveled to Belgium to
meet with Prime Minister  Yves Leterme  in Brussels and deliver a
speech in Bruges.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
