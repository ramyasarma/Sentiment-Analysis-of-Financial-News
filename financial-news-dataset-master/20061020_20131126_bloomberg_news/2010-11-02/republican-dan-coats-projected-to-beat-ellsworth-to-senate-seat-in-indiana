Republican  Dan Coats  defeated
Democratic U.S. Representative  Brad Ellsworth  in the race to
fill an open Indiana Senate seat, according to projections by
the Associated Press and CNN.  Coats, 67, who served in the Senate and House in the 1980s
and ‘90s, will fill the seat now held by Democrat  Evan Bayh , who
is retiring.  With 4 percent of precincts reporting, Coats had 54 percent
of the vote, and Ellsworth, 52, had 41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
