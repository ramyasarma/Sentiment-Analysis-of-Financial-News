French stayer Americain won the 150th
edition of the A$6 million ($6 million) Melbourne Cup to become
the fourth northern hemisphere-trained horse to win Australia’s
richest race.  Ridden by French jockey Gerald Mosse, the five-year-old
trained by Alain de Royer Dupre beat Maluckyday to the line by 2
3/4 lengths in the 2-mile (3,200-meter) handicap at Flemington
Racecourse to claim the A$3.6 million first prize. Race favorite
So You Think finished third.  Americain followed up its victory in last month’s Geelong
Cup to join Ireland’s Vintage Crop and Media Puzzle, and Japan’s
Delta Blues, as the only horses trained outside Australia and
New Zealand to have  won the Cup  since it was first run in 1861.  “It looked a difficult challenge to come from France and
to be competitive but I was very confident,” Royer Dupre said
in a televised interview with Channel Seven. “Gerald did a very
good ride and we’ve had two people with this horse for one month
and they made for a very good result.”  Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s biggest gambling
company, paid A$12.30 for a winning A$1 bet and A$3.60 for a
top-three place on Americain. Maluckyday paid A$3.00 for a place
and So You Think returned A$2.10 for finishing third.  So You Think, which won its five previous races, was run
down in the straight after starting as the A$3.30 bookmakers’
favorite to give Australian trainer  Bart Cummings  a record-
extending 13th victory in the so-called race that stops a
nation.  ‘Stop, Start’  “It was a bit of a stop, start sort of race and just got
him out of his rhythm a little bit,” said Steven Arnold, So You
Think’s jockey. “The winner was too strong.”  So You Think hit the front of the 23-horse field with about
300 meters to go in the straight before Mosse took Americain
down the center of the rain-affected track with a late surge. He
blew a kiss to the trackside crowd of more than 100,000 as he
flashed past the winning post.  “I pressed the button at the right time,” Mosse, 43,
said. “It’s never happened too often in my life when I feel all
the crowd, they’re making so much noise. I enjoyed that
moment.”  Holberg was the next-best of the international entrants,
finishing in sixth place for Dubai ruler  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum’s  Godolphin stable. The Luca Cumani-trained
Manighar was seventh and U.K. stayer Illustrious Blue ninth.  Other Runners  Campanologist, Godolphin’s other runner, finished 16th
ahead of Profound Beauty, which was prepared by two-time
Melbourne Cup-winning trainer  Dermot Weld  of Ireland.  Weld was the first northern hemisphere trainer to take home
the Cup with Vintage Crop in 1993 and repeated the feat in 2002
with Media Puzzle. Japanese stablemates Delta Blues and Pop Rock
finished first and second in 2006.  While Americain was bred in the U.S. and trained in France,
owners Gerry Ryan and Kevin Bamford are from Australia, where
the horse arrived on Sept. 25 to undergo the necessary
quarantine protocols.  “It’s been our dream, Kevin and I. About five years ago we
planned this and here we are,” Ryan told Channel Seven. “It is
a truly international event, an American-bred horse, a French
trainer, a Hong Kong-based jockey and Australian owners.”  Held on the first Tuesday of November, a public holiday in
Melbourne, the Cup is seen or heard on television or radio by
about 85 percent of Australia’s 22 million people, according to
 Victoria Racing Club  estimates.  2010 MELBOURNE CUP FINISHING ORDER:  ===================================  1. Americain  2. Maluckyday  3. So You Think  4. Zipping  5. Harris Tweed  6. Holberg  7.
