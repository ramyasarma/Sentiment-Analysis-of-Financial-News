President  Barack Obama  urged Yemen’s
President  Ali Abdullah Saleh  to reinforce air cargo security as
authorities in the U.S. and overseas pressed ahead with an
investigation into the attempt to conceal bombs in airborne
shipments, the White House said.  U.S., Yemeni and European investigators are working to
uncover more details of a terrorist plot that revolved around
two bombs concealed in printer cartridges found in packages that
originated in Yemen. U.S. authorities have said they suspect a
master bomb-maker from al-Qaeda made the explosives.  Obama emphasized in a telephone conversation with Saleh
that Yemen must strengthen its screening of air cargo and the
two discussed “the global community coming together to assist
Yemen in building these capabilities,” according to a White
House statement.  Germany began barring Yemenia Airways flights from landing
at its airports last weekend, and the U.K. said it will prohibit
unaccompanied air freight from both Yemen and Somalia and stop
some printer cartridges from going on flights.  Saleh urged Obama to press European countries for a review
of their decision to restrict package deliveries from Yemen in
the wake of the attempted bombing, the state-owned Saba news
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
