Canadian stocks  rose, led by banks
and metal producers, as gold and copper surged on speculation
that low interest rates will boost demand for alternative
investments and investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
stimulus decision.  Toronto-Dominion Bank , the country’s second-biggest bank,
Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia advanced at least
0.4 percent as lenders rallied for a second day. Barrick Gold
Corp., the world’s biggest gold producer, rose 0.1 percent.
Equinox Minerals Ltd., the owner of Africa’s biggest copper
mine, surged 2.1 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 39.05
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,703.86 as of 9:53 a.m. in Toronto.  The index advanced four straight months through October as
commodity prices have surged on a weaker U.S. dollar. The
greenback declined  10 percent  against a basket of world
currencies in the July-to-October period as investors speculated
U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus currencies will weaken the
currency by increasing the money supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
