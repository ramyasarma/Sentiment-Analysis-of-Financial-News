Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Europe’s
second-largest airline, said it’s taking a “wait-and-see”
approach to the possible purchase of a stake in  SAS Group AB .  Buying a holding in SAS “hasn’t worked out so far,
unfortunately, but we’ll wait and see,” spokeswoman  Claudia Lange  said today, citing Supervisory Board Chairman  Juergen Weber . SAS rose the most in more than two months.  SAS’s business has suffered in the last decade as low-cost
carriers  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA ,  Ryanair Holdings Plc  and Air
Berlin Plc offered cheaper flights, and  Finnair Oyj  concentrated
on lucrative Asian destinations. SAS has lost 10.5 billion
kronor ($1.6 billion) since the beginning of 2008 and posted a
net loss in each of the last three quarters. Lufthansa has
previously expressed interest in a possible SAS stake purchase.  “We never comment or speculate regarding ownership
issues,” Elisabeth Manzi, an SAS spokeswoman, said by
telephone.  SAS rose as much as 1.50 euros, or 5.9 percent, to 26.80
euros, the biggest intra-day gain since Aug. 19, and was up 3.2
percent as of 11:52 a.m. in Stockholm trading. Lufthansa shares
rose 1 percent to 15.64 euros in Frankfurt trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
