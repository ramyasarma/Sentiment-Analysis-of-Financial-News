Coffee may reach $2.10 a pound in New
York this week, extending its rally to the highest level in 13
years, because of bullish technical patterns and concern that
global demand will exceed supply, said Phillip Futures Pte.  Prices “may be well supported” by the 100-day exponential
moving average, and the “trending up” of 14-day and 25-day
exponential moving averages may signal the “uptrend may not end
soon,” said  Ker Chung Yang , an analyst at the Singapore-based
brokerage, yesterday. The moving average convergence/divergence
indicator is also showing signs of a bullish trend, Ker said.  The mild-tasting arabica variety used by Starbucks Corp.
and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. has climbed 46 percent
this year on concern unfavorable weather in Central and South
America and shipment delays in Brazil’s Santos Port will curb
supplies. Brazil is the world’s largest producer and Colombia is
the second-biggest exporter of the arabica variety.  “Recently both Brazil and Costa Rica cut their crop
estimates while Colombia and Central America have struggled with
unexpected rain,” said Ker. “This may exacerbate a potential
worldwide production shortfall.”  Arabica coffee gained to $2.046 a pound on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York on Oct. 26, the highest price since August 1997, and
the December-delivery contract ended at $1.9785 yesterday.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
