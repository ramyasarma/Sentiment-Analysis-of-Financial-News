Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva may reduce the size of salary increases for some
government workers and offer tax breaks to help industries
suffering because of the real’s appreciation,  Folha de S. Paulo 
said, without revealing where it got the information.  Lula wants to take the measures before his administration
ends Dec. 31 to help protect the popularity of President-elect
Dilma Rousseff, the newspaper said.  The next government may lower the inflation target to about
4 percent in 2012 from the current 4.5 percent, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
