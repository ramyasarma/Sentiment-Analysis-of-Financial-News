South African vehicle sales surged 22
percent in October from a year earlier as the lowest interest
rates in 30 years spurred consumer spending.  Sales growth accelerated from 17 percent in September, the
Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of South Africa said in an e-mailed statement today. A total of
44,056 vehicles were sold in October.  South African auto sales returned to growth in January as
the  economy  emerged from the first recession in 17 years,
boosted by a series of central bank cuts that have taken the
benchmark interest  rate  to 6 percent.  Vehicle exports climbed an annual 31 percent to 27,338 in
October, and more than doubled from the previous month after
strikes in the industry ended, the association said.  Carmakers including  Volkswagen AG  and  General Motors Co. 
shut their plants for eight days in August after workers went on
strike to demand higher pay. Auto-parts workers then went on
strike for almost two weeks in September, disrupting output.  To contact the reporters on this story:
