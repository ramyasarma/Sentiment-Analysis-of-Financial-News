Linde AG , the world’s second-biggest
maker of industrial gases, said third-quarter profit rose 50
percent as the global economic recovery raised demand from car
and chemical manufacturers.  Net income  increased to 253 million euros ($353 million)
from 169 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company
said today in a  statement . Sales rose 16 percent to 3.3 billion
euros. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had  estimated  net income
of 247.8 million euros on sales of 3.24 billion euros.  German manufacturers including  BASF SE , the world’s biggest
chemical maker, and  Daimler AG , the second-largest luxury-car
maker, have increased full-year earnings outlooks in the past
week because of economic growth forecasts. Germany’s government
predicted on Oct. 21 that gross domestic product in 2010 will
expand by 3.4 percent, the fastest pace since 1991, compared
with an earlier outlook of 1.4 percent growth.  “We have taken advantage of the economic recovery and our
profitability has continued to increase,” Linde Chief Executive
Officer  Wolfgang Reitzle  said in the statement.  Linde reiterated that group sales and earnings will rise
this year, with operating-profit growth outpacing revenue
increases. The gases division will report record operating
profit and sales, the company said.  The engineering unit’s operating profit will amount to at
least 10 percent of sales, compared with an earlier prediction
of an 8 percent  margin , Linde said. New orders at the unit
almost tripled to 576 million euros from 215 million euros
during the quarter, while the order backlog as of Sept. 30
declined 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 4.14 billion euros.  Linde  fell  as much as 2.35 euros, or 2.3 percent, to 101.45
euros, the biggest intraday drop since Oct. 7, and was down
1.9 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. That pared
the stock’s  gain  this year to 21 percent. Shares of Paris-based
 Air Liquide SA , the world’s biggest producer of industrial
gases, have also risen 21 percent this year, while Allentown,
Pennsylvania-based  Air Products & Chemicals Inc. ’s stock has
gained 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
