YouTube reposted videos that led to a
30-month ban on accessing the site from Turkey, according to a
spokeswoman for the company.  The videos alleged by Turkey to be offensive were removed
in the past week when a company set up in Germany by the Turkish
Internet Board used YouTube’s automated copyright-complaint
mechanism to have them taken down. Removal of the material led
authorities to restore access to the site for the first time
since May 2008.  YouTube, owned by  Google Inc. , found after investigation
that the videos didn’t violate its copyright policies and
decided to repost them to make them accessible from outside of
Turkey, Ozlem Oz, deputy country manager for Grayling Public
Relations, which represents Google, said in an e-mailed message
late yesterday.  The videos were deemed by Turkish courts to have insulted
the founder of modern Turkey,  Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , which is a
crime in the country. YouTube remained accessible from Turkey as
of 11:30 a.m. local time today.  Turkish visitors to the YouTube site have been able to
circumvent the ban by using so-called proxy websites.  Las Vegas-based Gabriel Ramuglia, 27, manager of hundreds
of proxy sites, told Turkey’s  Hurriyet Daily News  that YouTube-
specific traffic from Turkey, which made up for a substantial
portion of his revenue, had dropped by half in three days
following the lifting of the ban. The newspaper didn’t give
specifics of the decline in revenue.  More than 4,000 other websites remain banned in Turkey,
Hurriyet reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
