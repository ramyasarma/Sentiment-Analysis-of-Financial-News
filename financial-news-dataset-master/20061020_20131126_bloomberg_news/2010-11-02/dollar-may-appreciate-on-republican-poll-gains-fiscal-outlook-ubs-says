The dollar may rise on Republican
gains in U.S. mid-term elections today as investors bet that
such an outcome will help limit government spending, according
to UBS AG.  Reports “suggest the Republicans will make strong gains in
both the House of Representatives and the Senate, which could be
dollar-supportive in the near term should investors expect less
fiscal spending as a result,”  Gareth Berry , a currency
strategist in Singapore at UBS AG, wrote in a report today.  The Dollar Index fell 0.3 percent to 77.084 as of 7:29 a.m.
in London. Against the euro, the U.S. currency depreciated 0.3
percent to $1.3932.  To contact the reporter on this story:
