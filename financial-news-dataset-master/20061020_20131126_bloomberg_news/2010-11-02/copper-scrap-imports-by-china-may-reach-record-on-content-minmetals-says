China’s scrap  copper  imports may
reach a record this year in terms of metal content as rising
labor costs drive companies to seek higher quality material, an
official at China Minmetals Nonferrous Metals Co. said today.  The metal content in imports this year has climbed to 39
percent from 18 percent to 20 percent copper before 2008, Ma
Xiaoxin, vice general manager of the copper department at China
Minmetals, said today.  “This year the scrap copper imports will hit a record, in
terms of the copper content,” Ma said in an interview at a
conference in Ningbo, Zhejiang. “The customs’ scrap copper
imports data don’t tell the whole story,” Ma said.  The copper contained in scrap imports totaled 1.1 million
metric tons in January to August, Ma said. The figure for 2009
was 1.2 million tons, she said.  “Rising labor costs mean it’s no longer profitable to
import scrap which only contains a 10 percent to 20 percent
copper,” Ma said. As China’s copper raw material shortage 
will increase by 87 percent from 2009 to 5.89 million tons
in 2015, scrap will have to play an even bigger role, Ma said.  China will compete with Japan and Korea for such scrap amid
growing domestic labor costs, Ma said. Imports in January-
September gained 7.6 percent to 3.2 million tons, according to
customs data.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
