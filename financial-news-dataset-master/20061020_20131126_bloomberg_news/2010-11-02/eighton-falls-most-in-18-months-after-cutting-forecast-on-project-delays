Leighton Holdings Ltd. , Australia’s
biggest construction company, plunged the most in almost six
months in Sydney trading after forecasting an A$85 million
($84.7 million) cut to first-quarter profit.  The Sydney-based company  fell  7 percent to A$33.75 at the
4:10 p.m. local time close on the Australian stock exchange.
That’s the most since May 17.  Leighton will post an after-tax profit for the three months
to Sept. 30 of A$47 million, Chief Executive  Wal King  said in a
statement today, citing delays and increased costs at the A$4
billion Airport Link project in Brisbane, the strength of the
local currency and reduced earnings from a rail project.  The expected profit from the sale of a 35 percent stake in
Leighton’s Indian operations will more than offset the cut to
earnings in the quarter, King said. The company expects full-
year operating profit after tax of A$510 million on revenue of
about A$20 billion, he said.  The Airport Link project is more than 60 percent complete
and is expected to be finished in mid-2012, King said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
