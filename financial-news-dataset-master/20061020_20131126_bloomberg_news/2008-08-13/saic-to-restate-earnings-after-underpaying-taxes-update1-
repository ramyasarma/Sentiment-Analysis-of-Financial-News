             SAIC Inc. (SAI) , the San Diego-based
military contractor specializing in computer services, plans to
restate earnings back to fiscal year 2006 after determining it
underpaid income taxes by about $27 million in the sale of its
Telcordia Technologies unit.  
 SAIC said in a  regulatory filing  today that it plans to file
the restatements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
September.  
 SAIC sold Telcordia in March 2006. The error was
unintentional and no penalties are expected, the company said.
SAIC will take a charge this fiscal year of about $2 million for
interest on the unpaid taxes.  
 The restatements will span results from fiscal 2006 through
the first quarter of fiscal 2009 ended April 30. SAIC rose 2
cents to $18.92 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
 trading .
