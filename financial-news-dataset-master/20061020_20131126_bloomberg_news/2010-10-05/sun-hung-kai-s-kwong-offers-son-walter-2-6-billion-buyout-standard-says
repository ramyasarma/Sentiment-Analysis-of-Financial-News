Kwong Siu-hing, chairwoman of  Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd ., has offered her son Walter Kwok a
HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) buyout from the family’s trusts,
the Standard said, citing unidentified people.  The attempt to cut Kwok out started a year ago, with a plan
to pay him HK$13 billion, an amount that was too low given his
HK$48 billion share in the trusts, the Hong Kong-based English-
language newspaper reported today. The money for the buyout will
probably come from dividends paid into the trusts, the Standard
said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
