The Miami Dolphins fired special
teams coordinator  John Bonamego  after mistakes led to three New
England touchdowns in a 41-14 loss to the Patriots.  The Dolphins had two kicks blocked and also gave up a 103-
yard kickoff return for a touchdown last night. Miami had a punt
blocked in a loss to the New York Jets a week ago.  Assistant special teams coach  Darren Rizzi  will replace
Bonamego, Dolphins coach  Tony Sparano  said today during a news
conference. Bonamego, 47, joined the Dolphins in 2008 when
Sparano was named coach.  The Dolphins led 7-6 at halftime last night before the
Patriots’  Brandon Tate  returned the second-half kickoff for a
touchdown. New England’s  Pat Chung  blocked a third-quarter
Miami punt to set up another touchdown and also blocked a field
goal in the fourth quarter that  Kyle Arrington  returned 35
yards to put the Patriots up 34-14.  The Dolphins fell to 2-2, one game behind the Patriots and
Jets in the American Football Conference’s East Division. Miami
is off this week and next plays Oct. 17 at the Green Bay
Packers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
