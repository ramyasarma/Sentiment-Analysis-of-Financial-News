Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, scientific
adviser to the Cuban government and son of former President
 Fidel Castro , said Japan’s economic development provides an
example as his country encourages more private enterprise.  “The paradigm of Japan, lacking a lot of natural resources
and managing to recover from an awful war to become the second
or third economy, is for us a good example,” Castro Diaz-Balart,
61, said today in an interview in Kyoto.  Castro Diaz-Balart, who was attending the  Science and
Technology in Society  forum in the western Japanese city, said
Cuba’s efforts to develop the private sector are aimed at “non-
strategic areas.” Japan and Cuba could form ties in fields such
as biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and education, he said.  “We have some possibilities in the future, step-by-step,
to enhance our collaboration with Japan,” he said.  Cuba, which has followed a communist economic system since
Castro Diaz-Balart’s father ousted dictator  Fulgencio Batista  in
1959, last month released plans to allow more private enterprise
and shrink the public sector. The state newspaper  reported  more
than 500,000 government jobs will be cut by March as part of
President  Raul Castro ’s plan to eliminate 1 million positions to
reduce inefficiencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
