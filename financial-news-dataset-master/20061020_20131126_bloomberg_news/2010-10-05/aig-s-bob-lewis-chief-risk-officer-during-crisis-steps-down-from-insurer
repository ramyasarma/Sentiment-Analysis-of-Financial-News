PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s two-
year-old, $97.5 million settlement with holders of  American
International Group Inc.  securities is set to go before a
federal judge next month.  The accounting firm said in October 2008 it would
compensate the plaintiffs for their losses to avoid “enormous
litigation costs” over claims it helped AIG mislead investors.
The settlement won preliminary court approval and is scheduled
for a hearing in Manhattan on Nov. 30, law firm Labaton Sucharow
said today in a statement.  An investigation by then-New York Attorney General  Eliot Spitzer  and U.S. regulators triggered a $3.9 billion earnings
restatement by AIG in May 2005 and led to the ouster of   Maurice “Hank” Greenberg , the New York-based insurer’s chief executive
officer for almost 40 years.  Plaintiffs in the proposed class-action suit, who held
shares of companies that AIG bought with its stock, include the
Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, according to court
documents.  Steven Silber , a PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman, said he
couldn’t immediately comment. The firm said in 2008 that its
work for AIG was “in accordance with professional standards.”  The case is In re American International Group Inc.
