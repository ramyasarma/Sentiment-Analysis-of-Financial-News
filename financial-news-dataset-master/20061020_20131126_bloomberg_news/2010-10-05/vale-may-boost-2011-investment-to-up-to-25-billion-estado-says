Vale SA  may almost double its
investment in 2011 to as much as $25 billion, O Estado de S.
Paulo reported, without saying where it got the information.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro, will boost spending by at
least $10 billion, excluding funds for eventual acquisitions,
the newspaper said. The iron-ore producer is likely to announce
its investment plan in New York on Oct. 18, Estado said.    Vale plans to spend $12.9 billion this year, Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
