Private equity-led acquisitions done
during booming stock markets deliver similar returns as
comparable publicly traded companies, a study shows.  Private equity deals on average haven’t beat comparable
listed companies’ performances when public markets rose more
than 15 percent a year during the period the asset was held,
according to the study, released today, that analyzed more than
4,000 private equity transactions since 1977.  In phases of strong positive price developments on stock
markets, private equity “often produces good returns, but these
are largely driven by the positive market environment,”  Oliver Gottschalg , associate professor of strategy and business policy
at HEC School of Management near Paris and author of the study,
said. “Private equity firms, however, seem to protect value
during downturns.”  Private equity-led deals delivered an alpha, or excess
return, of 15.5 percent in recessions, when public markets
decreased by at least 5 percent a year during the holding
period, and an alpha of 5 percent to 10 percent in “stable and
moderately positive” phases, according to the study conducted
jointly with German funds of funds  Golding Capital Partners .  To contact the reporter on this story:
