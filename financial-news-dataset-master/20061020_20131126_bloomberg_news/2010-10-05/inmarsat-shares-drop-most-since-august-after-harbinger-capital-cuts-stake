Inmarsat Plc  fell the most in more
than a month in London after  Philip Falcone’s  Harbinger Capital
Partners sold about half of its 28 percent holding and ruled
out making an offer for the rest of the company.  Inmarsat shares slid 4 percent to 629 pence, the biggest
drop since Aug. 19. The stock has fallen 9.1 percent this year,
valuing the operator of satellite communications systems at
about 2.9 billion pounds ($4.6 billion).  Harbinger today said it had sold 14 percent of Inmarsat,
or 65 million ordinary shares, for 410 million pounds.
Yesterday the New York-based hedge fund ended speculation that
it would make a bid for all of Inmarsat by ruling out a
takeover attempt.  Harbinger and U.S. satellite company SkyTerra
Communications Inc. considered a full takeover of Inmarsat in
2008, seeking to combine satellite holdings and offer services
for mobile Internet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
