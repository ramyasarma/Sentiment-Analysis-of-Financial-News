Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
agreed to buy an additional 10 percent stake in the 407 Express
Toll Route near Toronto for C$894 million ($879 million) from
Ferrovial SA of Spain.  Canada Pension’s purchase from Madrid-based Ferrovial’s
Cintra Infraestructuras unit comes almost six weeks after the
Toronto-based fund agreed to a A$3.44 billion ($3.34 billion)
takeover of  Intoll Group , which owns 30 percent of the road.
Canada Pension will own 40 percent of the highway when both
deals close.  “It’s a very good asset that really fits squarely in our
infrastructure strategy,”  Andre Bourbonnais , senior vice
president of private investments at Canada Pension, said in an
interview today. “It’s in our backyard, we know the environment
and we understand it.”  Canada Pension, the country’s second-largest retirement
fund manager, has been increasing investments in infrastructure
in the last five years. At the end of June, it had about C$6.1
billion worth of utilities in its C$129.7 billion investment
portfolio, according to filings.  “We are looking for these kinds of opportunities where we
can invest a lot of capital,” Bourbonnais said. “If you have
an asset you understand well, it’s so much easier.”  The 407 ETR is 53.3 percent owned by Cintra, with SNC-
Lavalin Group Inc., the Montreal-based construction firm, owning
16.77 percent, Canada Pension said today in a statement.  Canada Pension agreed on Aug. 27 to buy Sydney-based Intoll
after failing earlier in the year to buy Australian toll-road
operator Transurban Group.  The Intoll and Ferrovial transactions may close by the end
of the year, Bourbonnais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
