Zimbabwe ’s government received five
bids for its 70 percent stake in Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Co.,
said Industry Minister  Welshman Ncube .  The offers are being reviewed by President  Robert Mugabe ,
Ncube said in a phone interview today from Harare, the capital.
He declined to identify the companies bidding for the stake.  “We will only name the companies after the president has
reviewed the bids,” Ncube said.  Jindal Steel and Power Ltd.  of India and  ArcelorMittal
South Africa Ltd.  in May had offers rejected by Mugabe, who said
the companies were too big and Zimbabwe needed a “medium-sized
investor.”  The first round of bids, which closed on May 5, included
Jindal, ArcelorMittal,  Murray and Roberts Ltd.  and Reclamation
Ltd. of South Africa, Steelmakers Zimbabwe Ltd. and a group
known as the Gateway Consortium.  Zisco, based in Redcliff in Zimbabwe’s Midlands Province,
has debts of $228 million and is “not functional” because its
blast furnace requires repairs, the state-controlled  Herald 
newspaper reported in May, without saying where it got the
information from.  At its peak, the company produced as much as 1 million
metric tons of steel annually and employed 4,000 people, making
it sub-Saharan Africa’s largest steelmaker outside South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
