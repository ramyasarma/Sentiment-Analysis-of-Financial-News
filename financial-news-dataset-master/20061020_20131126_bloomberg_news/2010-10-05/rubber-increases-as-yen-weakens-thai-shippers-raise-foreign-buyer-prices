Rubber gained as a weaker Japanese
currency raised the appeal of yen-based contracts and after
shippers in Thailand, the largest producer, raised cash prices
for overseas buyers on stronger demand.  The March-delivery contract gained as much as 0.7 percent
to 317.8 yen per kilogram ($3,794 a metric ton) before settling
at 317.6 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The price reached
318.2 yen yesterday, the highest level for a most-active
contract since April 26.  Japan’s currency fell against the dollar after the Bank of
Japan cut its key interest rate and said it would step up asset
purchases to spur the economy. The yen slid against 14 of its 16
major counterparts after the BOJ said it would create a 5
trillion yen fund to buy government bonds and other assets.  “The weakening of the yen and bright prospects for car
sales support the gains of the rubber market,” Varut Rungkhum,
an analyst at commodity broker Agro Wealth Ltd., said by phone
from Bangkok.  The yen declined to 83.64 per dollar at 2:37 p.m. in
Singapore, from 83.36 in New York yesterday, after strengthening
to 83.16 on Oct. 1, the highest since Sept. 15.  Thai exporters have raised offers for so-called RSS-3 grade
rubber for November shipment to about $3.65 a kilogram, from
$3.60 at the end of last week, said  Shuji Sugata , research
manager at Mitsubishi Corp. Futures Ltd.  “Cash prices gained on strong demand from tire makers,
buoying the futures market,” Sugata said by phone today. “A
weaker yen gave more support.”  Auto Sales  U.S. auto sales in September rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 11.8 million, compared with 9.4 million a year
earlier, data from researcher Autodata Corp. showed on Oct. 1.  September’s stronger sales, bolstered by  Ford Motor Co. ’s
41 percent sales gain, are a sign that the car market may have
bottomed out and that a slow, stable recovery is under way, said
 Jesse Toprak , vice president of industry trends for TrueCar.com.  The benchmark Thai rubber price gained 0.2 percent to
110.65 baht ($3.67) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of Thailand. A lack of supply continued to
drive prices higher, the institute said.  The Shanghai rubber market is closed as China marks
National Day holidays from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7.  Natural-rubber inventories monitored by the bourse expanded
4,680 tons to 31,580 tons, based on a survey of 10 warehouses,
the exchange said Sept. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
