Copper rose to the highest price in
26 months as the dollar dropped, boosting demand for commodities
as alternative assets. Tin climbed to a record.  The  dollar  dropped as much as 1 percent against a basket of
six currencies after the Bank of Japan cut its benchmark
interest rate and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the U.S. central bank may buy more debt. The Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 raw materials climbed as much as 1.6 percent.  “The dollar is rolling again, and commodities are higher
across the board,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle
Futures Group in Chicago. “As long as money printing continues,
people are going to want to have physical assets in their
hands.”  Copper futures for December delivery rose 6.25 cents, or
1.7 percent, to close at $3.7265 a pound at 1:32 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the metal reached $3.745, the
highest price for a most-active contract since July 30, 2008.  Copper has gained 30 percent since July 1, partly as
 stockpiles  tracked by the London Metal Exchange dropped to the
lowest level since November.  On the LME, the commodity for delivery in three months rose
$112, or 1.4 percent, to $8,176 a metric ton ($3.71 a pound).  “We still favor copper and believe that shortages will
lead to price spikes in 2011,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
analysts led by  Jeffrey Currie  in London said in a report today.  The metal will trade at $11,000 a ton in a year, the bank
said, compared with an estimate of $8,050 in a Sept. 17 note.
Prices reached a record $8,940 on July 2, 2008.  Tin for three-month delivery rose $725, or 2.9 percent, to
$25,925 a ton in London. Earlier, the metal reached $26,010, the
highest price ever. The previous record, set in May 2008, was
$25,500.  This year, tin has jumped 53 percent, the most among metals
traded in London. Production disruptions in Indonesia and
Democratic Republic of Congo have helped bolster prices.  Aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc also rose on the LME.  To contact the reporters on the story:
