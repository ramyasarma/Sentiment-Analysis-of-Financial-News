The Australian dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart as stocks and commodities climbed,
overshadowing the central bank’s unexpected decision to keep
interest rates on hold for a fifth month. New Zealand’s dollar
reached an almost 11-month high versus the greenback.  Australia’s currency, called the Aussie, erased losses
against the U.S. dollar and the yen as the rallies in higher-
yielding assets fueled demand for currencies linked to global
growth. The Aussie earlier fell by the most in seven weeks
against the greenback as Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens 
kept the benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent.  “We’re going to see some buyers from the macro community
come in because it still offers fantastic value compared to the
G-7,” said  Tim O’Sullivan , chief trader at FOREX.com, referring
to Group of Seven nations. His firm is a unit of the online
currency trading company Gain Capital in Bedminster, New Jersey.  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 96.98 U.S.
cents at 1:42 p.m. in New York, from 96.83 cents yesterday.
Earlier it dropped 1.5 percent, the most on an intraday basis
since Aug. 11. The Aussie rose to 80.72 yen, from 80.71 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 1 percent
to 74.89 U.S. cents, from 74.18 cents. It touched 74.92 cents,
the strongest level since November 2009. The currency rose 0.8
percent to 62.33 yen, from 61.83 yen.  The kiwi pared earlier losses against the yen and dollar
after the Bank of Japan pledged to expand its balance sheet by 5
trillion yen ($60 billion) and lowered its benchmark interest
rate to a range of zero percent.  Increase Was Forecast  Only six of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
predicted the Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision to keep the
overnight cash rate target on hold. The median forecast was for
an increase to 4.75 percent.  “We have had no new information since the last meeting and
it’s clear the RBA wants to wait for additional information,”
said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP Australia
Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest interdealer broker. Carr
correctly forecast today’s decision.  The  MSCI World Index  rose 1.9 percent to the highest level
since May 4 and gold futures climbed to a record $1,342.60 an
ounce as speculation grew that central banks will join Japan’s
efforts to stoke economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
