Slovakia chose HSBC, Societe Generale
CIB, RZB Group’s Tatra Banka and the local unit of UniCredit
Bank to be the lead arrangers of its 15-year benchmark bond
issue, the Slovak debt-management agency said.  The euro-denominated bonds will be sold “in the near
future, subject to market conditions,” the agency known as
Ardal said in an e-mailed statement from Bratislava.  The country, rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service and A+
by Standard & Poor’s, wants to raise 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) through the sale and reopen the issue later through
domestic auctions, Ardal has said.  The Slovak government, in power since July, has approved an
austerity package to cut the  budget deficit  to 4.9 percent of
gross domestic product next year from an expected 7.8 percent in
2010. Slovak borrowing costs have fallen below those of higher-
rated fellow euro-zone members such as Italy on the government’s
effort to consolidate public finances.  Slovakia’s benchmark 10-year bond yielded 3.642 percent
today, or 149 basis points more than German bunds of the same
maturity, compared with a spread of 156 basis points on a
similar Italian bond. A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
