Carrefour SA , the world’s second-
largest retailer, said it hired KPMG LLP for an audit in Brazil
following the “poor performance” of company superstores there.  The Paris-based company so far has no evidence of
misconduct and will communicate the conclusions of the audit
when they’re available,  Helene Saint-Raymond , a spokeswoman said
by e-mail.  Carrefour will take a one-time 80 million-euro ($109
million) charge for uncollected rebates, inventory writedowns
and depreciation in Brazil, Saint-Raymond also said, repeating
an August estimate by Chief Financial Officer  Pierre Bouchut .  Carrefour is investigating its Brazilian unit’s accounts to
check for extraordinary losses that may not have been reported,
Valor Economico reported yesterday, without saying where it got
the information. Since May, when KPMG was hired, the company has
fired five executives, Valor said.  Carrefour’s first-half  activity contribution , a measure of
operating profit, fell 4.8 percent in Latin America because of
69 million euros of inventory write-offs and accounting
adjustments in Brazil, the retailer said Aug. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
