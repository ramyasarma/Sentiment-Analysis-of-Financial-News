MF Global Holdings Ltd., the futures
and options broker headed by former New Jersey Governor  Jon Corzine , hired  Jon Bass  from BTIG LLC as global head of
institutional sales.  Bass, 48, a former Salomon Brothers Inc. banker who helped
run fixed income at UBS AG, will start Dec. 1, according to two
people familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified
because the move isn’t public. BTIG confirmed the departure in
an e-mailed statement, 20 months after he joined the broker
dealer to help start its credit operation.  Corzine, who returned MF Global to  profitability  for the
three months ended June 30 after five consecutive losses by
cutting pay and jobs, has said he wants to expand the New York-
based firm into investment banking. MF Global has applied to
become a primary dealer of U.S. government securities to expand
into trades in which it takes on the kind of risk associated
with the world’s biggest banks.  “This is a good move for MF,” said  Richard Lipstein , a
consultant at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York. “He’s
a player.”  Bass confirmed he’s left BTIG and wasn’t immediately
available for further comment.  Tiffany Galvin , an MF spokeswoman
in New York, declined to comment.  BTIG “is fully committed to fixed income and continues to
hire relevant” people, according to the company’s e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
