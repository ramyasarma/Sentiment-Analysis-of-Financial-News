Australian retail sales rose in
August for a sixth straight month as consumers boosted spending
at restaurants and department stores.  Sales  increased 0.3 percent from July, when they advanced
0.7 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney today. The
median forecast of 24 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News was
for a gain of 0.4 percent.  Today’s report suggests households are weathering the most
aggressive round of interest-rate increases by a Group of 20
member as a mining boom drives down unemployment. Nineteen of 25
analysts polled by Bloomberg News last week expect Reserve Bank
of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  will increase the overnight
cash rate target to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent today.  “Underlying retail conditions improved a little in
August,”  Bill Evans , chief economist at Westpac Banking Corp.
in Sydney, said ahead of today’s report. “Consumer sentiment
continued to rally strongly with the detail suggesting some
easing in the consumer caution that has restrained spending in
recent years.”  Spending at restaurants jumped 1.5 percent and department
store purchases gained 0.6 percent, today’s report showed. By
contrast, consumers spent 1.5 percent less on clothing and shoes.  To contact the reporter for this story:
