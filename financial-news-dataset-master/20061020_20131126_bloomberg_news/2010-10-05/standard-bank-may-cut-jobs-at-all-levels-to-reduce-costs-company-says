Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s
biggest bank, said it will probably cut jobs at “all levels”
to reduce costs.  “Managers and executives” in Johannesburg and London will
be the focus of the cuts, the company said in an e-mailed
response to questions today. Talks with employees will start
“shortly,” the bank said, without giving further details.  “All indications are that the revenue pressure, which was
evident in the first six months of 2010, will probably continue
during 2011,” Johannesburg-based Standard said. “We therefore
have no option but to carefully re-examine our cost base”
including staff, which is the biggest cost to the bank.  While the company said on Aug. 12 that first-half net
income for the period ended June 30 rose 15 percent to 5.9
billion rand ($856 million), it also warned that the South
African economy may see a “modest pull-back” in the second
half of the year. Standard had almost 46,000 employees at the
end of 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  The company’s shares rose 78 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
109.69 rand by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, giving it a
market value of 173.7 billion rand.  The news was earlier reported by Reuters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
