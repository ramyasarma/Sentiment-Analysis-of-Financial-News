Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. fell
the most in three months in Hong Kong trading after Macau’s
casino revenue grew at the slowest pace this year.  Galaxy dropped as much as 6.9 percent to HK$6.37, the
biggest intraday decline since July 2, before trading at HK$6.47
as of the 12:30 p.m. break on the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Macau’s September casino revenue increased 39.8 percent to
15.3 billion patacas, compared with 40 percent growth in August.
That’s the slowest growth this year according to data from
Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
