Rio Tinto Group said it has not made
any final decisions about possible outcomes or next steps
relating to its proposed iron ore production joint venture with
BHP Billiton Ltd. in Western Australia.  Talks with regulators indicate potential obstacles to
achieving clearance for the joint venture, including the recent
receipt of interim reports from the Japan Fair Trade
Commission and the Korea Fair Trade Commission, and ongoing
discussions with the European Commission and the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
