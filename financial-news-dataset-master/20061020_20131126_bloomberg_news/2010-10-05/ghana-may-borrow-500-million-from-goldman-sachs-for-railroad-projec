Ghana may borrow $500 million from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to upgrade a railroad in southern
Ghana, an adviser to the country’s finance ministry said.  “It will have to go through parliament,” Newman Kusi said
in a phone interview from the capital, Accra, today. “Maybe
around November or December it will be completed.”  The loan will be repaid over seven years, Kusi said. He
declined to disclose the interest rate.  A Norwegian company, Africa Rail Ghana Ltd., will also
arrange financing for the project, which will link the port city
of Tema and Accra with the southern towns of Koforidua and
Nsawam, Kusi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
