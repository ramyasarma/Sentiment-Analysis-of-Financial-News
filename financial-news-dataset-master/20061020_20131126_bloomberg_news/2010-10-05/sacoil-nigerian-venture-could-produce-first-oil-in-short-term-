SacOil Holdings Ltd. , the South
African company searching for oil elsewhere on the continent,
said it may start oil production “in the short term” after
entering a joint venture in Nigeria.  The unincorporated 50:50 joint venture with Energy Equity
Resources will initially give SacOil access to onshore
recoverable resources of about 100 million barrels of oil
equivalent in Nigeria’s oil-rich Niger Delta,  Robin Vela , chief
executive officer of Johannesburg-based SacOil, told reporters
in the city today. The venture could eventually produce about
30,000 barrels a day, he said.  SacOil  was formed two years ago to take advantage of
Africa’s growing presence as an oil producer. Africa is expected
to surpass North America in 2011 to become the third-largest
producing area after the Middle East and Central/Eastern Europe,
PricewaterhouseCoopers said on Sept. 15. The continent is set to
experience a “flurry of exploration activity,” it said.  Shares in  SacOil  have jumped more than fivefold in
Johannesburg since June 25 when the company announced it had
been awarded a concession for Block 3 in the Democratic Republic
of Congo. The stock fell 1.1 percent to 87 cents at the 5 p.m.
close of trading in Johannesburg.  SacOil will invest its half of a $12.5 million exploration
program in the Block 3 Congo concession over the next two years,
Vela said. SacOil is searching for oil at the concession on the
border with Uganda together with Divine Inspiration Group Ltd.,
he said.  Dispute in Congo  SacOil, encouraged by  Tullow Oil Plc’s  finds on the Ugandan
side of Lake Albert, hopes to find oil and gas in  Block 3 ,
located on the Congolese side of the lake.  Together with Divine, SacOil is in talks with Congo to
“amicably” settle a dispute over rights to Block 1, also on
the Ugandan border, Vela said. SacOil has a production sharing
agreement there, he said.  The South African company won’t rule out foreign listings
when it needs to raise capital, given limited understanding of
oil assets by investors on the stock exchange in Johannesburg,
Vela said.  Encha Capital , a venture between the Moseneke family of
South Africa and Investec, is SacOil’s largest shareholder.
Metropolitan Asset Management, Stanlib and Investec are also
shareholders, he said.
