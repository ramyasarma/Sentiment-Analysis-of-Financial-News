Venture capitalist  John Doerr  and his
wife gave $1.5 million last week to a group that’s defending
global-warming legislation in California, bringing the couple’s
total contribution so far to $2 million.  Proposition 23, a ballot initiative that Californians will
vote on Nov. 2, would delay the Global Warming Solutions Act
until the state’s jobless rate, now 12.4 percent, falls to 5.5
percent for four consecutive quarters. The state law authorizes
a series of greenhouse gas-cutting programs, including a
California cap-and-trade market that’s due to start in 2012.  John Doerr, a partner at the venture capital firm  Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers  in Menlo Park, California, gave
$500,000 Sept. 30 to a committee that’s campaigning to defeat
Proposition 23, according to state records. His wife, Ann Doerr,
gave $1 million to the group the same day,  Steven Maviglio , a
spokesman for the committee, said in an e-mail. John Doerr had
earlier given $500,000 to the committee on Aug. 6.  The “No on 23” committee has raised $12.8 million so far
to pay for a campaign that includes television advertising and
independent polling, according to state records.  Tom Steyer ,
founder of San Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management LLC
and a co-chairman of the committee, gave $2.5 million on Sept.
30, bringing his total contribution to $5 million.  Other committees formed to campaign against Proposition 23
have raised a combined $3.3 million. The committee supporting
Proposition 23, whose donors include San Antonio-based refiners
 Tesoro Corp.  and  Valero Energy Corp. , has raised $8.4 million,
according to state records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
