Senior lenders to Manhattan’s
Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village are in talks with a group
of investors led by Bill Ackman to buy its share of junior
debt on the property, according to people with knowledge of the
negotiations.  CWCapital, the special servicer representing holders of the
$3 billion mortgage on the 80-acre apartment complex, are
considering a purchase of $300 million of mezzanine or junior
debt owned by Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management and
Winthrop Realty Trust, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. Pershing and
Winthrop’s joint venture, PSW LLC, bought the debt for $45
million in August, or 15 cents on the dollar, and is seeking to
sell it for that price or more, according to one of the people.  A deal could be reached as early as tomorrow, the people
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
