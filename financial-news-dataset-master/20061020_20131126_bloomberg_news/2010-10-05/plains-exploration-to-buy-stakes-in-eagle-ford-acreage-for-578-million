Plains Exploration & Production Co. ,
the U.S. oil and gas producer that’s selling offshore assets,
agreed to buy stakes in properties in the Eagle Ford formation
of south Texas for $578 million to boost oil output.  The purchase will add production equivalent to about 5,000
barrels of oil a day as of the end of 2011, Houston-based  Plains 
said today in a statement. Sellers included closely held Dan A.
Hughes Co. of Beeville, Texas, and Houston American Energy
Corp., those companies said. Plains said its third-quarter sales
averaged an estimated 89,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up
about 5 percent from its second-quarter total.  Plains is tightening its focus on onshore oil wells after
an expansion push in natural gas turned out to be a “bust,”
Chief Executive Officer  James C. Flores  told investors on a
conference call. The purchase announced today will ensure that
oil and gas liquids, which sell at a premium to dry natural gas,
account for 50 percent to 60 percent of production, he said.  At current market prices, oil is about 3.6 times as
valuable as dry gas, relative to the energy content of the two
commodities.  Plains rose $1.53, or 5.9 percent, to $27.45 at 2:100 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  stock  had
dropped 6.3 percent this year before today.  Houston American 
climbed 5.3 percent to $11.25.  ‘Rotation’ From Gulf  Plains on Sept. 20 announced the sale of its stakes in some
of the largest U.S. offshore oil discoveries in the past decade
for $818 million. The company has additional offshore assets to
sell and will keep open a so-called data room for prospective
buyers until at least Oct. 15, Flores said. Gulf of Mexico
divestitures will total as much as $2.8 billion, he said.  “The whole rotation out of the Gulf of Mexico is going to
be a great transaction for us to use as much of that capital to
strengthen our balance sheet,” Flores said on the conference
call.  Most of the assets  Plains  is buying are located in Karnes
County, Texas, according to the statement. About 20,400 of the
60,000 net acres included in the deal are in a joint operating
area where Plains partners with  EOG Resources Inc.   Plains will pay $1.65 million for a 2.5 percent working
interest in 6,000 acres in the county, Houston American said
today in a statement.  Dan A. Hughes Jr ., president of Hughes,
said Plains is buying “prime” acreage from his company.  Plains said it expects to complete more than 25 wells next
year in the Granite Wash formation in the Texas Panhandle, up
from an Aug. 5 target of more than 22. Granite Wash is rich in
gas liquids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
