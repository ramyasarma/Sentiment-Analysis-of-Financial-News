U.S. stocks climbed, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since May,
after American service industries expanded more than forecast
and speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will join Japan’s
efforts to stoke economic growth.  Boeing Co. , Bank of America Corp. and DuPont Co. rose more
than 3 percent, leading gains in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average following the Institute for Supply Management’s report
and the Bank of Japan’s announcement that it will cut rates and
buy bonds. Banks rallied as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said they will
likely beat third-quarter profit estimates.  Chevron Corp.  rose
2.6 percent after the oil company said it will buy back stock.  The  S&P 500  rallied 2.1 percent, the most since Sept. 24,
to 1,160.75 at 4 p.m. in New York. The index must gain 0.4
percent to reach its level on May 5, the day before the 20-
minute crash that briefly erased $862 billion from the value of
U.S. shares. The  Dow  advanced 193.45 points, or 1.8 percent, to
10,944.72. Both measures reached the highest levels since May.  “Investors are voting they’re a little more comfortable
with the business outlook,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps
oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. “Investors are trying to get out of currencies and
into anything else that will retain wealth while monetary
authorities try to bludgeon currencies down.”  ‘Virtually Zero’  Stocks extended gains and the  Dollar Index  fell after the
ISM  gauge , which covers 90 percent of the world’s largest
economy, rose to 53.2 from 51.5. The  median economist forecast 
called for a reading of 52, according to Bloomberg data.
Equities surged worldwide after the Bank of Japan decided to cut
its interest rate to “virtually zero” and create a fund to buy
bonds and other assets to stoke the economy.  Boeing gained 3.4 percent to $68.60. Bank of America
climbed 3.1 percent to $13.56. DuPont rose 3 percent to $45.77.  Banks posted the biggest advance among 24 groups in the S&P
500, rising 3.2 percent. JPMorgan said the industry will top
estimates because of strong sales of mortgage loans and higher
net interest income.  Marshall & Ilsley Corp. jumped 5.9 percent to $7.53. Zions
Bancorporation advanced 3.6 percent to $21.91.  Citigroup Inc .
climbed 2.5 percent to $4.13. Bank of America Corp. increased
3.1 percent to $13.56.  Chevron gained 2.6 percent to $83.39. The company said it
will buy $500 million to $1 billion of stock each quarter.  More Sales  Harley-Davidson Inc.  surged 9.1 percent to $32.09 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The biggest U.S. motorcycle maker
had its share-price estimate increased to $36 from $33 by RBC
Capital Markets, which said the company’s U.S. retail sales
increased in September after falling the previous four months.  Apple Inc. climbed 3.7 percent to $288.94. Jefferies Group
Inc. gave the company a “buy” recommendation in new coverage,
the 48th positive recommendation among 51  analyst  calls tracked
by Bloomberg. The maker of Mac computers, iPhones and iPad table
devices is “vastly underestimated,” analyst  Peter Misek  wrote
in a report.  Misek gave the shares a price estimate of $365. The stock
has the most positive recommendations among 1,657 companies in
the MSCI World Index. There are no “sell” ratings on Apple,
Bloomberg data show, while three brokerages rate the shares as
“hold.”  Google Inc.  rose 3 percent to $538.23. The online search
company’s Android software has become the most popular operating
system in the U.S. among new smartphone buyers, topping Apple’s
iPhone and Research In Motion Ltd.’s BlackBerry, according to
Nielsen Co.  Missing Estimates  Iron Mountain Inc.  fell the most in the S&P 500, dropping
8.6 percent to $20.45. The information management company
forecast 2011 earnings excluding some items of $1.26 a share at
most, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.31 in a
Bloomberg survey.  American Express Co. declined the most in the Dow, slipping
2 percent to $38.28 after slumping 6.5 percent yesterday
following its decision to fight a U.S. antitrust complaint.
Larger rivals Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. settled the case,
agreeing to no longer bar merchants from steering customers to
alternative forms of payment.  Visa rallied 2.4 percent to $74.99 today, while MasterCard
increased 1.5 percent to $225.90.  Convertible Debt  Convertible securities are beating the U.S. corporate bond
market by the most in more than 10 years as investors wager
stocks will outperform company debt paying record-low yields.
Debentures that can be exchanged for shares returned 4.42
percentage points more than company bonds in September, the
biggest gap since August 2000, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  Investors are seeking to profit from the rally in equities
by buying convertible bonds, which are deemed safer than stocks
should the economy slip back into recession. Junk bond prices
are above par for the first time since 2007 and the S&P 500
trades at 15 times the past 12 months’ earnings, a 28 percent
 discount  based on its 20-year average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
