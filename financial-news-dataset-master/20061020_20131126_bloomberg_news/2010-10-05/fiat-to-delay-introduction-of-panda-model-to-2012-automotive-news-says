Fiat SpA will further delay the
introduction of its third-generation Panda until January 2012,
Automotive News reported, citing company sources it didn’t
identify. The launch, originally due this summer, had already
been postponed until September 2011 in a spending freeze ordered
by Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne, Automotive News
said. Other models that will be further delayed include the
Lancia Ypsilon subcompact and two minivans to replace the Fiat
Musa and Multipla, which will enter production in the second
half of 2012, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
