Venezuela reported the slowest
monthly inflation of the year in September, according to the
central bank’s Caracas price index.  Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in September from August,
down from 1.4 percent a month earlier, the bank said in an e-
mailed report today. Last month’s reading trailed the 1.8
percent median forecast of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation slowed to 27.9 percent from 30
percent a month earlier, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
