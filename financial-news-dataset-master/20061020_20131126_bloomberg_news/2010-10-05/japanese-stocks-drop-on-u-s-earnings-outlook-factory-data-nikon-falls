Japanese  stocks  climbed, reversing
losses after the Bank of Japan said it will cut its benchmark
interest rate and increase purchases of bonds to combat
deflation and stimulate the economy. The yen weakened.  Fanuc Ltd., Japan’s largest maker of industrial robots,
gained 2 percent.  Sony Corp. , the maker of Bravia televisions,
rose 1.4 percent. Tokyo Electron Ltd., the world’s second-
largest semiconductor-equipment maker, jumped 4 percent as
orders increased.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.5 percent to 9,518.76
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, after falling as much as 0.5
percent. The broader Topix index climbed 1.2 percent to 832.64.
The Nikkei 225’s move from today’s low to high was the widest
since Sept. 15, when the government said it intervened in the
foreign-exchange market to weaken the currency for the first
time since 2004.  “The BOJ’s decision was a surprise and that flipped the
market,” said  Hideo Arimura , who helps oversee $2.2 billion at
Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The decision shows the
central bank’s clear intention to end deflation.”  The yen weakened after the Bank of Japan pledged to buy up
to 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) in government bonds and other
assets to bolster the nation’s slowing economic recovery. The
central bank also cut the benchmark interest rate to a range of
zero percent to 0.1 percent, from the previous 0.1 percent
target. It pledged to maintain that rate until the end of
deflation is in sight.  To contact the reporters on this story:
