Romanian wages dropped in August for
the second time this year after the government cut public sector
wages to meet  International Monetary Fund -agreed bailout
targets.  Net wages fell an annual 0.7 percent the Bucharest-based
 National Statistics Institute  said in an e-mail today.  The government, the biggest employer in the eastern
European country, cut the net wages of its 1.3 million workers
by 25 percent from July and also raised a value-added tax by 5
percentage points to 24 percent to reduce spending and help meet
a budget deficit target of 6.8 percent of gross domestic product
set for this year.  Romania is counting on the IMF, the European Union and
other international lenders for a 20 billion-euro ($27 billion)
package of loans to stay afloat amid a lingering recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
