Hong Kong’s government may propose
legal changes to encourage more investment funds to incorporate
in the city, the South China Morning Post said, Secretary for
Financial Services and the Treasury Chan Ka-keung.  Hong Kong law now requires mutual funds domiciled in the
city to set up a trustee, something not required in most
European jurisdictions, the Hong Kong-based English-language
newspaper reported today, citing an interview with Chan.  The government has consulted fund managers and is studying
how to implement their suggestions, the Post said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
