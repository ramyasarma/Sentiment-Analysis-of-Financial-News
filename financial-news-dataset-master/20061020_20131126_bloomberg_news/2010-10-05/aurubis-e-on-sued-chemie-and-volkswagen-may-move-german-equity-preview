German stocks advanced as a gain by
Bayer AG, the country’ biggest drugmaker, offset declines by 
E.ON AG  and  RWE AG , the largest utilities.  Bayer increased 1.4 percent and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
gained 1.6 percent as the shares of drugmakers and carmakers
climbed across Europe. E.ON and RWE lost 1 percent and 0.6
percent, respectively, after two brokerages cut their price
estimates for the utility companies.  The benchmark  DAX Index  rose 0.2 percent to 6,146.3 at
11:23 a.m. in Frankfurt, snapping the benchmark measure’s
longest losing streak since January 2009 after better-than-
estimated economic reports from the U.S. failed to ease concern
that the recovery was stalling. The measure rallied 4.4 percent
in the third quarter as investors speculated that the Federal
Reserve and other central banks would step in to provide more
stimulus for the ailing global recovery. The broader  HDAX Index 
also added 0.2 percent today.  Europe’s services and manufacturing industries grew at a
slower rate in September than a month earlier, London-based
Markit Economics said today. A composite index based on a survey
of euro-area purchasing managers in both industries declined to
54.1 from 56.2 in August, Markit said. A reading above 50 means
that the industries expanded. A measure of new business fell to
its lowest level since November.  Bayer  rose 1.4 percent to 51.96 euros.  BMW  jumped 1.6
percent to 48.99 euros. K+S AG, Europe’s largest potash
producer, advanced 0.5 percent to 43.59 euros. Mosaic Co., North
America’s second-largest fertilizer producer, reported yesterday
that it sold 1.7 million tons of potash in the first quarter,
compared with about 800,000 tons a year earlier.  E.ON, RWE Slide       E.ON  lost 1 percent to 21.16 euros, the shares’ fifth
straight decline. Germany’s largest utility was cut to
“underweight” from “neutral” at HSBC Holdings Plc. The
brokerage cited reduced earnings and dividend forecasts and said
that the utility could set medium-term targets at a presentation
on Nov. 10 that “ risk disappointing the market.” HSBC
maintained its “underweight” rating on  RWE , the country’s
second-biggest utility, while slashing its price estimate to 46
euros from 53 euros. RWE slid 0.6 percent to 48.97 euros.  Separately, JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its price estimate for
E.ON shares to 27 euros from 28.50 euros, and that of RWE to 55
euros from 62 euros. The bank said that increased electricity
generation capacity in Germany would mean lower profits for the
two utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
