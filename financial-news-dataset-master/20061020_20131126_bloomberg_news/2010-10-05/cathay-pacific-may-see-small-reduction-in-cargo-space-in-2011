Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. may see a
“small reduction” in cargo capacity in May to July next year
because of delays in receiving Boeing Co. 747-8 freighters.  The carrier will begin to get the new cargo planes from the
third quarter of next year, it said in an e-mailed reply to
Bloomberg questions today. It was due to receive five planes in
the first half. The carrier will get six planes next year and
four in 2012, it said.  The airline is also due to inject freigthers into a venture
with Air China Ltd. that is awaiting regulatory approval.  Cathay will adjust maintenance schedules and increase
aircraft utilization rates to offset any drop in capacity, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
