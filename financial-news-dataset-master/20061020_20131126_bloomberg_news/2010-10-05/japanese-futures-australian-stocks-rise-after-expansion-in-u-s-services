interest rate at “virtually zero” and to purchase more assets.  “The Bank of Japan’s action may accelerate movements
towards monetary easing globally,” said Hiroichi Nishi, general
manager of the equities division at Tokyo-based Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc. “Confidence grew that the global economy is on
a recovery track, and investors will likely put money back into
risk assets.”  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in

economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 52. Readings greater
