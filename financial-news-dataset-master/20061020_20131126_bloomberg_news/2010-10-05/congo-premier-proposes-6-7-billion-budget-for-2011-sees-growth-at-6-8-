Congolese  Prime Minister  Adolphe Muzito  proposed a budget of $6.7 billion for 2011 and said the
economy is expected to expand 6.8 percent, while inflation is
forecast to average 9.9 percent for the year.  Muzito submitted the proposals to parliament today in
Kinshasa, the capital, his office said in an e-mailed statement.
Three billion dollars of the budget will come from external
sources, the statement said.  Higher mineral prices may help Congo’s economy expand 6.1
percent this year, better than the 5.4 percent anticipated at
the beginning of the year, Muzito said last month. The Central
African nation holds 4 percent of global copper reserves, is
among the world’s largest producers of cobalt and industrial
diamonds, and is Africa’s largest producer of tin ore, according
to the U.S. Geological Survey’s website.  The International Monetary Fund said on Sept. 17 that the
country’s short-term economic outlook “has significantly
improved.” Congo is recovering from more than a decade and a
half of conflict that destroyed most of the country’s
infrastructure and left its economy in disarray.  The  Central Bank of Congo  has cut its benchmark interest
rate this year by almost 50 percentage points to 22 percent.
Annualized inflation was 7.5 percent as of Sept. 26, half the
average rate projected for the year by the central bank and down
from 45 percent at the end of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
