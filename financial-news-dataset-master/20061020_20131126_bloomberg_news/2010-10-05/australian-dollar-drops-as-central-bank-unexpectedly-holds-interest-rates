The Australian dollar weakened after
the central bank left interest rates unchanged at 4.5 percent, a
decision forecast by six of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  The so-called Aussie slid to 96 U.S. cents as of 2:32 p.m.
in Sydney from 96.69 cents before the Reserve Bank of Australia
announced its decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
