three weeks. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-
largest energy company by market value, increased 2.7 percent as

C$200 million ($197 million) as a money manager at Venable Park
Investment Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario.  The S&P/TSX  surged  9.5 percent last quarter, the biggest

zero” until deflation has ended and set up a 5 trillion yen
($60 billion) fund to buy government bonds and other assets.  Australian Rate  Also today, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its
benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent. Most economists in a
Bloomberg survey had expected the central bank to raise the
overnight cash rate target.  Stocks extended their gains after the Institute for Supply

by assets, advanced 2.2 percent to C$75.31.  Sino-Forest Corp., the largest Canada-based forestry
