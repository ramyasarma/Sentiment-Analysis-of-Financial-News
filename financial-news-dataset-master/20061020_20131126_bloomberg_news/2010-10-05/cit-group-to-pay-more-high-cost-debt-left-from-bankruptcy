CIT Group Inc. , the business lender
led by  John A. Thain , took a second step in two weeks toward
reducing high-cost debt by saying it will redeem notes that
carry interest rates of more than 10 percent.  Approximately $860 million of Series B second-lien notes
will be redeemed at 103.5 percent of the principal amount, the
company said today in a statement. The 10.25 percent notes
mature in 2015 and 2016, New York-based CIT said. The move is to
be completed Nov. 4 and will leave outstanding $750 million of
the series maturing in 2017. On Sept. 21 CIT said it was
redeeming $537 million of the series of notes maturing in 2013
and 2014.  CIT is shrinking its balance sheet while developing less
expensive sources of funds, including bank deposits, to help the
company recover from bankruptcy. Before emerging from court
protection in December, CIT relied on the short-term capital
markets, which dried up for the company after losses from bad
loans, including  subprime mortgages .  “We will continue to proactively improve our cost of
capital through repayment or refinancing with lower cost
funding,” Thain, the chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  The company’s debt was reduced by more than 20 percent to
$43.3 billion in the bankruptcy. It has since repaid or
refinanced $7.5 billion of first-lien debt. The latest Series B
redemption brings the two-week total to $1.4 billion.  CIT rose 49 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $40.71 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
