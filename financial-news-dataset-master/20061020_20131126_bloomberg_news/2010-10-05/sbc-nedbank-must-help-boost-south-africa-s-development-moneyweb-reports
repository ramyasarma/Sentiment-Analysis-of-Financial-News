South Africa’s National Treasury must
ensure that the proposed takeover of Nedbank Group Ltd. by HSBC
Holdings Plc supports the government’s priorities on job
creation, education and rural development, Moneyweb said, citing
Thaba Mufamadi, chairman of parliament’s standing commitee on
finance.  Banks operating in South Africa need to be “alive” to
the country’s development objectives, the Johannesburg-based
news service quoted Mufamadi as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
