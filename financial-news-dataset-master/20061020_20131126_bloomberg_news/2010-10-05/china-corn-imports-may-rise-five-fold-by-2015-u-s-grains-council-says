China, the world’s second-largest
corn consumer, probably will quintuple imports of the grain in
the next five years as demand increases for livestock feed,
according to the  U.S. Grains Council .  Imports next year may be 2 million to 3 million metric tons
and jump to 15 million by 2015, said  Thomas C. Dorr , the grain
council’s president and chief executive officer. Imports of
dried distillers grain, a corn-based byproduct of ethanol
production used as animal feed, may rise to 2.5 million to 3
million tons in 2010, Dorr said.  “It’s very evident that the demand for feed and livestock
production is growing” at a rate of 3 percent to 6 percent
annually, Dorr said today during a conference call with
reporters. “The demand growth for China will remain strong,”
including for use in corn-based starches and plastics, he said.  Industrial use of corn, including for adhesives, cleaners
and chemicals, may rise to 45 million tons this year, Dorr said,
citing U.S. Department of Agriculture  data .  China  imported  432,191 tons of corn in August, the Beijing-
based customs office said in an e-mailed report on Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
