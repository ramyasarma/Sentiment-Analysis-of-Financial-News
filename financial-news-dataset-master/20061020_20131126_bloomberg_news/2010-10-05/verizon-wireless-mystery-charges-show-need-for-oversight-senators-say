Verizon Wireless ’s admission it
billed customers for mistaken Internet access shows the need for
regulators to oversee mobile-telephone billing practices, three
Democratic U.S. senators said.  The Federal Communications Commission should “remain
committed to vigorous oversight,”  Amy Klobuchar  of Minnesota,
 John Kerry  of Massachusetts and  Mark Begich  of Alaska said today
in a letter to FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski  that was
distributed by e-mail.  The FCC is investigating  Verizon Wireless , the largest U.S.
wireless company, for charging 15 million customers “mystery”
fees for data use on their mobile phones.  The FCC began its investigation 10 months ago after
customers complained about the fees, the FCC said in a statement
Oct. 3. Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon Wireless has
reportedly put the amount of the overcharges at more than $50
million in the past two years, the commission said.  Verizon Wireless, owned by  Verizon Communications Inc . and
 Vodafone Group Plc , will give refunds to 15 million customers in
the next two months, the company said in a statement Oct. 3.
Most of the refunds will be $2 to $6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
