Bloomberg's Paul Allen reports on 
growing investor demand for art in Asia.  A jade seal of China’s 18th century Qianlong emperor is 
one of the star attractions at Sotheby’s 3,200-lot Hong Kong 
auction that may raise HK$1.6 billion ($210 million) in a test 
of Chinese demand for art. The seven-day marathon also includes 
cases of Chateau Lafite Rothschild; a 6.4 carat pink diamond; 
antiques; jewelry and paintings by masters including Chinese 
abstract painter Zao Wou-ki, New York-based Sotheby’s said.
