Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa
extended a national state of emergency today because of concerns
over security at the building that houses the South American
country’s congress, according to a statement.  The emergency, which was called after a police uprising
last week, will expire on Oct. 8, according to a decree
published today on the president’s website. Protesters took over
the congressional building for several hours last week during
the demonstrations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
