Corn and soybeans, little changed,
may drop as dry weather in the Midwest helped to accelerate the
pace of U.S. harvesting. Wheat dropped to trade near a two-month
low, capping the longest slump since December.  December-delivery corn lost as much as 1.4 percent to
$4.6475 a bushel in Chicago. The grain was little changed at
$4.7175 at 3:01 p.m. in Tokyo after touching $4.5425 yesterday,
the lowest level since Sept. 3. The contract lost 11 percent
last week, the biggest drop in eight months.  About 37 percent of the corn crop was harvested as of Oct.
3, from 27 percent a week earlier and an average of 28 percent
in the previous five years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said in a  report  yesterday. About 37 percent of soybeans were
harvested, from 17 percent a week ago and the past-five-year
average of 28 percent.  “We may see harvests accelerate further because of dry
weather forecast in the U.S. Midwest this week,” said
 Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst at Tokyo-based commodity broker
Central Shoji Co. The outlook for increasing U.S. stockpiles was
also keeping downward pressure on prices, he said.  Inventories  on Sept. 1 rose 2 percent to 1.708 billion
bushels from a year earlier, the USDA said on Sept. 30. That was
322 million bushels more than the agency’s Sept. 10 estimate.  The condition of the  corn  crop was rated 66 percent good or
excellent as of Oct. 3, unchanged from a week earlier, the USDA
said. An estimated 64 percent of soybeans were rated in the top
two categories, from 63 percent a week earlier.  Soybeans for November delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent
to $10.4975 a bushel, declining for a third day, before trading
unchanged at $10.54. The price touched $10.42 yesterday, the
lowest level since Sept. 17.  Winter Wheat  Wheat for December delivery dropped as much as 0.5 percent
to $6.44 a bushel, falling for a seventh day, the longest losing
streak since December. The contract traded at $6.465 after
touching $6.435 yesterday, the lowest level since July 30.  About 53 percent of the winter-wheat crop was planted as of
Oct. 3, compared with 33 percent on Sept. 26, and 54 percent a
year earlier, the USDA said. An estimated 22 percent of the
plants had emerged from the ground, up from 10 percent a week
earlier and the average of 25 percent in the prior five years.  Russia’s wheat production may plunge 33 percent this year
after the worst drought in 50 years slashed production, a USDA
unit said. Output will fall to 41.5 million metric tons in the
year that began July 1, from 61.7 million tons last year, the
USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said in a report yesterday.  The service’s estimate was less than an official U.S.
projection announced last month. Russian exports will slump 78
percent to 4.1 million tons, it said.  In export market, South Korean importers are seeking to buy
a total 275,000 tons of corn and in tenders today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
