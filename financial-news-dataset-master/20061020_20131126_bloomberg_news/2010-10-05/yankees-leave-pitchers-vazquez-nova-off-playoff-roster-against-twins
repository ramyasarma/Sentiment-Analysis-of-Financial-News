The New York Yankees left pitchers
 Javier Vazquez  and  Ivan Nova  off the roster for their
first-round playoff series against the Minnesota Twins.  Vazquez was 10-10 with a 5.32 earned run average this
season while making $11.5 million with the Yankees, who have
the highest payroll in Major League Baseball.  Joe Mauer  is the
only Minnesota player with a higher salary, at $12.5 million.  Nova, a rookie, made seven late-season starts for the
Yankees and went 1-2 with a 4.50 ERA. The Yankees also left
relief pitcher Chad Gaudin off their roster for the American
League Division Series.  CC Sabathia  will be the Yankees’ starting pitcher tomorrow
in Game 1 of the best-of-five series.  Andy Pettitte  and  Phil Hughes  will follow in the next two games, while  A.J. Burnett 
won’t be a part of the starting rotation,  ESPN reported , citing
a baseball official. Burnett is making $16.5 million as part of
his five-year, $82.5 million contract.  Burnett, Sabathia and Pettitte were the only pitchers to
start in the 2009 postseason for the Yankees, who became the
first team since the 1991 Twins to win the World Series using
just three starters during the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
