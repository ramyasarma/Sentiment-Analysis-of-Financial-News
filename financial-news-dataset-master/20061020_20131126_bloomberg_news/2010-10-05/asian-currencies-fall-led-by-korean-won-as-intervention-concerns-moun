Asian currencies weakened, led by
South Korea’s won, on concern policy makers will intervene to
counter appreciation that may hurt exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, extended
yesterday’s retreat from a two-year high and was 0.1 percent
lower as of 4:23 p.m. in Hong Kong. The won dropped 0.7 percent
to 1,130.58 per dollar and Malaysia’s ringgit slid 0.2 percent
to 3.1010, extending yesterday’s retreat from a 13-year high.
India’s rupee declined 0.2 percent to 44.6525.  “Concern grew in the market about intervention and this
also triggered some profit-taking,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a
global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Funds are
still flowing into developing Asia, whose economies are in
better condition than the U.S. and Japan. The basic trend
remains for regional currencies to rise and moves such as
today’s are likely to prove temporary.”  The Asia Dollar Index jumped 2.6 percent in September, the
most since March 2009, as stock markets in India, South Korea
and Taiwan attracted some $13 billion from abroad. Foreigners
pumped $1 billion more into Korean equities in the first two
trading days of October and today bought more of the securities
than they sold for a 15th day.  Korea Audits  South Korea’s government said today that banks involved in
foreign-exchange transactions will face audits, having yesterday
issued a report saying it will “try to keep the currency from
moving sharply due to herd behavior.” The nation’s foreign-
exchange reserves rose $4.4 billion to a record $289.8 billion
in September, when the won jumped 5.1 percent, according to
central bank data released yesterday.  Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said
today action would be taken if capital flows prove disruptive.
In Thailand, central bank Director Wongwatoo Potirat said the
bank is still studying measures to help manage the appreciation
of the baht, though the use of additional policy tools must be
considered “carefully.”  Bank Negara Malaysia said on Aug. 24 that it “will be
there” when there are excessive and sudden moves in the
foreign-exchange market, while Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin
Nasution said Sept. 17 any purchases of the U.S. currency would
aim to “prevent the rupiah’s fluctuations from becoming too
big.” Philippine Finance Secretary  Cesar Purisima  said Sept. 28
the central bank intervenes “when there are unusual
fluctuations.”  Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 8,940, trimming
this year’s advance to 5 percent. The Philippine peso traded at
43.765 from 43.755 yesterday when it touched a two-year high of
43.66.  Taiwan Intervention  Taiwan’s dollar erased its gains in the final minute of
trading on suspected intervention by the central bank. The local
dollar settled at NT$31.252 in Taipei, after rising as much as
0.7 percent from yesterday’s close of NT$31.250.  It strengthened yesterday beyond NT$31 for the first time
since August 2008, before erasing most of its gains because of
suspected intervention. The central bank may have sold NT$20
billion ($643 million) or more for U.S. dollars to curb the
currency’s rise, the Economic Daily News reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  The island’s foreign reserves jumped $8.4 billion in
September to a record $380.5 billion, the biggest increase in 11
months, the Central Bank of China (Taiwan) reported today.  Elsewhere, the Singapore dollar was little changed at
S$1.3143. China’s financial markets were closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
