Yum! Brands Inc. , the owner of the
KFC and Taco Bell restaurant chains, said third-quarter profit
gained 6.9 percent, as declining U.S. operating profit dampened
growth in China.  Net income  climbed to $357 million, or 74 cents a share,
the Louisville, Kentucky-based company said in a statement
today. Excluding some items, profit of 73 cents matched the
average of analysts’  projections  compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. operating profit declined 2 percent, or $3 million,
because of employee costs and legal expenses, the company said.
Operating profit increased 23 percent in China, and 16 percent
in the company’s international division.  “It was a respectable quarter, but you’d like to see
earnings contribution from all the different areas of the
world,”  Jack Russo , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. in St.
Louis, said in a telephone interview.  Yum increased its 2010 earnings guidance to $2.48 a share
from $2.43. Analysts project the company will earn $2.48 a share
in 2010, according to an average of 17 estimates.  Sales at stores open at least a year increased 6 percent in
China, which accounted for 34 percent of revenue last year. The
company opened 90 restaurants in the country during the quarter.
Overall, Yum’s sales rose 3 percent to $2.86 billion.  Yum  rose 5 cents to $46.85 at 5:20 p.m. in after-hours
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier today, the
shares increased 38 cents to close at $46.80. They have gained
34 percent this year.  Franchisees Sue  Yum  reported  net income of $334 million, or 69 cents a
share, in last year’s third quarter.  U.S. franchisees of KFC, known for its fried chicken, have
sued Yum, seeking increased control over the brand’s advertising
following its introduction of grilled products. KFC President
 Roger Eaton  told a judge on Sept. 23 that it would be
“disastrous” for the brand if the franchisees won and would
slow its decision-making ability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
