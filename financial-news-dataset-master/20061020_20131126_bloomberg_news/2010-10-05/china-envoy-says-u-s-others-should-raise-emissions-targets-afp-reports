The United States and other developed
nations should raise their targets for cutting greenhouse gas
emission, Agence France-Presse said, citing Su Wei, China’s
chief negotiator on climate change.  Targets set by developed nations don’t meet the
expectations of developing countries, and should be increased
“dramatically,” Su said, according to AFP. The failure of the
United Nations climate talks is due to the reluctance of
developed nations to act, AFP said, citing Su.  China wants the targets to be discussed as part
of the negotiations for the climate change summit in Cancun,
Mexico, next month, AFP said.  -- Alfred Cang  in Shanghai. Editor:  Tan Hwee Ann   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
