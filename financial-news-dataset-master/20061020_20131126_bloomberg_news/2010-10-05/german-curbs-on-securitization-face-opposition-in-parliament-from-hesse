A German bill that makes
securitization more costly than in other European Union
countries faces opposition at a parliamentary session today on
concern it would make it harder for companies to raise money.  The measure, passed by lawmakers of Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition on July 8, lets financial companies invest in
securitizations only if the sellers keep at least 10 percent of
the risk on their books. An EU directive calls for originators
to retain a risk of at least 5 percent.  Hesse, the state where  Frankfurt , Germany’s financial
center, is located, is co-sponsoring a measure due for a vote in
the federal parliament’s reconciliation committee today that
sets the rate at 5 percent. If the measure passes, Merkel’s
coalition can reject it with its  majority  in the lower house.  “Functioning and liquid securitization markets are
indispensable for avoiding future credit squeezes,” as they
help small and mid-size companies and property developers raise
capital, said the measure backed by Hesse and Lower Saxony in
the upper house, or Bundesrat, where German state governments
are represented.  The bill is a response to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis
that set off the financial crisis and a global recession. To
avoid disadvantages for Germany’s financial industry, the 5
percent retention will be effective for two years before the 10
percent rate takes effect, according to the draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
