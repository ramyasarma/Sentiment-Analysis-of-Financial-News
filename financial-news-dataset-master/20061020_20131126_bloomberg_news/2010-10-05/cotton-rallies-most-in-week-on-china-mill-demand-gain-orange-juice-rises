Cotton futures rose the most in a
week as demand increased at textile mills in China, the world’s
biggest consumer. Orange juice gained.  U.S. export sales of upland cotton in the week ended Sept.
23 jumped 54 percent to 780,045 bales from a week earlier,
Department of Agriculture data show. China accounted for 42
percent of the total, the most of any country. Prices for the
fiber have jumped 60 percent in the past year. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “China has continued to buy this week,” said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana.  Cotton for December delivery rose 0.73 cent, or 0.7
percent, to settle at 98.56 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since Sept. 28.  “In China, as the cotton harvest gets delayed due to wet
weather, it is auctioning incrementally more cotton from its
reserves to calm domestic prices,” Macquarie Group Ltd. said
today in a research note.  Last week, the fiber fell 1.9 percent, the most since July.
Merchant and mill buying rebounded on the dip, Stevens said.  “We’re establishing a trading range,” said Stevens, who
said prices may reach about $1.01 this week. Futures touched
$1.004 earlier today.  World Cotton Output  World output will increase 16 percent to 25.2 million
metric tons in the year that started Aug. 1, from 21.8 million
last year, the International Cotton Advisory Committee said last
week. The USDA will update its estimates for U.S. and world
production and usage on Oct. 8.  Crop conditions in the U.S. improved in the week ended Oct.
3, with 56 percent of cotton rated good or excellent, up from 55
percent a week earlier and 47 percent a year earlier, the USDA
said yesterday.  Orange-juice futures rose to the highest level in almost
two weeks on expectations for a smaller crop in Brazil, the
world’s largest grower, because of drought.  Output in the country’s citrus belt may drop to 271.7
million boxes from 305 million last year, Sucocitrico Cutrale
Ltda. Corporate Affairs Director  Carlos Viacava  said last month.
Cutrale makes about 30 percent of global orange-juice supplies.  “If Brazil’s crop size is lower, exporting out of the U.S.
will be stronger,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld
Futures in Tampa, Florida.  A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery advanced 3.85
cents, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $1.585 a pound at 2 p.m. on
ICE, after falling for two straight sessions. Earlier, the price
touched $1.64, the highest level since Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
