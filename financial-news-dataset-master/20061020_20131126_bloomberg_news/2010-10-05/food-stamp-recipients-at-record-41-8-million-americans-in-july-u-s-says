The number of Americans receiving
food stamps rose to a record 41.8 million in July as the  jobless
rate  hovered near a 27-year high, the government said.  Recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
subsidies for food purchases jumped 18 percent from a year
earlier and increased 1.4 percent from June, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said today in a  statement  on its website.
Participation has set records for 20 straight months.  Unemployment in September may have reached 9.7 percent,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts in advance of
the release of last month’s rate on Oct. 8.  Unemployment  was 9.6
percent in July, near levels last seen in 1983.  An average of 43.3 million people, more than an eighth of
the population, will get food stamps each month in the year that
began Oct. 1, according to White House estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
