Wells Fargo & Co. , the biggest U.S.
home lender, said it opted against joining some other banks in
delaying foreclosures as it stands by statements made to courts.  “Our affidavit procedures and daily auditing demonstrate
that our foreclosure affidavits are accurate,” the San
Francisco-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  The bank’s decision to proceed with foreclosures contrasts
with competitors including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase & Co., which said last week that they are delaying court
proceedings pending internal reviews. Ally Financial Inc. said
last month its GMAC Mortgage unit would halt evictions.  Wells Fargo conducts daily audits of its foreclosure
process, and when it finds an error, employees “take action,”
according to the statement. Through June, 92 percent of Wells
Fargo’s mortgages were current, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
