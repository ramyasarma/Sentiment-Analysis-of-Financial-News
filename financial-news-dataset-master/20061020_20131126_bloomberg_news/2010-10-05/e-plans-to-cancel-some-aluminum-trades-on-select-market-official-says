The London Metal Exchange plans to
cancel some aluminum trades made on its Select electronic
trading system at 1 a.m. local time, a bourse official said.  The cancelation covers 220 lots of the three-month contract
traded in a 21 second period after the open, the official from
the bourse’s help desk said by phone. One lot is equal to 25
metric tons of metal. Aluminum fell as much as 3.3 percent to
$2,286 a ton at the open, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Stephen White, a spokesman for the exchange, didn’t
immediately respond to a voicemail left on his mobile phone
seeking comment, outside of normal business hours.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
