One hundred publicly traded
biotechnology companies in the U.S. have been acquired or ceased
operations since the end of 2007, a 25 percent drop in the
number of active companies, a report said.  Companies have struggled to raise funds from public
offerings and acquisitions haven’t filled the void, said John
Craighead, managing director for investor relations and business
development of the  Biotechnology Industry Organization , a
Washington-based trade group. While acquisitions of biotech
companies grew to 55 in 2008 from 40 in 2007, the number fell to
38 last year and to 21 so far this year, Craighead said.  The estimated 294 public companies that remain in the
biotechnology industry are in a better cash position than they
were at the end of 2008, when 45 percent of companies had less
than a year’s worth of funds available. Today, only 25 percent
of companies have such limited resources, according to data
released today by BIO.  “The biotech industry is significantly smaller than it was
three years ago,” Craighead said during a presentation at the
group’s annual investor meeting in San Francisco.  Since August 2009, 13 biotechnology companies have  gone
public  and the share prices of 12 of the companies fell by an
average of 20 percent once they began trading, Craighead said.
The offerings were priced 30 percent below the company’s initial
goals, he said.  Among surviving publicly traded companies with at least one
year of cash, 40 percent have cut staff, 11 percent have issued
debt and 7 percent have sold assets, Craighead said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
