Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said the region
failed to overcome a split with China over the yuan’s
appreciation.   “There’s a divergence of analysis between the Chinese
authorities and the European authorities,” Juncker told
reporters today in Brussels after meeting with Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao. “We think the Chinese currency is broadly
undervalued.”  Juncker said Wen promised more exchange-rate flexibility
without giving a timetable. China in June eased the yuan’s two-
year peg against the dollar.   “The Chinese prime minister today indicated that there
will be a greater flexibility of the Chinese currency during the
course of the period to come,” Juncker said. “We will continue
our debate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
