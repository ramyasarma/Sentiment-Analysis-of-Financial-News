South Korea will cut tariffs on some
vegetables and necessities this year to help stabilize local
consumer prices that rose the most in 17 months in September.  The government will reduce to zero tariffs on napa cabbages
and radishes, the main ingredients of Kimchi, from around Oct.
14 until the end of this year, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement today. It will also apply a lower tax on more garlic
imports than it does currently.  Inflation  accelerated to 3.6 percent last month, the
fastest pace since March 2009, bolstering the case for the
central bank to raise borrowing costs further. The Bank of Korea
joined counterparts from Australia to New Zealand last month in
keeping interest rates unchanged to assess the strength of the
global economic recovery, after raising them earlier.  The country will also reduce tariffs on tires, detergents,
multivitamins, hair and bath products, toilet soaps, cosmetics
and perfumes, according to the statement.  The Bank of Korea aims to keep inflation at between 2
percent and 4 percent on average through 2012. It left the
benchmark interest rate at 2.25 percent in August and September,
following a 0.25 percentage point increase in July from 2
percent. That move was the first advance since the global
financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
