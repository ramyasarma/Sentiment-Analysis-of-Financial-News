Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., the
United Arab Emirates state-owned company, raised September oil
prices for a second month ahead of next week’s meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Murban, a high-sulfur grade, was set at a four-month high
of $75.90 a barrel, up about 2 percent from August, Adnoc, as
the company is known, said in an e-mailed document today. Lower
Zakum was increased to $75.65, Umm Shaif to $75.50 and Upper
Zakum to $74, according to the document.  Abu Dhabi is the capital and main oil-resource holder in
the U.A.E., the third-largest OPEC producer, which pumped 2.31
million barrels of crude last month, based on a Bloomberg News
survey. OPEC’s 12 members, responsible for about 40 percent of
global oil supply, are scheduled to discuss policy Oct. 14 in
Vienna.  Benchmark crude futures in New York fell today from an
eight-week high near $81 a barrel, after surging 11 percent in
September, the most since May 2009. Oil in the $70-to-$80 range
is “as close to perfect as possible,” Saudi Arabian Oil
Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said in April and  King Abdullah  has
targeted $75 as a fair price for consumers and producers. The
kingdom is the biggest OPEC producer.  Abu Dhabi announces official selling prices retroactively,
meaning crude lifted the previous month is set based on market
conditions, demand, and producer and exchange prices. Producers
including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait announce price formulas as a
premium or discount to a benchmark to determine the cost of oil
sold in forward months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
