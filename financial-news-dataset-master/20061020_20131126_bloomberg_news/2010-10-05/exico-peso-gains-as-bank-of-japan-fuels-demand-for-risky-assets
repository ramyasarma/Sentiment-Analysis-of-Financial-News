Mexico’s peso rose to the strongest
level since May as the Bank of Japan eased monetary policy to
spur economic growth, fueling demand for riskier emerging-market
assets.  The peso increased 0.9 percent to 12.4753 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.5921 yesterday, the strongest level
against the dollar since May 13. The currency has risen 5
percent against the dollar this year.  The Bank of Japan’s move “reinforces the outlook for high-
yield currencies,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , emerging
markets strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford,
Connecticut. “There is more space for the peso to go without
having to worry about the central bank intervening.”  The Bank of Japan promised to keep its benchmark interest
rate at “virtually zero” and increase its purchase of
government bonds and other assets to boost the economy.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.397 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.68 centavo to 133.51 centavos on the peso.  Traders triggered $400 million of dollar options today, the
central bank said on its website.  The bank has been selling $600 million of dollar options
monthly, allowing it to purchase dollars as it seeks to boost
foreign reserves after the peso reached a record low last year.
Foreign reserves reached a record high $108 billion as of Oct.
1, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Mexico plans to sell $1 billion of bonds due in 100 years
to yield 6.1 percent as soon as today, the longest-maturity debt
issued by a Latin American country, a person familiar with the
transaction said.  Mexican government-regulated pension funds, the nation’s
biggest institutional investors, had 1.38 trillion pesos under
management in September, the regulator known as Consar said in a
statement today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
