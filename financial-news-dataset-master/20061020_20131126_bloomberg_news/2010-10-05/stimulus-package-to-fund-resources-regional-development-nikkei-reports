Japan’s economic stimulus package
will include 100 billion yen in spending to help reduce the
nation’s reliance on China for rare-earth metals, Nikkei English
News said, without citing anyone.     The package will also include an additional 25 billion yen
for Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp., and more than 300
billion yen for a regional revitalization fund, the report said.
The government also plans to invest several trillion yen from a
special account for foreign exchange funds in overseas resource
projects, the report said.   About 500 billion yen in financial support for small
businesses will be provided through credit guarantee
associations, the Nikkei said. The stimulus package will include
incentives to promote the use of solar-power systems, high-
efficiency boilers and low-flow toilets in households, the
report said.  The government doesn’t plan to issue bonds to finance the
4.8 trillion yen stimulus package, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
