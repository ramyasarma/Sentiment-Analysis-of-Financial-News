Prices for installed solar power
equipment have fallen 13 percent this year in Germany, helped by
efficiency improvements and investments in panel manufacturing,
the BSW solar industry association said.  Should prices continue to fall at the same pace, by 2012
electricity produced on residential roofs will cost the same as
traditional power plants owned by utilities, the association
said in an e-mailed statement.  Germany will probably install a total of 8 gigawatts of
solar panels this year, the BSW said. The industry is racing to
lower prices to match reductions in guaranteed, above-market
rates for electricity generated from the sun using photovoltaic
equipment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
