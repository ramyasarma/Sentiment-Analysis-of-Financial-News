Mongolian Mining Corp. , the country’s
biggest closely held coking coal producer, raised
HK$5.05 billion ($651 million) in a Hong Kong initial public
offering, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Mongolian Mining and shareholders sold 719.4 million shares,
or about 20 percent of the Ulaanbaatar-based company, at
HK$7.02 apiece, said the person, who declined to be identified
before a public announcement. The final price was at the
mid-point of a revised HK$6.48 to HK$7.56 range, according to
Mongolian Mining’s IPO prospectus.  The IPO is the biggest on record by a company from the
landlocked Asian nation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
going back to 1999. Mongolian Mining is raising funds to tap
rising import demand for steelmaking coal from China, the
world’s biggest producer of the metal.  The final price values the company at 12.6 times 2011
earnings as estimated by banks involved in the sale, said the
person.  Citigroup Inc.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  are managing
Mongolian Mining’s IPO, the prospectus said.  Mongolian Mining and its investors had initially offered
the shares at HK$6.29 to HK$7.34 apiece, according to sale terms
e-mailed to investors on Sept. 20.  IPO Proceeds  Of the IPO proceeds, about 50 percent will be used to
improve transport links and infrastructure, while 40 percent
will go toward acquisitions, the prospectus said.  Mongolian Mining is based in the Tavan Tolgoi area, south
of Ulaanbaatar and about 240 kilometers (149 miles) from the
border with China. Tavan Tolgoi holds about 6 billion metric
tons of coal in the deserts of southern Mongolia, making it one
of the world’s largest unexploited reserves of the fuel.  Production at the company’s pit at Ukhaa Khudag was 1.8
million tons in 2009 and will likely rise to 3.8 million tons
this year, Chief Executive Officer Battsengel Gotov said Sept.
27. The company plans to raise production to 15 million tons a
year by 2013 to meet increasing demand for coking coal among
China’s steelmakers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
