CB Richard Ellis Group Inc ., the
world’s largest commercial property broker, fired six employees
in China after discovering improper payments to local
governmental officials.  The finding was made during an internal investigation CB
Richard Ellis began in the first quarter, the Los Angeles-based
broker said in  a regulatory filing  today. The company
voluntarily disclosed the information to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice and is
cooperating with both, it said.  The payments are “minor” in amount and relate to “a few
discrete transactions involving immaterial revenues,” the
company said in the filing. They included payments for non-
business entertainment and gifts. The six employees were fired
for their involvement, according to a separate statement today.  “We have also taken actions to strengthen our policies and
controls in China around compliance with the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws,” the company said in
the e-mailed statement.  CB Richard Ellis  began another internal investigation in
the third quarter involving “the use of a third party agent”
in connection with the 2008 purchase of an investment property
in China for a fund it manages, the broker said. The Justice
Department and SEC were also notified of this investigation,
which is ongoing, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
