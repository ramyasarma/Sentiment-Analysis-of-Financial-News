Assicurazioni Generali SpA , Italy’s
biggest insurer, had the outlook on its ratings raised at Fitch
because of “improved capital adequacy and resilience to adverse
trading conditions.”  “The revision of the rating outlooks reflects Generali’s
improved capital adequacy through retained 2009 earnings and the
consolidation at this level in the course of 2010,” Fitch said
in a report today. The outlook on the AA- long-term issuer
default rating was lifted to “stable” from “negative.”  Chief Executive Officer  Giovanni Perissinotto  expects to
report higher operating margins and a rise in profit this year,
he said Aug. 5. The company is expanding in emerging markets in
Asia, the Middle East and eastern Europe.  The insurer, due to release third-quarter figures on Nov.
11, also passed a euro-zone sovereign-risk stress test as
calculated by Fitch. “Generali should be able to withstand
deterioration of the credit quality of certain sovereigns and
sharp changes in market values,” the firm said  The Trieste, Italy-based insurer rose as much as 1.8
percent, and was up 1.5 percent at 14.52 euros as of 3:40 p.m.
local time, giving the company a market value of 22.6 billion
euros ($31.2 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
