Aeroports de Paris, operator of the
French capital’s Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, said it
plans to increase earnings before interest, taxes, deprecation
and amortization by 40 percent from 2009 and 2015.  The target was given in a statement on Business Wire before
an investor day today. The goal rests on the assumption that
traffic will be flat this year, before increasing by 2.0 percent
in 2011, 2.4 percent in 2012 and by 3.9 percent a year from 2013
to 2015, ADP said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
