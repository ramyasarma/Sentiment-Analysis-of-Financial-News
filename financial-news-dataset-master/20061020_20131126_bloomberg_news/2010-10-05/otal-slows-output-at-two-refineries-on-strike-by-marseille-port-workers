Total SA , Europe’s largest oil
refiner, slowed “activity” at two plants in the south of
France because of a strike by workers at the port of Marseille
that’s preventing ships from docking and delivering crude.  The company “has taken measures to save crude oil by
slowing down the level at which refinery units are running,”
 Michael Crochet-Vourey , a Total spokesman, said today by phone
from Paris.  Total’s La Mede refinery has the capacity to process
157,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its Feyzin plant, which also relies on crude supplies
from the port, can handle 115,000 barrels a day.  The Marseille workers strike started on Sept. 27 in a
protest over the port’s reform and government plans to raise the
age of retirement.  “There’s no real impact or disruption for the moment,”
Catherine Brun, an Exxon Mobil Corp. spokeswoman, said by mobile
phone, referring to the company’s Fos refinery on France’s
southern coast.  Ineos Group Holdings Plc and LyondellBasell Industries BV
also have plants in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
