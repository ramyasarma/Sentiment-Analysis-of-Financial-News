Paranapanema SA , a Brazilian copper
producer, gained the most in a year in Sao Paulo trading on
speculation  Vale SA  will make a higher offer for the company
after failing to buy it last month.  Paranapanema jumped 9.8 percent, the most since September
2009, to 6.30 reais as of the 4 p.m. New York time close.  Shareholders representing a majority of the common stock
rejected a Sept. 1 bid of 6.75 reais a share from Vale, even
after the world’s largest iron-ore producer increased its offer
four times during an auction. O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper
reported today, without saying where it obtained the
information, that Vale may almost double its 2011 investment
plan to as much as $25 billion.  “People are thinking Vale’s going to make a new offer for
the company,” said  Pedro Galdi , an analyst at SLW Corretora in
Sao Paulo.  Vale gained 1.2 percent to 47.34 reais as copper rose to
the highest price in 26 months. A Vale press official, who asked
not to be named because of company policy, declined to comment
on the Estado report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
