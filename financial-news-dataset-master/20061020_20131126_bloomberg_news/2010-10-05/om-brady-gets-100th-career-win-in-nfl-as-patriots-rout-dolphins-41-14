Tom Brady  got his 100th career win in
fewer games than any National Football League quarterback as the
New England Patriots beat the Miami Dolphins 41-14.  The Patriots had four interceptions and scored five second-
half touchdowns last night at Sun Life Stadium in Miami to
improve to 3-1 on the season.  Brady, who’s led New England to three Super Bowl titles,
passed for 153 yards and a touchdown to boost his record to 100-
31 and become the 11th quarterback in NFL history with 100
victories. Hall of Famer  Joe Montana  was the previous fastest to
reach 100 wins, in his 139th career game.  “I’ve got a great team, a great organization,” Brady said
during a televised interview. “I’m truly privileged. Hopefully
there’s a lot more wins left. I’m excited to see what we’re all
about this year.”  Trailing 7-6 at halftime, the Patriots took the lead for
good when  Brandon Tate  returned the second-half kickoff 103
yards for a touchdown. It was the eighth kickoff return for a
score through the first four weeks of the regular season.  BenJarvus Green-Ellis  ran for a 12-yard touchdown just over
two minutes later to give the Patriots a 20-7 lead. After  Ricky Williams  caught a 28-yard touchdown pass to pull the Dolphins
within six points, Brady hooked up with  Danny Woodhead  for an
11-yard touchdown pass to put the Patriots up 27-14.  New England extended its lead less than a minute into the
fourth quarter as  Kyle Arrington  returned a blocked field goal
for a touchdown.  Patrick Chung , who had blocked the kick for the
Patriots, capped the scoring with a 51-yard interception return
for a touchdown with 6:30 left.  To contact the reporter on this story:
