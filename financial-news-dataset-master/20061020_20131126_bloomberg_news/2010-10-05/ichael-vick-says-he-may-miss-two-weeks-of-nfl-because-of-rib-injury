Michael Vick  said he could miss the
next two Philadelphia Eagles games because of a rib injury
suffered two days ago.  The quarterback, in an appearance last night on the  Bruce
Smith radio show  in Norfolk, Virginia, said he has cartilage
damage in his ribs and a small fracture. He said the most
effective treatment for the injury is rest.  “It won’t be no more than one, two weeks hopefully,” Vick
said in the radio interview. “I’ve always been a quick
healer.”  Eagles coach  Andy Reid  said yesterday that Vick’s
availability would be a “day-to-day, week-to-week” thing. The
Eagles (2-2) visit the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 10 and host
the Atlanta Falcons on Oct. 17.  “The most important thing is just rest,” Vick said,
according to the  Eagles’ website . “There is really nothing you
can do for a rib injury, especially in the upper part of your
rib cage.”  Vick, 30, was hurt on a running play late in the first
quarter of the 17-12 loss to the Washington Redskins on Oct. 3.
He didn’t return to the National Football League game after
getting sandwiched by Washington cornerback  DeAngelo Hall  and
safety  Kareem Moore  near the goal line.  Vick was replaced by  Kevin Kolb , who completed 22-of-35
passes for 201 yards, one touchdown and an interception.  Vick moved into the starting lineup after Kolb, 26,
suffered a concussion in a Week 1 loss to the  Green Bay Packers .
Vick then led the Eagles to wins over the  Detroit Lions  and
 Jacksonville Jaguars , throwing for six touchdowns and no
interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
