Enbridge Inc. ’s 2010 earnings will be
at the top of the company’s forecasted range, and cash payouts
at its U.S. partnership won’t be cut after a pair of pipeline
breaks in the Midwest.  The company’s 2010 full-year earnings will be in the upper
part of its C$2.50 ($2.45) to C$2.70 a share forecast, Chief
Executive Officer  Patrick Daniel  said today at the company’s
investor conference in Toronto. The company said cash
distributions at  Enbridge Energy Partners LP  won’t be hurt by
the cost of the spills. Enbridge is expected to earn C$2.68, the
average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg.  A break in the Calgary-based company’s Line 6B near
Marshall, Michigan, spilled about 19,500 barrels of oil into a
tributary of the Kalamazoo River July 26 and a leak in Line 6A
at Romeoville, Illinois, Sept. 9 spilled 6,100 barrels. Both
lines are back in service. Line 6B is running at a reduced rate.  “For a company that takes safety integrity and reliability
very seriously this experience has been very humbling for
Enbridge,” Daniel said. The company, which hauls most of the
output of Canada’s oil sands to refineries in the U.S., needs to
work to minimize the risk of pipeline operations, he said.  Monarch Pipeline  Enbridge said it may build a pipeline capable of carrying
350,000 barrels a day to Houston from Cushing, Oklahoma. The 24-
inch line, called Monarch, would help ease congestion at the
Oklahoma point, said  Stephen Wuori , president of Enbridge’s
liquids pipelines unit.  The company didn’t release an estimate of a completion date
or cost for the line. Enbridge rival TransCanada Corp. is
planning a similar service with its Keystone XL pipeline
expansion. That line would be in service in 2013 if it is
approved by regulators.  The company expects to pay as much as $60 million of the
estimated $460 million cost of the pipeline repairs and cleanup
in the two spills, with the rest covered by insurance. The
estimate doesn’t include fines related to the incidents.  The lines are both operated by Houston-based  Enbridge
Energy Partners , which is controlled by the Calgary company.  Wuori said the spills won’t impact the partnership’s
quarterly cash distribution. Enbridge Energy paid out $1.0275
per unit Aug. 13.  Enbridge rose 31 cents to C$54.50 as of 10:27 a.m. on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. Enbridge Energy Partners rose 28 cents
to C$57.33 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
