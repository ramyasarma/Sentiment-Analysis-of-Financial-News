U.S. federal investigators are
probing major drug companies over allegations of bribes paid in
countries such as Brazil and Saudi Arabia in order to boost
sales and accelerate product approval, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Justice Department are investigating companies such as Merck
& Co., AstraZeneca Plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb & Co. and
GlaxoSmithKline Plc for possible violations of the 1977 law
preventing companies with stock traded in the U.S. from bribing
foreign officials, the newspaper said.  SciClone Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co both said
they’d been subpoenaed, and Baxter International Inc. said it’s
also being probed; the investigations cover sales and operations
in Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Saudi
Arabia, the WSJ added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
