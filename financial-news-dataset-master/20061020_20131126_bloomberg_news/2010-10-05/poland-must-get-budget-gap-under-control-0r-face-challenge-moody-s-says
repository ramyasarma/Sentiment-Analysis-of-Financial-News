Unless Poland brings its budget
deficit under control the “benign attitude” investors are
taking toward the country “can be challenged,” Anthony Thomas,
a London-based senior analyst for Moody’s, said today in Warsaw.  Thomas said a “relatively large” budget deficit of about
7 percent of gross domestic product is “manageable” for
Poland, so long as the government takes steps to narrow the
fiscal gap after general elections next year. “What is key is
what is going to happen in 2012,” Thomas told participants at a
credit conference in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
