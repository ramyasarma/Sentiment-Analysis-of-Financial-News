European  retail sales  unexpectedly
declined in August as government austerity measures and signs of
cooling global growth deterred spending.  Retail sales in the euro region fell 0.4 percent in August
from the previous month, when they rose 0.1 percent, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
Economists had forecast an increase of 0.2 percent, according to
the median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
