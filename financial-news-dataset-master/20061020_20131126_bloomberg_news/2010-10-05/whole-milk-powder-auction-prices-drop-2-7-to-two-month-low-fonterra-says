Whole milk powder auction prices in
New Zealand, the world’s biggest milk exporter, fell to a two-
month low as a weaker dollar made U.S. exports more competitive.  Milk powder for December delivery fell 2.7 percent from two
weeks earlier to $3,549 a metric ton, according to a trade-
weighted price index calculated by Fonterra Cooperative Group
Ltd. after its latest GlobalDairyTrade  auction . Prices fell from
a 15-week high set at the Sept. 15 sale and were the lowest
since early August.  Fonterra accounts for about 40 percent of the global trade
in butter, milk powder and cheese, selling $12 billion of
product in 140 countries. New Zealand’s currency has climbed 3.5
percent against the dollar in the past month, touching 74.99
cents yesterday, the strongest level since November 2009.  “The very low U.S. dollar would support their dairy
exports, making them quite competitive,” said Con Williams,
rural economist at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Wellington. “There
might be a little bit of pressure from supply, perhaps over the
next six months or so.”  China’s demand for milk powder will remain strong, boosted
by increased short-term demand from Russia, which is “looking
to import a bit more milk this year” after its most severe
drought in 50 years harmed crops, Williams said.  Payout Increase  Last month, Auckland-based Fonterra raised its farmer
payout forecast, citing rising global prices. The company
expects to pay its 10,500 farmers between NZ$7 ($5.24) and
NZ$7.10 in the year to May 31, compared with its Aug. 20
forecast of NZ$6.90 to NZ$7.10.  Fonterra sells whole and skim milk powder and dried milk
fat at its fortnightly Internet-based auctions. It offers one-
month  contracts  with delivery starting two months after the
sale, and two three-month contracts with delivery starting three
and six months later.  Whole milk powder for delivery from January through March
fell 2.7 percent, Fonterra said. Powder for shipment from April
through June rose 0.6 percent. Across all contracts prices fell
2.1 percent. The next auction is scheduled for Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
