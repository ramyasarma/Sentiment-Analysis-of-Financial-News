Pandora A/S , the Danish maker of
charm bracelets, rose 25 percent in its first day of trading
after selling 9.96 billion kroner ($1.8 billion) of shares 
in the country’s biggest initial public offering in 16 years.   The  shares  closed at 263 kroner on the  Nasdaq  OMX stock
exchange, compared with a 210-kroner IPO price that valued 
Pandora at 27.3 billion kroner ($5 billion).  The IPO proceeds totaled almost 10 billion kroner and will
increase to 11.4 billion kroner if an over-allotment option is
exercised in full, the Glostrup, Denmark-based company said
today in a stock-exchange statement. It was the biggest Danish
IPO since the government sold a stake in phone company TDC A/S
in 1994, fetching $3 billion, and the second-largest in Western
Europe so far this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.   “The price is taking into account a very positive scenario
going forward, with high growth rates and high margins,” said
 Soeren Loentoft Hansen , an analyst at Sydbank A/S. “Much of
that potential is already priced in at current levels.” Hansen
has a “neutral” rating on the stock.  The IPO price was near the upper end of the 175-kroner to
225-kroner range announced when the offer period started Sept.
23.  JPMorgan, Goldman  Pandora sold 2,857,142 newly issued shares as well as
44,552,785 existing shares sold by Prometheus Invest ApS. The
over-allotment option includes 6,682,917 existing shares granted
to the joint global coordinators at the offer price.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Nordea
Bank AB arranged the IPO.  About 36 percent of Pandora will be publicly traded. The
free float will total 41 percent should the over-allotment
option be exercised in full by Nov. 4, the company said.  Pandora’s first-half  revenue  more than doubled, with its
main product generating 87 percent of sales, the company said in
August.  “We see a real risk that consumers at some point will turn
their backs on Pandora’s charm-bracelet concept, which would
threaten sales and profits,” Sydbank’s Hansen said.  Approximately 5,000 investors bought stock in Pandora, 5
percent of whom were Danish individual investors and the rest
Danish and international institutions, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
