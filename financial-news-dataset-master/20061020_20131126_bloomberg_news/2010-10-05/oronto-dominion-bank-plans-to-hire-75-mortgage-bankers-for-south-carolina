Toronto-Dominion Bank , Canada’s
second-largest lender, plans to hire 75 people in South Carolina
to expand its U.S. mortgage business after completing the
purchase of South Financial Group Inc. last week.  The Toronto-based bank expects to fill about 50 of the
positions in “the coming weeks,” the lender said today in a
statement.  Toronto-Dominion said its residential mortgage business in
the U.S. has doubled in the past two years and will continue to
increase into 2011. The bank completed its acquisition last week
of Greenville, South Carolina-based South Financial, adding
about 175 branches in the Carolinas and Florida.  Following the $191.6 million purchase, Toronto-Dominion has
about 1,300 locations in the U.S., more than it has in Canada.  Toronto-Dominion rose 12 cents to C$73.70 in trading
yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have climbed
12 percent this year, the  most  among Canada’s six largest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
