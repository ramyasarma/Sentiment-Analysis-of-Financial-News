Sun Mountain  Sports Inc., maker of
the U.S. Ryder Cup golf team’s rain suits, said it was very
sorry its outerwear leaked during the event.  In a  statement  posted on the Missoula, Montana-based
company’s  Facebook page , Sun Mountain owner Rick Reimers said
the company will apologize to U.S. captain  Corey Pavin 
and his wife, Lisa, at its “earliest opportunity and hope they
will accept our heartfelt apology for the stress this must have
caused.” Lisa Pavin selected the team’s clothing.  Reimers said the company is still evaluating what caused
its RainFlex outerwear to leak during the opening day of the
event at Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales. The competition
ended yesterday with the European team taking the cup from the
U.S. by one point.  “We believed, as Corey must have, that our RainFlex, built
with quiet, stretchable, breathable fabric would be an advantage
to the U.S. team,” Reimers said. “That it was not is a great
disappointment. It just was not enough for the torrential rains
at Celtic Manor.”  After players complained that their pants and jackets
weren’t performing well on Oct. 1, the PGA of America bought new
apparel for competitors and caddies in the merchandise tent at
Celtic Manor.  Europe defeated the U.S. 14 1/2-13 1/2 to win back the
trophy the Americans had won two years earlier in Louisville,
Kentucky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
