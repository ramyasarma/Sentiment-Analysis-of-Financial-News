Axis Bank Ltd. , India’s largest
underwriter of domestic rupee bonds, plans to sell as much as
$200 million of commercial paper, according to Standard & Poor’s.  The notes will be rated A-1, the second-highest short-term
investment grade, and are supported by a letter of credit from
Bank of America N.A., S&P said in a statement today.  Axis Bank, based in Mumbai, will use money from the notes
to fund its three overseas branches, said a person familiar with
the matter, who asked not to be identified as he isn’t
authorized to speak to the media. The paper will have maturities
of between one week and one year, the person said.  India’s National Housing Bank, which has the same AAA long-
term rating as Axis at Fitch National, raised 2.5 billion rupees
($56 million) on Oct. 1 from 7 percent notes maturing in Dec.
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Axis Bank treasurer  Parthasarathi Mukherjee  couldn’t
immediately be reached for a comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
