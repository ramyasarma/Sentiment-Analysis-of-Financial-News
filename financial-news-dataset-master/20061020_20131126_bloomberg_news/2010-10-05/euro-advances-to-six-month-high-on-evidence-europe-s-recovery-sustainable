The dollar fell to the lowest level
since January against a basket of currencies including the euro
and yen on speculation the Federal Reserve will debase the
greenback by increasing purchases of government debt.  Gold futures jumped to a record $1,342.60 an ounce as the
dollar sagged. The yen touched a level stronger than 83 against
the dollar for the first time since Japan intervened in foreign-
exchange markets in September to protect its export-dependent
economy. Japan’s currency fell earlier today after the central
bank said it would step up asset purchases.  “People are getting away from the dollar because the U.S.
will have to do more quantitative easing than they originally
thought,” said  Brian Taylor , chief currency trader at
Manufacturers & Traders Trust Co. in Buffalo, New York.
“Chatter about currencies is mostly political, but whether it’s
the G-7 or G-20, they are going to have to get together and
decide the best policy.”  The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, dropped 0.8 percent to 77.81 at 4:04 p.m. in
New York, from 78.45 yesterday. It touched 77.70, the lowest
level since Jan. 20.  Stocks rallied as investors speculated that global central
banks will join Japan’s efforts to stoke economic growth. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.1 percent. Treasury two-year
note yields were near the record low of 0.3987 percent.  The seven-day  relative strength  gauge of the Dollar Index
remained below 30 for an 11th day in the longest stretch since
March 2008. A reading at that level indicates the greenback may
be poised to increase.  Emerging Markets  Governments from South Korea to Brazil stepped up attempts
to control their currencies as investors poured a record amount
of money into emerging markets.  Regulators in Seoul will start an audit of lenders handling
foreign-currency derivatives on Oct. 19 to curb volatility
caused by capital flows, the finance ministry said today. Brazil
doubled a tax it charges foreigners on investments in fixed-
income securities to 4 percent yesterday.  South Korea’s won declined for the first time in seven
days, slipping 0.7 percent to 1,130.58 per dollar. It reached
1,122.30 yesterday, the strongest level since May 5. Brazil’s
real extended gains versus the dollar, advancing as much as 1.8
percent to 1.6680, the strongest level since September 2008.  In Thailand, the central bank was studying measures to help
manage the appreciation of the baht. The Reserve Bank of India
said action would be taken if capital flows proved disruptive.
Taiwan’s dollar erased yesterday’s gains on suspected
intervention by the central bank.  ‘Looking for Yield’  “People are still looking for yield, and they are going to
go where they can get the most, which is emerging markets, who
then are fighting appreciation and fighting the
macroeconomics,” said  Jessica Hoversen , an analyst at the
futures broker MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  Central banks that weaken their currencies through
intervention as a way of deterring speculators risk stifling
economic growth,  Alexei Ulyukayev , first deputy chairman of
Russia’s central bank, said today.  Bank Rossii has “made serious progress in liberalizing the
exchange rate,” selling $1.3 billion in September compared with
interventions earlier this year that exceeded $10 billion a
month, according to Ulyukayev.  Dollar Versus Euro  The dollar depreciated 1.1 percent to $1.3837 per euro,
from $1.3685 yesterday, after touching $1.3859, the weakest
level since Feb. 4. The yen gained 0.2 percent to 83.20 per
dollar, from 83.36. It touched 82.96, the strongest level since
Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged intervening after the currency
reached a 15-year high. The yen declined 0.9 percent to 115.12
per euro, from 114.08.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that the
central bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases that
ended in March improved the economy and that further buying is
likely to help more. New York Fed President  William Dudley  said
on Oct. 1 that the central bank has the “tools that can provide
additional stimulus at costs that do not appear to be
prohibitive.”  The yen fell earlier today versus the dollar as the Bank of
Japan said it will set up a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to
buy government bonds and other assets, inflating the balance
sheet at a time when U.S. and U.K. central bankers are
contemplating similar moves. The bank cut the overnight call
rate target to a range of zero to 0.1 percent, the lowest level
since 2006, from 0.1 percent.  ‘Unilateral Basis’  “Clearly the recent movements on a very unilateral basis
conducted by Japan for instance including this morning” need to
be addressed multilaterally by the G-20, said France’s Finance
Minister  Christine Lagarde  on France’s plan for the Group of 20
presidency. She spoke at an investment forum in Moscow.  The rand gained as much as 1.7 percent to 6.8825 per
dollar, the strongest level since January 2008, as Japan’s
pledge to keep interest rates at almost zero boosted South
Africa’s yield advantage.  The Aussie rose 0.3 percent to 97.13 U.S. cents, reversing
earlier losses that came after the Reserve Bank of Australia
held the overnight cash rate target at 4.50 percent, as forecast
by only 6 of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Australian currency remained lower against other major
counterparts, declining 0.6 percent to NZ$1.2972 versus the New
Zealand dollar.  Turkey’s lira appreciated as much as 2 percent to 1.4258
per dollar, the strongest level since October 2008. Moody’s
Investors Service upgraded its outlook on the nation’s Ba2 local
and foreign-currency government bond ratings to “positive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
