Zambia National Commercial Bank Plc,
the Lusaka-based lender in which Rabobank Nederland NV owns a
stake, expects its return on equity, a measure of profit, to
increase to about 25 percent from the “mid-teens,” Chief
Executive Officer Mark Wiessing said.  Zanaco, as it is known,  is forecasting revenue growth of
25 percent a year and expects loans to increase up to 30 percent
a year, he said in a presentation at a conference hosted by
Nedbank Capital and Royal Bank of Scotland in Johannesburg
today.  Zanaco plans to double the number of ATMs in Zambia to 200
by the end of next year and is also considering entering private
banking, Wiessing said.  Rabobank is the world’s largest
agricultural lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
