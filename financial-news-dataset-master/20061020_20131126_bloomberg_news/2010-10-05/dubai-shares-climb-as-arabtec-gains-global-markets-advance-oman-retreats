Dubai shares rose for a second time
this week as Arabtec jumped the most in four months and stocks
advanced globally. Other gulf markets declined.  Arabtec Holding Co. , the biggest builder in the United Arab
Emirates, advanced to the highest since May 30 after its Saudi
unit won a 5 billion-riyal ($1.33 billion) order.  Emaar
Properties PJSC , the builder of the world’s tallest tower and
the company with the heaviest weighting in the  Dubai Financial
Market General Index , gained the most in more than a week. The
Dubai benchmark increased 0.2 percent to 1,689.71 at the 2 p.m.
close in the emirate.  “Positive sentiment from abroad pulls buyers gradually
into the market,” said  Amro Halwani , a trader at Shuaa Capital
PSC in Riyadh. “Arabtec’s positive news also helped spur fund
inflows into the sector.”  Most European stocks rose, snapping six days of losses for
the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index , as Moody’s Investors Service said
it’s impressed with Greece’s efforts to reform its finances.
U.S. futures and Asian shares gained.  Arabtec jumped 5 percent to 2.11 dirhams. The company’s
Saudi unit won an order to build 5,000 villas for Saudi Binladin
Group in the Eastern Province. Emaar gained 1.1 percent to 3.76
dirhams.  Qatar’s  QE Index  fell 0.1 percent and Bahrain’s  measure 
dropped 0.3 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  gauge  and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index 
both lost 0.2 percent. The  Kuwait SE Price Index  and the  Tadawul
All Share Index  were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
