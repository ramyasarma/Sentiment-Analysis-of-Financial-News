Copper will trade at $11,000 a metric
ton in a year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said as it raised price
estimates because of swelling demand.  The forecast implies a 35 percent gain from the metal’s
current price. The bank had predicted on Sept. 17 that copper
would trade at $8,050 a ton in 12 months. Goldman today advised
investors to buy the December 2011 contract as increasing demand
leads to shortages of the metal.  Copper for three-month delivery traded on the London Metal
Exchange jumped 23 percent in the third quarter, the most in a
year, helped by falling stockpiles and a weaker dollar. LME
inventories shrank by 17 percent in the period, and the U.S.
Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the greenback’s strength,
slid 8.5 percent, the most since 2002.  “Supply-demand deficits look set to grow on emerging-
market strength and improving demand from developed economies,
which we expect to significantly outpace supply growth, drawing
down inventories and creating market shortages,” analysts
including London-based  Jeffrey Currie  said in the report. “We
don’t believe that the market is fully pricing these shortages
and the potential for demand rationing that lies ahead in
2011.”  Zinc Prices  Three-month  copper  traded at $8,156 a ton at 1:38 p.m. on
the LME. The December 2011 contract was at $8,025. Goldman Sachs
raised its three-month forecast for the metal to $8,500 and
increased its six-month estimate to $8,800.  Copper will average $9,300 a ton next year, the bank said,
compared with about $7,215 so far in 2010. Electrical equipment
and construction are the main sources of demand.  Goldman Sachs also raised its 12-month forecast for zinc to
$3,000 a ton. The metal, used to rust-proof steel, will likely
stay in surplus for now because of supply growth, though the
market will be more balanced in the year ahead and “possibly
swinging to times of deficit” next year, the bank said.  Zinc for three-month delivery was last at $2,288 a ton on
the LME, reducing this year’s decline to 11 percent. The metal
will average $2,575 in 2011, said Goldman Sachs, which on Sept.
17 predicted a 12-month price of $2,225.  To contact the reporter on this story:
