BASF SE , the world’s largest chemical
maker, plans to spin off its styrene division by the end of this
year, chemical news supplier ICIS reported, citing unidentified
people close to the company.  The spin-off will include styrene and polystyrene
operations outside of BASF’s Ludwigshafen site, as well as
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, styrene butadiene copolymer as
well as styrenic copolymers, said ICIS, citing a person familiar
with the plans who attended the annual meeting of the European
Petrochemical Association in Budapest. No clear partner has been
chosen, it said on its  website .  Prior to the move, BASF registered the name Styrolution in
June, ICIS reported. Styrene operations in Ludwigshafen will
remain within BASF’s so-called Verbund, an inter-connected
chemical park that maximises the use of by-products, the trade
publication said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Noel in London at
