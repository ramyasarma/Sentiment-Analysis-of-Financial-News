Australia recorded its fifth straight
 trade surplus  in August as exports of coal gained and imports of
aircraft and industrial machinery fell.  The surplus widened to A$2.35 billion ($2.3 billion) from a
revised A$1.74 billion in July, the Bureau of Statistics said in
a report in Sydney today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News  survey  of 24 economists was for a A$2.3 billion surplus.  Australia’s trade balance supports the central bank’s view
that the nation’s economy will accelerate as companies such as
Chevron Corp. expand projects to meet demand from China for
energy and raw materials. The Reserve Bank of Australia will
decide today whether higher interest rates are needed to avert
faster inflation amid signs that past increases are cooling the
nation’s property market.  “The uptrend in the surplus remains intact,”  Rob Henderson , chief markets economist at National Australia Bank
Ltd. in Sydney, said ahead of today’s report.  Exports  fell 2 percent to A$24.7 billion in August, today’s
report showed. Shipments of coal gained 10 percent and iron ore
exports fell 10 percent.  Imports declined 5 percent to A$22.4 billion. Aircraft
imports dropped 42 percent and industrial equipment slipped 6
percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
