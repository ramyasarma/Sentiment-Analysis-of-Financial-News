The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
surge 13 percent through the end of January following the best
September since 1939, according to Bank of America Corp.  Gains average 6.8 percent Sept. 30 to Jan. 31 following
September rallies, Bank of America’s  David Bianco  wrote in an
Oct. 1 note that cites data back to 1929. During “heightened
economic and political uncertainty,” the average return is 13
percent, the head of U.S. equity strategy said. The benchmark
stock index gained 8.8 percent last  month  to 1,141.20 after
falling in August amid speculation the economy would enter the
second recession in three years.  Investors regained confidence last month as reports showed
demand for capital goods improved and private employment and
manufacturing growth beat estimates. Strategists expect the
gauge to gain another 5.2 percent through the end of the year as
companies post a 23 percent gain in third-quarter earnings,
according to the averages in Bloomberg surveys.  “A strong September is usually a prelude to strong year-
end finish,” Bianco wrote in the note. “We expect a strong
third-quarter earnings season with third-quarter earnings-per-
share likely coming in between $21 and $21.75, higher than our
$20.50 estimate.”  Alcoa ’s Report  S&P 500 companies  beat  estimates by 14 percent and 11
percent in the first and second quarters, respectively. Alcoa
Inc., the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, helps start the third-
quarter reporting season Oct. 7, when it may  report  earnings of
6 cents a share, according to the average of analyst estimates.  The S&P 500 has failed to exceed its 2010 peak reached
April 23 amid concern that the European debt crisis will curb
global growth. It is still down 4.6 percent from that level.  The congressional election next month is weighing on the
market as investors seek clarity on the political leadership and
the uncertainties about tax policies, Bianco said. The equity
index will trade in a range of 1,200 and 1,300 for the rest of
the year and into early 2011, limited by Congress’ inability to
pass legislation on taxes for capital gains and dividends,
according to Bianco.  His year-end projection for the S&P 500 is 1,250, the
third-highest of 11 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. Bianco
estimates total earnings for the measure of $83 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
