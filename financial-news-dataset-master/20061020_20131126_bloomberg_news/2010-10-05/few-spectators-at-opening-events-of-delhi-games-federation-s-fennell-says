Only a few spectators watched
Commonwealth Games events yesterday, the chief of the games
federation, Mike Fennell, said at a press conference today.  The Delhi Organizing Committee has largely “rectified”
problems with ticketing for the competition, Suresh Kalmadi, the
body’s top official, said. About 600,000 tickets have so far
been sold, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
