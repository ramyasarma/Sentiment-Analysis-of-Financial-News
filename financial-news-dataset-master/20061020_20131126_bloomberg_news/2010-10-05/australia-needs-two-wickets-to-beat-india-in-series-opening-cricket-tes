Australia needs two wickets to win
the first cricket Test at Mohali after reducing India to 162-8
at lunch on the final day. The home team requires another 54
runs for the victory.  India, which resumed at 55-4 chasing a target of 216,
slumped to 124-8 before VVS Laxman and Ishant Sharma rallied
with an unbeaten 38-run partnership from 51 balls.  Laxman, the last specialist batsman remaining, was 48 not
out at the break with Sharma on 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
