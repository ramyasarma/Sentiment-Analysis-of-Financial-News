Justin Morneau  will miss the
Minnesota Twins’ playoff run for the second straight season.  The 2006 American League Most Valuable Player has been out
since July 7 because of a concussion and the Twins said
yesterday he won’t return this postseason.  An All-Star first baseman, Morneau had already been ruled
out of the best-of-five AL Division Series against the New York
Yankees, which opens tomorrow in Minneapolis.  Twins General Manager  Bill Smith  said trying to get Morneau
ready for the American League Championship Series or World
Series, if the team advances that far, would be “accelerating
the process too quickly.”  “We are going to shut him down for the postseason and just
take away that question mark,” Smith said, according to the
 Twins’ website .  Through 81 games, Morneau was hitting .345 with 18 home
runs and 56 runs batted in. He was injured when he was
accidentally kneed in the head by Blue Jays second baseman  John McDonald  during a game in Toronto.  Morneau missed the 2009 Major League Baseball postseason
because of a stress fracture in his lower back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
