Corn jumped the most in a week on
speculation that the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter, will cut its crop forecast again after floods and hot
weather damaged plants.  Production may fall to 12.977 billion bushels from a record
13.11 billion last year, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
On Sept. 10, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reduced its
estimate to 13.16 billion from 13.365 billion in August. The
agency will update its projection on Oct. 8. Corn prices are up
44 percent in the past year.  “People are convinced that the U.S. crop will be smaller,
and that will tighten inventories,” said  Greg Grow , the
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. “Corn demand has not slowed” after prices rose 33
percent in the third quarter, he said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 19.5 cents, or 4.1
percent, to close at $4.91 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest gain since Sept. 24. Yesterday, the
price touched $4.5425, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since Sept. 3.  The U.S. Grains Council said that China, the second-largest
corn grower and consumer, may harvest 158 million metric tons
this year, down from 166 million forecast by the USDA last
month. On Sept. 15, the China National Grain & Oils Information
Center projected 169 million.  China’s imports next year may be 2 million to 3 million
tons and jump to 15 million by 2015,  Thomas C. Dorr , the
council’s chief executive officer, said today on a conference
call. Imports of dried distiller grain, a corn-based ethanol
byproduct used as animal feed, may rise to 2.5 million to 3
million tons in 2010, he said.  “China has a corn-supply problem” because of rising
consumer demand for meat, said  Chip Flory , the editor of the
Professional Farmers of American newsletter. “This crop
estimate has people thinking China will have to import more
corn.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
