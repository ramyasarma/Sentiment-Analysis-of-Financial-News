(Corrects rupee movement in fourth paragraph.)  India’s rupee weakened for a second
day, extending its retreat from a five-month high, on
speculation the nation’s refiners stepped up dollar purchases to
pay for costlier crude-oil imports.  The currency declined the most in four weeks after the
price of crude touched a two-month high of $82.38 per barrel
yesterday. India’s petroleum imports averaged $8.3 billion a
month so far this year, up from $5.4 billion in the year-earlier
period, government data show.  “The rupee is pulling back from recent highs as importers
find the levels attractive to buy the dollar,” said Roy Paul,
deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  The Indian currency weakened 0.3 percent to 44.72 per
dollar as of 10:06 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose as high as 44.235 yesterday, the highest
level since April 15. The currency surged 4.3 percent in the
past month, the best performance among the 10 most-traded Asian
currencies.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.26 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.12
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
