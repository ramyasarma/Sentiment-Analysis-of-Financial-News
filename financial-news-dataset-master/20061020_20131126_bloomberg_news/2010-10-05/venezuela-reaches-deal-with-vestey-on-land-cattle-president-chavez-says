Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
his country reached a “friendly agreement” with the Vestey
Group Ltd. for the sale of its local landholdings and more than
130,000 cattle. He spoke in a telephone interview broadcast on
state television late last night.  The government will take complete control of operations
owned by “the English company” -- as it’s known in Venezuela -
- by Oct. 20, Agriculture and Land Minister Juan Carlos Loyo
said on state television.  “The English company is ready for a barbecue,” Chavez
said. He didn’t give any further details on the deal. Chavez
also said he signed a decree to expropriate Agroislena C.A., a
vendor of agricultural products, which he announced Oct. 3.  Chavez plans to nationalize 250,000 hectares (618,000 acres)
of farmland this month and seize “double” that in November,
and will keep doing so at “at a gallop” in 2011, he said Oct.
3 on state television during his weekly show, “Alo
Presidente.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
