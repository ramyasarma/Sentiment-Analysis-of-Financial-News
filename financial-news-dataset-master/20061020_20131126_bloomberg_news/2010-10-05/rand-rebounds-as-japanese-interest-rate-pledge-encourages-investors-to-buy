The rand strengthened the most in two
weeks as Japan’s pledge to keep interest rates near zero boosted
South Africa’s yield advantage, prompting investors to buy back
the currency following yesterday’s slide.  South Africa’s currency gained as much as 1.8 percent to
6.8934 per dollar, the steepest intraday climb since Sept. 22,
and traded up 1.7 percent at 6.9014 by 5 p.m. in Johannesburg.
The rand lost as much as 1.5 percent to 7.0326 yesterday, its
biggest intraday decline since July 1, before closing at 7.0173.  The Bank of Japan unexpectedly reduced borrowing costs for
the first time since 2008, cutting its overnight call rate
target to a range of 0 percent to 0.1 percent, the lowest level
since 2006. Japanese policy makers also pledged to keep the
benchmark rate at “virtually zero” until deflation has ended.  Japan’s rate reduction “enforces the appeal of investment-
grade sovereigns like South Africa,” said  Luis Costa , a London-
based emerging-market debt strategist at Citigroup Inc.
“Exporters are becoming a lot more tactical and will be
offloading dollars to get their rand after a bit of a sell-off
yesterday.”  South Africa is rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s, the
seventh-highest of the rating company’s 10 investment grades.  The rand has rallied 36 percent versus the dollar since the
start of last year as near-zero interest rates in the U.S.,
Europe and Japan encourage investors to borrow cheaply in the
currencies of those countries to invest in markets offering
higher returns, a strategy known as the carry trade.  Bonds  South Africa’s 6 percent central bank rate has encouraged
net foreign purchases of 70.62 billion rand ($10.08 billion) of
the nation’s bonds this year, according to the  JSE Ltd. , the
company that runs the country’s exchanges.  Government bonds rose for the first time in six trading
days, with South Africa’s benchmark 13.5 percent security due
September 2015 gaining 23 cents to 124.96 rand. The yield fell 5
basis points to 7.38 percent.  “The carry trade is still alive and well,” said  Ian Cruickshanks , head of research at Nedbank Treasury in
Johannesburg. “Bond market fundamentals still look good.”  Earlier today the bond lost as much as 13 cents to 124.59
rand, taking the yield to as high as 7.45 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
