with Kenyan airline worker representatives on Oct. 11 to discuss

carrier of trying to reduce a backdated pay increase, Bonne
Nicholas Barasa, general secretary of the Aviation and Allied
Workers Union, said by phone after the market closed yesterday.  Naiade Resorts Ltd.  (NRL MP), a Mauritian hotel operator,
surged the most since at least November 2005, gaining 5.4
rupees, or 20 percent, to 32.4 rupees after announcing a sale of
500 million rupees ($16 million) each of shares and convertible
bonds to reduce its debt.  Phoenix Beverages Ltd.  (PBL MP), Mauritius’s largest
brewer, surged to the highest since at least July 1995, rallying
24 rupees, or 15 percent, to 185 rupees. La Nouvelle Brasserie

secured a permit to start operations, l’Express reported
yesterday, citing Chief Executive Officer  Richard Wooding .  The company will start selling Skol beer in Madagascar by
January and Phoenix plans to get a 15 percent share of the
market within two years, according to l’Express.  Safaricom Ltd.  (SAFCOM KN), Kenya’s biggest mobile-network
operator, jumped to a two-week high, adding 5 cents, or 1.1
percent, to 4.6 shillings. The stock had fallen to a price where
it offered “a good bargain,”  George Bodo , a research and
investment analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said
in a phone interview today. “There is strong demand from
foreigners. The fair price of Safaricom is above 5 shillings.”  Wema Bank Plc  (WEMABANK NL), a Nigerian lender, fell the
most this month, dropping 4 kobo, or 4.6 percent to 84 kobo.
Nigeria’s central bank extended Wema’s deadline to raise more
capital for a second time, giving it until Oct. 30 to come up
with the funds, regulator spokesman Mohammed Abdullahi said in a
statement today from the capital, Abuja.  To contact the reporters on this story:
