Rio Tinto Plc ’s board is getting
ready to abort a planned $120 billion iron-ore joint venture
with  BHP Billiton Ltd.  in Western Australia,  The Age  reported,
citing people it didn’t identify.  Rio has faced pressure from shareholders over the deal, and
may have concluded that the agreement favored BHP, The Age said.  Rio and BHP, the world’s second and third-largest producers
of iron ore, planned to save at least $10 billion in costs by
combining their mines, railroads and ports in the remote Pilbara
region. The deal, opposed by steelmakers in Europe and Asia, has
been pending regulatory approval.  Tony Shaffer , Rio’s London-based spokesman, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment. Ruban Yogarajah, BHP’s
London-based spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
