Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
the government may become a minority shareholder or sell its
entire stake in some state assets, possibly including VTB Group,
Russia’s second-largest lender.  “Is it possible that the state will become a minority
shareholder in such assets or exit altogether? It’s possible,”
Putin said today at a Moscow investment forum organized by VTB.  “This would take time,” he said. “Necessary changes in
the economy and the social sphere would be needed. These are
important assets for us. But on the whole, it’s entirely
possible.”  Putin’s comments came after VTB Chief Executive Officer
 Andrei Kostin  spoke about the sale of a 10 percent government
stake in the lender. On Oct. 1, Kostin said VTB “definitely”
plans to conclude the stake sale by mid-2011.  “We’re talking to strategic investors and evaluating the
market,” Kostin said today. “The government will have the
final word.” The lender’s main goal is to “increase
capitalization,” he said.  Kostin proposed that representatives of investors who buy
into VTB should be included on its supervisory board.  To contact the reporters on this story:
