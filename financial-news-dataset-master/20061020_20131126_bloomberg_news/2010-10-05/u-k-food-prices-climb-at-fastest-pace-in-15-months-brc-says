U.K. food-price inflation accelerated
to its fastest pace in 15 months in September because of higher
crop and energy costs, the  British Retail Consortium  said.  Food prices rose an annual 4 percent, up from 3.8 percent
the previous month and the most since June 2009, the BRC said in
an e-mailed statement today in London, citing a survey by
Nielsen. Overall shop prices rose 1.9 percent from a year
earlier, the most in five months.  The BRC said “sharp rises” in wheat, corn and oil costs
since early August have forced bread, dairy and meat producers
to raise prices. Wheat has soared about 35 percent since June
29, while oil has climbed about 60 percent in the past 18
months. The biggest government budget squeeze since World War II
may limit price gains as consumers curb spending, the BRC said.  “Past increases in commodity prices are now putting
pressure on overall shop prices, but the worst of this may have
passed,” BRC Director General  Stephen Robertson  said in the
statement. “Weak demand, poor consumer confidence and strong
competition between retailers are likely to hold back shop-price
inflation for the rest of the year.”  The BRC’s measure of shop-price inflation was also boosted
by the first acceleration in non-food price gains in five months
as clothing and footwear manufacturers passed on higher cotton
costs. Annual non-food inflation quickened to 0.7 percent in
September from 0.5 percent in August, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
