Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa grower, scraped a fixed tax on cocoa exports and replaced
it with a levy that varies with prices, meeting conditions set
by the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund  for debt
relief.  For the season starting Oct. 1, the main export tax is set
at 14.6 percent of the total cost, insurance and freight price,
according to documents given to exporters by the Finance
Ministry and obtained by Bloomberg today. Last season, the tax
was fixed at 210 CFA francs ($0.44) per kilogram.  Total charges on the industry, including another five taxes
collected by the country’s semi-private cocoa agencies, won’t
bring levies on the industry to more than 22 percent of the
international price, the documents showed.  The overhaul of the tax system on cocoa is one of two
conditions remaining to secure $3 billion in debt relief from
the World Bank and IMF. Ivory Coast also needs to have a new
regulatory framework operating for at least six months prior to
any debt cancellation. That new framework is largely in place,
the IMF said last week.  The tax on exports will help fund a forward-selling system
that the state plans to introduce to recoup losses should world
prices fall, the documents said. They didn’t provide any
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
