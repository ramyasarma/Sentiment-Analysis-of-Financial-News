Malaysia and the European Union began
negotiations on two bilateral initiatives, including a free-
trade agreement, to boost economic ties and investment as the
global recovery slows.  Malaysian Prime Minister  Najib Razak  and European
Commission President  Jose Barroso  yesterday officiated at the
start of talks for the EU-Malaysia Free Trade Area and the EU-
Malaysia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in Brussels,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Delegation of the
European Union to Malaysia.  Malaysia’s  economy  grew near the fastest pace in a decade
in the second quarter and may expand more than 6 percent this
year, central bank Governor  Zeti Akhtar Aziz  said in August. The
EU is Malaysia’s fourth-largest trading partner, with bilateral
trade in goods reaching 23 billion euro ($32 billion) in 2009,
according to the statement.  The proposed FTA will provide a long-term legal framework,
removing tariffs on most goods and opening up trade in services,
while the PCA will expand the EU’s engagement with Malaysia in
areas including taxation and customs, intellectual property
rights, combating terrorism and transnational crime, good
governance, human rights, migration and trafficking in persons.  The negotiations may last between 18 and 24 months,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
