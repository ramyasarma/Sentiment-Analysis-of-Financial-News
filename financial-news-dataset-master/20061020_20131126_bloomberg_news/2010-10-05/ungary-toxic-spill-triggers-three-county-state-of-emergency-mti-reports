Hungary declared a state of emergency
in three counties after a Magyar Aluminium Zrt. sludge reservoir
burst, killing four people,  MTI  reported, citing a cabinet
statement.  The accident discharged 1 million cubic meters (35.3
million cubic feet) of toxic red sludge, flooding the town of
Devecser, 163 kilometers (101 miles) southwest of Budapest, and
two nearby villages, according to MTI.  Authorities treated 120 injured and are looking for six
missing persons, while 390 people were evacuated, according to
the website of the country’s emergency services.  The alkaline sludge causes skin burns and several people
suffered eye damage, MTI reported. Zoltan Illes, state secretary
for environmental protection, called the incident an
“ecological disaster” and said the sludge threatened three
rivers, including the Danube, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
