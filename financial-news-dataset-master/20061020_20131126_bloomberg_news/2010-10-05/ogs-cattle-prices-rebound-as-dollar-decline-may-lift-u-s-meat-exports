Hog and cattle futures climbed for
the first time in three sessions as a slumping dollar revived
prospects for U.S. meat exports amid signs the economy is
recovering.  The  greenback  fell to the lowest level since January
against a basket of six major currencies. A gauge of service
industries showed stronger-than-forecast expansion in the U.S.,
signaling a pickup in the economy that may spur consumption of
pork and beef.  “If our economy is gaining traction, it’ll certainly
support the idea of improving meat demand,” said  Dennis Smith ,
a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. “The dollar’s down to new lows. It should support our
export business with these meats.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.35 cent, or 0.5
percent, to settle at 72.25 cents a pound at 1:04 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The commodity has climbed 10
percent this year.  Cattle futures for December delivery gained 0.375 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at 97.675 cents a pound on the CME. The
commodity has gained 13 percent in 2010.  Feeder-cattle futures for November settlement slipped 1.175
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $1.095 a pound. Earlier, the price
reached $1.09475, the lowest level for a most-active contract
since Sept. 27. The commodity has jumped 14 percent this year.  The Institute for Supply Management’s  index  of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, climbed to 53.2 from 51.5 in August. The median
forecast of 76 economists surveyed by Bloomberg news projected
the ISM index would climb to 52.  The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities added as
much as 1.6 percent as the weaker dollar increased the
investment appeal of raw materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
