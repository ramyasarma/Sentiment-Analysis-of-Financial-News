Brazilian utilities rallied in Sao
Paulo trading, with the benchmark measure capping the biggest
two-day gain in almost five months, after this week’s elections
eased the outlook for political risk.  “The results from the state government elections were
overall positive for utilities,” Barclays Plc analysts led by
Felipe Mattar wrote in a note to clients today. Brazilians voted
Oct. 3 for governors, lawmakers and the president.  Barclays raised  Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais , known as
Cemig, and Cia. de Saneamento de Minas Gerais, or Copasa, to
“overweight” from “equal weight,” saying Minas Gerais
state’s re-elected Governor Antonio Anastasia will maintain a
“market-friendly” stance. Elections in Sao Paulo and Parana
states were “positive” for  Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo , or
Cesp,  Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo , Sabesp,
and  Cia. Paranaense de Energia , Copel, the analysts said.  The MSCI  Brazil /Utilities Index gained 2.9 percent at 4
p.m. New York time, for a two-day advance of 4.8 percent, the
biggest since May 11. Gains were led by state-controlled power
company Cesp, which jumped 4.1 percent to 27.69 reais, while
Copel, the largest electricity distributor in Brazil’s southern
region, advanced 3.6 percent to 40.15 reais.  Brazilians will vote again Oct. 31 to resolve runoff races,
including the presidency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
