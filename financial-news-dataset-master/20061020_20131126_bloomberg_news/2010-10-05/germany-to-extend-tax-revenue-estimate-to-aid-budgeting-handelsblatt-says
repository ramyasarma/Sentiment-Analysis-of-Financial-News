The German panel that forecasts
government tax revenue will extend its estimate to three years
from two, Handelsblatt reported.  The change is driven by state governments that draft two-
year budgets and want to plan spending and revenue more
securely, the  newspaper  said, without naming any states.  The German panel of government officials and economists
meets twice a year to estimate tax revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
