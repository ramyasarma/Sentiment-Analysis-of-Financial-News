Marc Faber  said U.S. Treasuries may
become “worthless” as central banks, led by the Federal
Reserve, “print money” in an effort to boost economies, the
 Handelsblatt  newspaper cited the investor as saying in an
interview.  “Over the next 10 years, we won’t see any restrictive
monetary policy anymore and no real interest rates above zero,”
the Hong Kong-based investor told the newspaper in comments
published today. Bond yields will “rise massively,” he said.  Faber, 64, publishes the Gloom, Boom & Doom report and is
credited with predicting the 1987 Black Monday stock market
crash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
