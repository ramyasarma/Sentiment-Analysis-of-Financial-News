Saban Capital Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Haim Saban told CNBC that the Grupo Televisa
SA buy of as much as 35 percent of Univision Communications Inc.
for $1.2 billion will be “very accretive” for Univision.  “When you put that program license agreement together with
the purchase price, it is accretive to Univision,” Saban said
in an interview on CNBC today. “It’s truly a win/win situation
for both companies.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
