Jordan’s state security court late
yesterday sentenced the leader of a militant group to life and
nine others to 15 years with hard labor for planning to kidnap
children of intelligences officers.  The men had wanted to force the government to release
Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman, who took part in the suicide
bombing of three hotels in Jordan in 2005, the state-run  Petra
news agency  reported.  Rishawi was caught shortly after the Amman suicide hotel
bombings in November 2005 that killed more than 50 people and
was sentenced to death in 2006. Her husband was one of the
suicide bombers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
