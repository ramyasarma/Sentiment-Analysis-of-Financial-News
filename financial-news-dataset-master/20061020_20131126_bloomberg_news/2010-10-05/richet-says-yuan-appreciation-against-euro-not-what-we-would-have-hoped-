European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet expressed disappointment with the extent of the
yuan’s appreciation since China eased the currency off a two-
year peg to the dollar in June.  “It is not exactly what we would have hoped ourselves,”
Trichet told reporters today in Brussels after meeting Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao. Trichet said a further strengthening of the
yuan would contribute to “sustainable global growth.”  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
Olli Rehn and Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, also attended the gathering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
