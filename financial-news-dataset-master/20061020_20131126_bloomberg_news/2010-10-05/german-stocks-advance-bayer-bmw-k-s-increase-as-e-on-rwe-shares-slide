German stocks fluctuated, erasing
their gains, as declines by E.ON AG and RWE AG outweighed gains
by Deutsche Boerse AG and Bayer AG.  The benchmark DAX Index was little changed, slipping less
than 0.1 percent to 6,133.76 at 12:37 p.m. in Frankfurt after
earlier climbing as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
