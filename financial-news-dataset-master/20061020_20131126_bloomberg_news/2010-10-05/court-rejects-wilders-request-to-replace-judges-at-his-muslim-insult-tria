The Amsterdam district court rejected
a request by Freedom Party Leader  Geert Wilders , who is on trial
for inciting hatred and insulting Muslims, to replace the judges
hearing his case because they may be prejudiced.  “There are no weighty indications that the judges have
given the impression of being prejudiced,” Judge  Frans Bauduin ,
who was brought in to rule on the impartiality question, said at
the court today. The trial, which was halted yesterday, will
continue with the current judges tomorrow at 9 a.m. local time.  Presiding Judge Jan Moors yesterday, on the first day of
the trial, told Wilders the court “reads newspapers and watches
television” and that Wilders has been blamed by others for
being “good in taking a stand and then avoiding a discussion.”
By choosing not to testify “it seems you’re doing that today as
well.”  Wilders, who has agreed to support the country’s new
minority government, challenged the impartiality of the three-
judge panel because of what Moors said, claiming “a fair trial
isn’t possible anymore.”  “The words used by the presiding judge in that last
sentence were chosen unfortunately,” Bauduin said. “They’ve
given the requestor a wrong impression.”  Wilders, 47, is being prosecuted after complaints following
a 2007 Dutch  newspaper  editorial he wrote that called the Koran
“fascist” and compared it to  Adolf Hitler ’s book Mein Kampf. A
year later, he released the movie “Fitna,” in which he calls
on Muslims to rip out “hate-preaching” verses from the book.  To contact the reporter on this story:
