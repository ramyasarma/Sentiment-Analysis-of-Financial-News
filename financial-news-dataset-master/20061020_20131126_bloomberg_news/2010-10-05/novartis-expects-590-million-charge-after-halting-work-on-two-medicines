Novartis AG  is stopping development
of two experimental medicines, a decision that will result in
charges of about $590 million in the third quarter.  Novartis is halting work on albinterferon alfa-2b for use
in chronic hepatitis C and Mycograb, an antifungal agent being
tested for use in invasive candidiasis, the company said today
in a statement.  Novartis and partner Human Genome Sciences Inc. decided to
stop development of albinterferon alfa-2b after discussions with
European and U.S. regulators and due to new data from a mid-
stage study, Novartis said. Related charges will be about $230
million, the company said. Novartis didn’t give details about
its decision to stop studying Mycograb, though it said it
expects charges of about $360 million.  These charges will be partially offset by a gain of about
$390 million because of the sale last month of the overactive
bladder treatment Enablex to Warner Chilcott Plc, Novartis said.
This will be recognized in the fourth quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
