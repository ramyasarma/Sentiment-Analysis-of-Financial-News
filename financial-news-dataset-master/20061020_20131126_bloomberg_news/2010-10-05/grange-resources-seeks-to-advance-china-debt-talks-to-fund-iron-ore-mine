Grange Resources Ltd., Australia’s
largest iron ore pellet producer, said it held a preliminary
meeting about securing debt from one Chinese bank and will seek
to advance talks in the next two to three months to help fund a
A$1.8 billion iron ore mine in Western Australia.  Grange Chief Executive Officer Russell Clark said he met
with the bank following talks with largest holder Jiangsu
Shagang Group Co., China’s biggest closely held steel producer.  “Our view is that we should use the strength of the
relationships that we have and if you’ve got China’s largest
steel mill in on the project there’s got to be some potential,”
Russell said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
