Greg Smith , chief executive officer
of  Chi-X Global Technology , left the firm in the third senior
management change for Chi-X Global Inc. in a month.  The vacant position created by Smith’s departure won’t be
filled,  Mark Dowd , a spokesman for parent company Instinet Inc.
in New York, said by phone. He declined to comment further.
Chi-X Global Technology, known as Chi-Tech, was formed in
November 2008 following Chi-X Global’s acquisition of Cicada
Corp., which Smith founded.  On Sept. 7, Chi-X Global named  Tal Cohen , head of its
Americas business, as its new chief executive officer, replacing
John Lowrey, who moved to run its MarketPrizm unit. A week
later, Instinet said that  Ron Gould , chief executive officer for
Chi-X Asia Pacific, will leave this month “to pursue other
interests.”  Chi-X Global is a division of New York-based Instinet, which
in turn is owned by  Nomura Holdings Inc.  Instinet is the founder
of and a shareholder in Chi-X Europe Ltd., which is now
independently run and has its own management and board
structure. Last year Chi-X Global proposed buying out minority
owners of Chi-X Europe for stock that values the business at
$177.3 million, people familiar with the situation said at the
time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
