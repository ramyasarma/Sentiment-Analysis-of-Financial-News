India’s stocks fell for the first
time in four days, led by lenders, amid concern recent gains may
have outpaced the prospects for earnings.  Housing Development Finance Corp. , the biggest mortgage
lender, dropped the most in more than three months. The stock is
trading at 32.4 times estimated earnings compared with 19.3
times for the benchmark index.  ABB India Ltd. , a power equipment
maker, lost 1.1 percent after it was cut to “sell” from
“hold” at Deutsche Bank AG, which cited an “expensive” stock
valuation.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s  Sensitive Index , or  Sensex ,
fell 68.02, or 0.3 percent, to 20,407.71. Its 14-day  relative
strength index  held for a 17th day above 70, a level seen by
some investors as a signal to sell.  “We’re in a multiyear rally, but it’s wise to take some
profits at this point,” said  Vikas Pershad , Chicago-based chief
executive officer at Veda Investments LLC. “No market goes up
more than 10 percent every month; investors will have many
chances in the future to participate. I’ve also been shedding
some India exposure of late.”  The Sensex has gained 27 percent from the May 25 low,
approaching the record closing high of 20,873.33 on Jan. 8, 2008.
The gauge is the best performer this year among the world’s 10
biggest stock markets. The measure climbed 12 percent last month,
the most since May 2009.  The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
declined 0.2 percent to 6,145.80. The  BSE 200 Index  was little
changed at 2,591.54.  Housing Development lost 2.5 percent to 741.35 rupees, its
steepest drop since June 25.  HDFC Bank Ltd.,  the third-biggest
lender, lost 1.9 percent to 2447.8 rupees, paring its climb this
year to 44 percent. The stock is the best performer on the 30-
member Sensex.  ABB India  ABB India declined 1.1 percent to 922.3 rupees. Deutsche
Bank analysts led by  Manish Saxena  cited intensifying
competition in India’s power transmission and distribution
industry as an additional reason for downgrading the shares.  Foreign fund inflows to India’s equities have increased 55
percent this year, making the benchmark index the most expensive
in Asia and among the BRIC markets that also include Brazil,
Russia and China.  Overseas  funds  bought a net  19.6 billion rupees  ($439.6
million) of Indian equities on Oct. 1, extending this year’s
record inflows to 910.8 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
