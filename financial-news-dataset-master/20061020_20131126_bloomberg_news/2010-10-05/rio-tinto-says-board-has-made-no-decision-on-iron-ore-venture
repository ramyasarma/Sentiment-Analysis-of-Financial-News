Rio Tinto Group , the world’s third-
largest mining company, said it hasn’t made any final decisions
on its proposed iron-ore joint venture in Western Australia with
 BHP Billiton Ltd.   Rio’s board met yesterday and discussed a range of issues
including the joint venture, the London-based company said today
in a statement. The Age  reported  earlier that Rio was preparing
to abort the partnership following pressure from shareholders.  Rio and BHP, the world’s second- and third-largest
producers of iron ore, agreed in June 2009 to combine mines,
railroads and ports in the remote Pilbara region in a 50-50
venture. Melbourne-based BHP pledged to make a $5.8 billion so-
called equalization payment to Rio as part of the accord. The
venture, initially due to be completed by mid-2010, has been
delayed as regulators study the plan.  “The board acknowledged recent communications from
regulators that indicate potential obstacles to achieving
clearance for the joint venture,” Rio said.  Talks are continuing with the European Commission and the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
