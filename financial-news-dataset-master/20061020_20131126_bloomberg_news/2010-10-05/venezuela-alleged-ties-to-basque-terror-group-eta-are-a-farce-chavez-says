Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
accusations that his government supports Basque separatists ETA
were a “farce,” after two members of the group said they had
received weapons training in the South American country.  “I don’t doubt it is part of this orchestra that keeps
sounding and will continue sounding against the Bolivarian
revolution,” Chavez said on state television late last night,
referring to his 11-year regime.  Venezuela “deplores” the actions of Spain’s press and
right wing lawmakers in trying to “muddy” relations between
the two countries by legitimizing charges made by
“antisocials,” Chavez said on television, reading from a
Foreign Ministry  statement .  The members of ETA, as Euskadi Ta Askatasuna is more
commonly known, told police they received training in
marksmanship, weapons cleaning and communication in code during
training in July and August 2008, newswire AFP reported, citing
court documents it obtained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
