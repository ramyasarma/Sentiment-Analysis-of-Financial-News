Virgin  Blue Holdings Ltd. cancelled
16 flights today as its primary check-in system returns, the
Sydney Morning Herald reported.  The cancellations follow the disruption of 400 flights and
almost 50,000 passengers 10 days ago when the airline’s major
check-in system crashed, the paper said. The primary check-in
system was restored last night and will affect services until 5
a.m. tomorrow, the paper said, citing a Virgin Blue statement.  All on-line and telephone reservations are unavailable
until then, meaning passengers will have to check in at the
terminal desks, the paper said. Sixteen flights between Sydney,
Canberra, the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Melbourne have been
scrapped today, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
