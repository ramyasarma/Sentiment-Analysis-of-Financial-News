The dearth of dealmaking among U.S.
banks that followed the 2008 financial crisis is about to end,
according to Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the number of bank-industry
mergers and acquisitions each year since 1990, as compiled by
SNL Financial LC and cited today in an RBC report. There have
been 120 this year, just above last year’s total of 119, the
lowest in more than two decades.  Bank mergers will rebound next year, partly because the
industry faces “a triple whammy” on revenue, Cassidy wrote in
the report. Fee income will drop because of changes in financial
regulation, lending will either hold steady or decline, and the
Federal Reserve’s push to reduce borrowing costs will cut into
net interest margins, a profitability gauge, he wrote.  “Many banks will choose to sell out rather than deal with
the complicated web of regulations” resulting from legislation
such as the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, he added. The costs
of complying with industry rules may be four to five times as
high as they were a decade ago, in his estimation.  At the same time, having a “regulatory road map” in place
will help clear the way for dealmaking, according to Cassidy. He
added that many lenders have capital available for acquisitions
and government-assisted takeovers of failed institutions have
become less attractive.  Analysts John G. Arfstrom, Jason Arnold, Joe Morford and
Jake Civiello contributed to the report.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
