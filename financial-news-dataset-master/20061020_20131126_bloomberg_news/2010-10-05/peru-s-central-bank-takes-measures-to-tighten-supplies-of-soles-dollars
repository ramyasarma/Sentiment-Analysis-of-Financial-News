Peru’s central bank will issue new
types of certificates of deposits beginning tomorrow as it seeks
to tighten the supply of soles and dollars in the financial
system.  The central bank has created certificates of deposits in
soles with variable interest rates tied to its  benchmark lending
rate , the bank said today in an e-mailed statement. The bank
will also issue certificates of deposit that can be redeemed in
U.S. dollars, it said.  “These new monetary instruments will allow liquidity in
the financial system to be regulated,” the bank said.  Central bank policymakers have raised reserve requirements
and bought $8.8 billion this year as higher interest rates will
draw more foreign capital into the country and increase
volatility in the sol. The currency has gained 2.1 percent since
the end of May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
