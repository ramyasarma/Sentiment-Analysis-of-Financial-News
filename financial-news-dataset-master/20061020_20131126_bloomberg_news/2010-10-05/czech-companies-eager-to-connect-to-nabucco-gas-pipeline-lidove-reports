Czech energy trading companies are
pushing for the construction of a pipeline that would connect
the southern Czech Republic with the Austrian end of the Nabucco
gas pipeline connecting western Europe with the Caspian sea,
 Lidove Noviny  reported, citing Harald Stindl, the director of
OMV AG’s gas division.  At least 12 Czech gas traders have shown interest in using
the 60-kilometer pipeline whose construction costs will exceed 2
billion koruna ($112 million), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
