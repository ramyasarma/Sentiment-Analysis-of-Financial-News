Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
the nation’s fifth-biggest bank, began marketing a sale of A$500
million of three-year covered bonds, according to a person
familiar with the transaction.  The lender may price the notes to yield about 96 basis
points more than similar maturity Australian government debt,
the person said, asking not to be identified before a public
announcement.  The bonds will be backed by assets of Canada’s national
housing agency, HSBC Holdings Plc, which is managing the sale
with Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and UBS AG, said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
