The benchmark price of tea in  Malawi ,
Africa’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya, fell 7.3
percent at auction amid poor demand, Van Rees BV, a tea trading
unit of Netherlands-based NIBC Principal Investments, said.  The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.29 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) at a sale in the commercial
capital, Blantyre, compared with $2.47 two weeks ago, the tea
trader said an e-mailed report today.  “There was poor demand, especially for top grade tea,”
which affected overall prices, said  Emmanuel Phiri , a manager at
Van Rees, by phone from Blantyre today.  Supplies at the sale fell 1.6 percent to 352,540 kilograms
while revenue declined 6.8 percent to $535,278, Van Rees said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi,
followed by South Africa and Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
