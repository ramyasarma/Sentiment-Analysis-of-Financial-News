Mahathir Mohamad , the 85-year-old
former Malaysian Prime Minister, was discharged from a hospital
in Melbourne this morning after treatment for a chest infection,
his spokesman said.  “The medical team is happy with Dr. Mahathir’s rate of
progress, but he will still be placed under observation for an
unspecified period,” spokesman Sufi Yusoff said in an e-mailed
statement.  Mahathir, who retired as Malaysia’s leader in 2003 after
two decades as premier, fell ill after traveling to Australia to
address a seminar on human development. Doctors will continue to
administer antibiotics, the statement said.  A medical doctor by training, Mahathir suffered heart
attacks in May 2007 and November 2006 and was hospitalized in
April 1999 with a lung infection. He underwent heart-bypass
surgery in 1989 and again in September 2007.  The former leader left in “good spirits” and is likely to
fly home to Malaysia later this week, the Bernama newswire
reported, citing an unidentified hospital spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
