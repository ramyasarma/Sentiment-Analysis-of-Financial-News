South Africa’s sugar-cane production
may drop to 2 million metric tons in the year to March because
of severe drought in the KwaZulu-Natal province, Moneyweb said,
citing the South African Sugar Association.  This will be 26 percent less than the record crop of 2.7
million tons in 2000/2003, the Johannesburg-based Internet news
site said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
