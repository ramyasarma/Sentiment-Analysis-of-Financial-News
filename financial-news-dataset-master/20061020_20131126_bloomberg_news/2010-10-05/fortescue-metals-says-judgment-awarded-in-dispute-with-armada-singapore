Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. ,
Australia’s third-largest iron ore exporter, rose to a two-year
high after settling all disputes in relation to suspended
shipping contracts, with damages lower than an original estimate.  Fortescue suspended some shipping contracts in late 2008
and early 2009 following a  slump  in iron ore demand as the
global financial crisis prompted turmoil in freight and iron ore
markets. Total damages will be $159 million, Fortescue said.  “The total damages incurred is approximately $159 million,
which is well within original guidance of $171 million given in
February 2009,” Fortescue said today in a statement.  Fortescue closed up 4 percent to A$5.45 in Sydney trading,
the highest in two years, compared with a 2.6 percent rise in
the S&P/ASX 200 Resources index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
