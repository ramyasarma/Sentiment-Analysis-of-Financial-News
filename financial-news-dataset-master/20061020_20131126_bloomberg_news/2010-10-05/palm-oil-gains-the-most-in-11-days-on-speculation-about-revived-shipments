Palm oil climbed the most in 11 days
on speculation that shipments revived in September, potentially
keeping stockpiles from rising above levels in August.  December-delivery futures jumped 1.5 percent to 2,705
ringgit ($873) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange,
the biggest advance in 11 days. The price dropped 2.5 percent
yesterday, the most since Jan. 26.  “Inventories might not rise” as crude palm oil exports
rebounded in September, said  Sunaina Dhanuka , an analyst with
Macquarie Capital Securities (Malaysia) Sdn. Shipments have
increased 2.4 percent so far this year compared with a 1.8
percent gain in production, she said.  Malaysian  stockpiles  advanced 23 percent to 1.72 million
tons in August from July, ending seven months of losses, the
nation’s palm oil board said Sept. 15.  Production  rose for a
fourth month in August to 1.61 million tons while exports fell
18 percent, the board said. Data for September is due next week.  Shipments in September climbed 30 percent from August to
1.5 million tons, Societe Generale de Surveillance said in an
initial estimate last week. Intertek put the gain at 21 percent.  November-delivery soybeans in Chicago rose for the first
time in three days, gaining as much as 0.6 percent to $10.60 a
bushel at 6:12 p.m. Singapore time.  December-delivery soybean oil, which lost 3.6 percent in
the past two days, gained as much as 0.6 percent to 43.70 cents
a pound in Asia. Soybean and palm oils are direct substitutes.  Palm oil prices are expected to be about 2,600 ringgit for
the rest of this year, the Business Times reported today, citing
Malaysian Palm Oil Council Chief Executive Officer  Yusof Basiron .  Maybank Investment Bank Bhd. raised its 2010-2011 forecast
for crude palm oil to 2,600 ringgit from 2,400 ringgit on
concern that vegetable oil output could switch from surplus to
deficit. Global cooking oils may have a shortage of 800,000 tons,
from a surplus of 200,000 tons, analyst  Tan Chi Wei  said.  CME Group Inc.’s December palm oil contract, pegged to the
Malaysian benchmark price, dropped 0.9 percent to $857.25 a ton.
