A  Toyota Motor Corp.  affiliate has
sold its share of a Myanmar venture, majority-owned by  Suzuki
Motor Corp. , that made Toyota a target of criticism for its ties
to the country’s military junta.  Toyota Tsusho Corp.  sold its stake in June in the venture,
which builds cars and motorcycles with Myanmar’s government,
because of the country’s poor human-rights record, Reuters
reported earlier today. The Nagoya, Japan-based trading company
is about 22 percent owned by Toyota Motor, the world’s biggest
carmaker.  Katsutoshi Yokoi, a Toyota Tsusho spokesman in Tokyo,
confirmed the stake sale, declining to specify the timing,
reason, or stake size, citing an agreement with parties involved.  The venture, known as Myanmar Suzuki Motor, produced 12,000
vehicles in 2006, the report said, citing a researcher at
investment fund Domini Social Investments LLC. Toyota Motor’s
ties were criticized by London-based Burma Campaign UK, a
human-rights group that included the carmaker and Suzuki
in its  “dirty list”  of companies doing business with
Myanmar’s regime.  Toyota Motor halted exports to Iran in June after the U.S.
and the United Nations imposed sanctions in response to the
Middle Eastern country’s nuclear program.  Suzuki raised its stake in the Myanmar venture to 70
percent from 60 percent as early as this June, said  Ei Mochizuki ,
a spokesman at the Hamamatsu, Japan-based carmaker. Suzuki has
no plan to exit the venture, which began production in 1999,
Mochizuki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
