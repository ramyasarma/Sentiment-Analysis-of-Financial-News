UniCredit SpA  Chief Executive Officer
 Federico Ghizzoni  confirmed the bank’s plan to cut about 4,000
jobs in Italy over five years during a meeting with union
leaders today, according to Massimo Masi, general secretary of
the UILCA labor union.  The job cuts will be part of a five-year business plan that
Ghizzoni will present to the board by the end of the year, Masi
said in a telephone interview. “The meeting was positive,”
Masi said. “Ghizzoni confirmed the bank’s strategy” started by
his predecessor,  Alessandro Profumo , Masi said, adding it
includes an agreement with the union on staff reductions.  UniCredit’s deal with unions called for 3,000 layoffs among
its Italian workforce through 2013 and an additional 1,100 job
cuts by 2015 as part of a reorganization plan involving its
country units. Ghizzoni, named last week to replace Profumo, is
studying a new business plan to submit to the board by year-end.
The bank has 162,000 employees worldwide.  The FABI labor union is asking for a formal commitment from
UniCredit guaranteeing there won’t be further layoffs beyond
what is in the plan for the next three years, Mauro Morelli,
general secretary of FABI, said in a statement today.  A UniCredit spokeswoman in Rome declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
