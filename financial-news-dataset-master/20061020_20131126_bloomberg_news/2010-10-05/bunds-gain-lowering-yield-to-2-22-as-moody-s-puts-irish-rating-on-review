German 10-year government bond yields
were near their lowest level in a month as Moody’s Investors
Service put Irish debt on review for a possible downgrade and
the Bank of Japan stepped up asset purchases.  Irish bonds  fell relative to German debt as Moody’s said a
one-step downgrade to Aa3 is most likely if a downgrade goes
ahead. The BOJ pledged to keep its benchmark interest rate at
“virtually zero” until the end of deflation is in sight and to
expand its balance sheet to shore up the economy. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  stoked speculation the central
bank is planning to increase quantitative easing. Austria sold
1.5 billion euros of bonds.  “The Moody’s review has added to the positive sentiment
for bunds, but Ireland is on review by the market 24/7,” said
 David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in
London. “The BOJ’s actions have spilled over into Treasuries
and bunds.”  The yield on the 10-year bund was little changed at 2.24
percent at 12:58 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security due
in September 2020 traded at 100.06. The yield touched 2.20
percent on Sept. 30, the lowest level since Sept. 1. Two-year
yields dropped 2 basis points to 0.81 percent.  Europe’s services and manufacturing growth slowed in
September less than initially estimated, with a  composite index 
of both industries falling to 54.1 from 56.2. London-based
Markit previously said it dropped to 53.8.  Retail sales  in the euro region unexpectedly dropped 0.4
percent in August from a month earlier, according to Luxembourg-
based Eurostat. Economists forecast a 0.2 percent gain.  German-Irish Spread  U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were 2 basis points lower at
2.45 percent. Equivalent-maturity gilt yields were little
changed at 2.94 percent.  Ireland’s 10-year yield rose 6 basis points relative to
benchmark German bunds, widening the difference to 408 basis
points. The spread reached a record 454 basis points on Sept.
29. The Portuguese-German spread was 2 points wider at 385 basis
points, while the Spanish-German spread was little changed at
180. The difference between Greece and Germany was 777.  Moody’s, which downgraded Ireland to Aa2 in July, said it
will complete the review within three months. Standard & Poor’s
cut Ireland’s credit rating one step to AA- on Aug. 24, while
Fitch has a AA- rating.  “Ireland is on a trajectory toward lower debt
affordability over the next three to five years,” said  Dietmar Hornung , Moody’s analyst for Ireland.  Austria sold 660 million euros ($909 million) of 4.15
percent bonds maturing in March 2037 at an average yield of 3.28
percent, and 880 million euros of 3.5 percent September 2021
securities at an average yield of 2.81 percent, the Austrian
Federal Financing Agency said today.  German bonds have returned 9.3 percent this year, compared
with 9.1 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 10.1 percent for U.K.
gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Irish debt
has lost 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
