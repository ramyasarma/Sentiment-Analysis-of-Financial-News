Corn rose in Chicago, rebounding from
yesterday’s one-month low, as a South Korean grain group said it
will buy supplies from the U.S. Soybeans and wheat gained.  South Korea’s Major Feedmill Group said by e-mail it
planned today to purchase 110,000 metric tons of corn for
delivery in February. Corn futures yesterday touched $4.5425 a
bushel, the lowest level since Sept. 3, after the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said stockpiles on Sept. 1 reached
1.708 billion bushels, the highest level since 2006.  South Korea’s purchase “is a supportive factor,” said
 Gary Mead , a senior commodity analyst at VM Group in London. “I
think around $5 a bushel at the moment is a fair price. The big
factor is the uncertainty over China and how much corn it’s
importing this year and into next.”  Corn futures for December delivery climbed 5.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $4.77 a bushel at 11:20 a.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The U.S. is the world’s biggest producer
and exporter of the grain.  Soybeans gained on speculation that seeding setbacks and
dry weather earlier this year in Brazil, the second-largest
exporter of the oilseed, will curb production and improve demand
for inventories from the U.S., the largest shipper.  Soil Moisture  “I tend to feel more positive about soybeans because of
delayed planting in Brazil,” Mead said. “It’s not clear
there’s been enough rainfall to bring soil-moisture levels up to
where they ought to be. If soybean planting is off to a late
start, that’s not going to be good.”  Soybean futures for November delivery added 6.25 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $10.6025 a bushel. The price dropped 6.1 percent
last week, the most in 13 months.  Wheat climbed after falling yesterday, marking the longest
slump in four months on rain in Russia and Ukraine. Japan today
said it plans to purchase 141,350 tons of milling wheat from the
U.S. and Canada on Oct. 7, the largest amount in three weeks.  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 2.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $6.50 a bushel. The price yesterday touched $6.435,
the lowest level for a most-active contract since July 30.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris gained 0.5 percent to 200.25 euros ($276) a ton after six
declines in a row.  To contact the reporter on this story:
