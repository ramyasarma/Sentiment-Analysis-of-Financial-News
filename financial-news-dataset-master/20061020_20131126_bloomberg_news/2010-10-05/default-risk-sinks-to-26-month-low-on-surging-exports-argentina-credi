The risk of Argentina defaulting is
falling to a 26-month low as surging commodity exports bolster
confidence in President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ’s ability
to repay debt, credit-default swaps trading shows.  The cost of insuring Argentine bonds against default for
five years sank to 737 basis points, or 7.37 percentage points,
Oct. 1, the lowest since August 2008, according to CMA
DataVision. The swaps may fall to about 650 by the end of the
year, said  Ivan Aftalion , a trader with Standard Bank Argentina
in Buenos Aires.  Argentina, which defaulted on a record $95 billion of debt
in 2001, is benefitting from a 92 percent rise in export tax
revenue in September after farmers harvested a record 55 million
metric tons of soybeans. South America’s second-biggest economy
will expand 9.5 percent this year, the most since 1992, after
growing 0.9 percent last year, according to the central bank.  “Argentina has good fundamentals, good macroeconomic
numbers,” Aftalion said in a telephone interview. “The
tailwinds are blowing strongly in Argentina’s favor.”  Argentine car dealers sold 63,727 vehicles in September, a
38.5 percent annual increase, the country’s Car Dealers
Association reported yesterday. Sales climbed 11 percent from
August and may reach 630,000 vehicles this year, 10,000 more
than previously forecast, the association said.  Tax Revenue  Tax revenue climbed 36 percent in September from a year
earlier to 35.6 billion pesos ($9 billion), about 1 billion
pesos more than the median estimate of three economists in a
Bloomberg survey, the government reported on Oct. 1.  Argentina’s default swaps fell 16 basis points to 739 at
5:09 p.m. New York time, according to CMA.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the government’s
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries shrank 31 basis points
to 638, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI+ index.  Still, Argentine debt is the highest-yielding among
emerging-market countries after Venezuela and Ecuador, according
to JPMorgan’s EMBI+ index.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 3.9577 per dollar. The yield
on benchmark 7 percent bonds due in 2015 dropped 28 basis points
to 9.51 percent, according to Bloomberg market average pricing.
Warrants linked to economic growth rose 0.14 cent to 12.23,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Highway Operator  Argentine highway operator Autopistas del Sol SA said
yesterday that creditors holding about $294 million in defaulted
debt, or 95.7 percent of the total outstanding, participated in
a restructuring it opened in January.  Empresa Distribuidora y Comercializadora Norte SA, or
Edenor, Argentina’s biggest power distributor, last week opened
an offer to exchange 10.5 percent bonds due in 2017 for 9.75
percent notes that mature in 2022 plus cash. The swap closes
Nov. 1.  Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  in May delayed a $1 billion
sale of global 2017 bonds as part of Argentina’s debt
restructuring, saying the country would wait for yields to fall
below 10 percent.  Fernandez said Sept. 24 that she isn’t interested in
selling bonds at an 8 percent yield while the government can
still use international reserves to pay debt. The government has
tapped $5 billion worth of the country’s $51 billion in  reserves 
this year and plans to use another $7.5 billion in 2011, Boudou
told lawmakers Sept. 16.  Argentina paid 30 cents on the dollar in its restructuring
in 2005, four years after the 2001 default. About 25 percent of
creditors rejected the offer. This year, holdout investors with
$12.1 billion of $18.3 billion in remaining defaulted debt
tendered their securities in a swap led by Fernandez.  Inflation  Argentina’s use of reserves is helping fuel inflation as
the central bank boosted the sale of short-term notes to 60.4
billion pesos in September from 34.1 billion pesos in June of
last year and the government spends money budgeted for debt on
public works.  Consumers expect prices to rise 25 percent over the next
year, more than double the official rate and the most in the
world after Venezuela, according to a Sept. 15 survey by Buenos
Aires-based Torcuato Di Tella University.  The use of reserves “in the short run does decrease the
probability of default,” said  Claudia Calich , who helps manage
$1.5 billion in emerging-market debt, including Argentine bonds,
at Invesco Advisers Inc. in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
