Copper dropped for a second day as
as Japan expanded stimulus measures, weakening the dollar, and
on concern that the European debt crisis will be prolonged. Tin
traded within 1.2 percent of an all-time high.  Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to $8,022 a metric ton and
traded at $8,030 at 3:19 p.m. in Singapore. The December
delivery contract on the Comex in New York lost as much as 0.5
percent to $3.646 a pound. The Shanghai Futures Exchange is
closed till Oct. 7 for the National Day holiday.  Copper fell as “a stronger U.S. dollar and concerns that
Europe’s major banks are undercapitalized resurfaced,”  Mark Pervan , senior commodity strategist at Australia and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., wrote in a note today.  The  dollar  strengthened for a second day against a six-
currency basket including the yen, before trading little changed.
The Bank of Japan cut the overnight call rate target, reducing
borrowing costs for the first time since 2008, and policy makers
plan to set up a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) fund to buy state
bonds and other assets. A panel appointed by the Swiss
government said yesterday that UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG
should almost double the capital required under Basel III rules.  The economies of Europe, Japan and the U.K. will have
trouble picking up, according to Pacific Investment Management
Co., which runs the world’s biggest mutual fund. The Federal
Reserve will probably increase Treasury purchases to revive a
U.S. economy that is almost stalled,  Paul McCulley , a portfolio
investor at Pimco, wrote on the company’s website.  Cancelled Trades  Aluminum in London fell 1 percent to $2,340 a ton at 3:16
p.m. in Singapore. The London Metal Exchange canceled 220 lots
of the three-month contract traded just after the open of its
Select electronic trading system at 8 a.m. Singapore time, the
bourse’s help desk said by phone. The metal tumbled as much as
3.3 percent from the previous settlement to $2,286 a ton during
that 21 second period after the open.  Zinc dropped 0.4 percent to $2,220.75 a ton, lead was 0.6
percent lower at $2,263.25 a ton, and nickel declined 1.2
percent to $23,848 a ton. Tin was unchanged at $25,200 a ton,
just $300 off the record $25,500, which was reached May 15, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
