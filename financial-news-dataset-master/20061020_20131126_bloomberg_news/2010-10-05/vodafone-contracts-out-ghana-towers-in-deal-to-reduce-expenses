Vodafone Group Plc , the world’s
largest mobile-phone company, agreed to contract out its
wireless towers in Ghana to cut costs, in its first African
network outsourcing deal.  Eaton Towers, founded by former Vodafone executive  Alan Harper , will take over operations and management of 750 towers
for Vodafone Ghana, according to an e-mailed statement today.
Eaton may receive more than $20 million per annum following the
agreement of the 10-year deal, which allows the towers to be
shared with other operators, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  Vodafone, which bought a 70 percent stake in Ghana Telecom
in August 2008 for $900 million, is seeking to reduce costs in
the country after it wrote down the value of its holding by 250
million pounds ($395 million) seven months after its
acquisition.  The agreement “ensures that Vodafone’s infrastructure
will continually improve, whilst maintaining the lowest
possible operating costs,” Harper said in the statement.  Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, declined to comment.  Vodafone Ghana, which has 2.74 million customers, lost
84,000 net subscribers in the quarter ended June 30. The tower
deal is the second in Ghana this year after Millicom
International Cellular SA sold its towers to Helios Towers
Africa Ltd. in January.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. may also sell the mobile-phone towers
of its African operations to its Bharti Infratel Ltd. unit, to
raise as much as 150 billion rupees ($3.37 billion), the
Economic Times newspaper reported last month, citing people it
didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
