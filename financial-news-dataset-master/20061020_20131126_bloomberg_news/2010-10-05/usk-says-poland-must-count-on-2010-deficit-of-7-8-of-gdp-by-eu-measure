Poland’s general government budget
deficit this year may range from 7 percent to 8 percent of gross
domestic product, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said today in
Warsaw.  While the government “doesn’t want” the deficit to be so
high as 8 percent of GDP, it “must count” on the possibility
of it being near that range.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
