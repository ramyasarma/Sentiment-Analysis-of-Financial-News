Chile’s economic activity increased
at the fastest pace through August in more than five years as
the country recovers from a February earthquake, the central
bank said.  The economy expanded 7.6 percent in the three months
through August, the most since January 2005, the central bank
said on its website today. The median forecast of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 7.8 percent annual growth. From a
month earlier, the economy shrank 0.2 percent in August, the
report said.  Industrial output rose 6.9 percent in August from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in more than four years, the National
Statistics Institute said Sept. 28. Production of machinery and
electronics led output in August as activity in the textile and
metal fabrication industries shrank, the institute said.  “Recent industrial production performance has been in line
with our view of an improvement in the industrial sector’s
contribution to overall growth as the negative impact of the
earthquake gradually dissipated,”  Florencia Vazquez , an
economist at BNP Paribas, said Sept. 28.  Chile’s peso rose 0.3 percent today to 484.95 per dollar at
9:10 a.m. New York time. The currency has gained 4.7 percent
against the dollar this year, the second-best performance among
major Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
Colombian peso.  Chile’s economy will grow 5 to 5.5 percent this year and as
much as 6.5 percent in 2011, the central bank said in its latest
monetary policy report.  The International Monetary Fund estimates Chile’s economy
will expand 5 percent this year and 6 percent in 2011, which
would be the fastest pace since 2004, the Washington-based
lender said in a Sept. 29 report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
