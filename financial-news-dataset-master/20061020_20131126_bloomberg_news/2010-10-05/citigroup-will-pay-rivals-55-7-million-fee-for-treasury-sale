Citigroup Inc. , the fourth-largest
U.S. bank by deposits, will pay rival firms $55.7 million for
underwriting the U.S. Treasury Department’s sale of $2.2 billion
in the bank’s securities.  Citigroup will pay most of the fees to  Bank of America
Corp. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co , Morgan Stanley,  UBS AG  and  Wells
Fargo & Co. , which will each sell about 15 percent of the
shares, according to a regulatory filing by the firm today.
Almost 50 other banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Bank Plc, are also involved in the
sale, the filing shows. Citigroup isn’t underwriting the deal.  The Treasury, headed by  Timothy Geithner , is selling trust
preferred securities, or TruPS, that it received as compensation
for guaranteeing Citigroup assets as part of a $45 billion
bailout in 2008. Last week, it reduced its stake in the New
York-based firm to about 12 percent from 18 percent, returning a
$1.02 billion profit to taxpayers.  Citigroup will pay underwriters different commission rates
depending on whether TruPS are sold to retail investors or
“certain institutions,” according to the filing. Based on the
lowest rate paid for the deal, Morgan Stanley will receive at
least $6.87 million for handling the largest portion of the
sale, the filing shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
