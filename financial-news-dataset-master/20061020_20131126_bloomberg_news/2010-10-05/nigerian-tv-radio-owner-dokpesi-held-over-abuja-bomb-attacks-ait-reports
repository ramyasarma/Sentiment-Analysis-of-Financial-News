Raymond Dokpesi, founder of Nigeria’s
Africa Independent TV and Ray Power Radio, is being held by
security officials in connection with the Oct. 1 bomb blasts in
the capital, Abuja, that killed 12 people, the television
station reported.  Dokpesi was invited by the state security service to answer
questions on the attacks, and hasn’t been released, the
broadcaster said, citing Kanti Bello, a spokesman for Ibrahim
Babangida a former military ruler. Dokpesi is the director of
Babangida’s campaign organization.  Babangida is one of the politicians in the ruling People’s
Democratic Party who have signified their intention to contest
President Goodluck Jonathan’s bid to be the party’s presidential
flagbearer at the polls expected to be held early next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
