CEZ AS , the Czech Republic’s largest
utility, canceled a public tender to build a 430-megawatt, gas-
fired power plant in Skawina, Poland, citing restrictions on the
Polish energy market.  The company cannot pick a technology supplier for the plant
until the Polish market becomes fully competitive, spokeswoman
 Eva Novakova  said today in an e-mailed statement.  “CEZ is aware of the need for new energy capacities in
Poland” and “won’t abandon the long-term plan to build a new
unit in Skawina,” the company said in the statement.  The Prague-based utility had been buying up plants,
distribution networks and mines in central and eastern Europe
until earlier this year. Last month the management announced
plans to slow down expansion and consolidate recent
acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
