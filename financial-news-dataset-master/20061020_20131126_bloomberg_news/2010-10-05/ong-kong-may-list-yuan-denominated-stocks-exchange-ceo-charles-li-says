Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. 
may introduce a separate class of shares valued in China’s yuan
next year, Chief Executive Officer  Charles Li  said.  “It’s the same security issued by the same company with
the same rights and terms and conditions and everything else,
but when it trades, this tranche is trading in renminbi,” said
Li in a Hong Kong press briefing today. “The only difference
between the two should be the currency difference. It really
shouldn’t have any valuation difference.”  Companies will be attracted to selling yuan-denominated
shares in Hong Kong because of the current regulatory hurdles
associated with bringing funds into China, Li said. He proposed
the creation of a “support pool” of yuan to boost liquidity
for companies selling shares denominated in China’s currency.  Li said investors who own Hong Kong dollars could access
the funds to buy shares valued in yuan and when they sell the
stock, they would receive Hong Kong dollars, maintaining the
size of the pool. Such an arrangement is “highly feasibly and
highly workable,” he said.  China is promoting greater use of the yuan overseas as it
seeks to reduce its reliance on the U.S dollar. The introduction
of yuan-denominated securities in Hong Kong may boost the
attractiveness of the currency to foreign investors, Li said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
