Sued-Chemie AG anticipates that One
Equity Partners will seek to exit its majority holding starting
next year,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer
Guenter von Au.  A public listing, coupled with a capital increase, is
possible in mid-2011, as is a sale to a strategic investor, the
newspaper reported.  There is no time pressure for an exit, Handelsblatt added,
citing an unidentified person close to One Equity Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
