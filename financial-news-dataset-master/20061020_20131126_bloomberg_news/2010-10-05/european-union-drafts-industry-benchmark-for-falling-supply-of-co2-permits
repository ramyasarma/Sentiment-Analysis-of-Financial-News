The European Commission has prepared
proposed benchmarks designed to assign a dwindling supply of
free emission permits to industries including oil refining and
metals manufacturing.  The commission, the EU regulator, has said its benchmarks
will start in 2013 and reward the most-efficient European
emitters. The draft from the climate division sets the stage for
the end of an era when participants in the European trading
system, the world’s largest carbon market, get most of their
allowances for free.  The benchmark for oil refiners was proposed at 0.0295 EU
emission allowances based on a so-called CO2 weighted ton
approach, according to a draft document obtained by Bloomberg
News. The benchmarking rules may be subject to further changes
before the commission approves them and presents the regulation
to the EU’s 27 member states.  “The commission hasn’t finished work on the regulation,”
EU climate spokeswoman Maria Kokkonen said today in Brussels.
“It’s in internal consultation.”  The commission’s refusal to delay phasing out free emission
allowances until the end of the decade will drive up costs for
refiners already struggling with a slide in crude-processing
profits, the European Petroleum Industry Association said last
month. The group known as Europia said it expects refiners to
get 25 percent fewer free permits than emissions.  EU Permits Rise  EU allowances for December 2010 delivery closed 2 percent
higher, the biggest gain since Sept. 24, at 15.57 euros a metric
ton on London’s European Climate Exchange. Permits are up 24
percent this year as utilities increased purchases amid signs
that the worst recession since World War II is ending.  The EU is seeking to balance the goal of reducing
allowances in its carbon-trading market with limiting cost
increases for energy-intensive industries. Refiners and other
companies that face higher costs have tried to persuade the EU
to put off plans until later this decade to scale back free
allowances for less-efficient plants.  The 27 EU nations approved plans in 2008 to auction rather
than give away most EU allowances in phase three, which runs
from 2013 to 2020. The bloc will auction around 60 percent of
the total number of permits in 2013, according to the  commission 
estimates, and the proportion will increase in coming years.  The draft regulation aims to determine allocation of about
6 billion free allowances in the eight years through 2020. The
benchmarks, based on the average performance of the top 10
percentile of installations in 2007-2008, will help determine
how many permits emitters get for free in phase three.  Historical Emissions  “The carbon-intensity benchmarks will be multiplied by
historical production figures to determine the implied free
allocation for industrial sectors,” said  Konrad Hanschmidt , a
London-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “However,
if this exceeds the historical emissions share of these sectors
in the phase-three cap, a reduction factor will be applied.”  The baseline period for calculating median historical
production levels will be either 2005 to 2010 or 2009 to 2010,
whichever is higher, according to the draft regulation.  The best installations in a given industry won’t need to
purchase more allowances, while those that emit more than the
benchmarks will need to buy permits on the market, Hans Bergman,
a specialist at the commission climate unit, said last month.  The EU agreed last year to give a larger share of free
permits to 164 manufacturing industries, including most steel-
related assembly. The “carbon leakage” protections included in
phase three of the cap-and-trade program, which runs from 2013
to 2020, are designed to prevent EU companies from fleeing to
less-regulated regions.  Manufacturers that aren’t on the list will receive 80
percent of benchmarked allowances for free in 2013 and face an
annual decline in that share to 30 percent in 2020, while most
utilities will face 100 percent auctioning as of 2013.  Following are some of the benchmarks proposed in the draft
regulation:  *T*
