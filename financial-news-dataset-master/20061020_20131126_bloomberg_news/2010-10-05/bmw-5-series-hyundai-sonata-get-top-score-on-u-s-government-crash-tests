Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s 5
Series and  Hyundai Motor Co. ’s Sonata received the highest
rating among passenger cars and trucks tested for crashes under
a new U.S. rating system.  Female crash-test dummies were added to the male figures
for the first time as the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration rated 34 models under a redesigned testing
regime, the regulatory agency said today in a statement.  BMW’s four-door, rear-wheel-drive  5 Series  and the latest
model of Hyundai’s  Sonata  were the only vehicles in the first
batch rated to receive five stars, the top overall safety score.
Both cars scored five stars on side-crashes and rollovers and
four stars in frontal crashes.  “We are raising the bar on safety,” Transportation
Secretary  Ray LaHood  said at a press conference in Washington
amid crash-tested cars. “We are subjecting cars to more safety
tests, addressing grade inflation.”  Nissan Motor Co. ’s Versa received the lowest overall rating
of two stars, scoring four stars in rollovers, three in frontal
crashes and two in side crashes.  Smarter Dummies  The new crash tests include dummies representing women, who
tend to be smaller than the male figures used exclusively in the
past and may be harmed differently in an accident, according to
NHTSA. The new dummies also collect data about injuries to the
chest, head, neck and legs, while the old ones measured only
chest damage.  NHTSA  has also begun compiling an overall rating for each
model for the first time rather than reporting only the front,
side and rollover collision results.  Automakers had questioned the redesigned safety ratings
because they aren’t directly comparable to the ratings they
replaced, potentially creating confusion.  “The new ‘Stars on Cars’ rating system will now reflect
our advancements even better,” Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers Chief Executive Officer Dave McCurdy said in a
statement. “But, since the tests are getting more challenging,
many ratings may go down at first -- even when a model hasn’t
changed.””  NHTSA plans to test 55 model year 2011 vehicles and will
test more models under the new procedures next year, the
agency’s Administrator  David Strickland  said at the press
conference. The overall rating won’t be displayed on window
stickers at dealer lots for 2011 models to give automakers time
to redesign the labels, he said, adding that the agency decided
to release ratings for models as they become available.  “It’s better for us to get this information out to the
public right now so they can make better choices about cars,”
he said.  The agency said it is continuing to test cars and trucks
and plans to add the results as they are complete to its website
