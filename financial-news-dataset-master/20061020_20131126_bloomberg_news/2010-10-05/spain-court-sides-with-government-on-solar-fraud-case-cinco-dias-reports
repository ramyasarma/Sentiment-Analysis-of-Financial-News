A Spanish court ruled in a solar-
energy fraud case that plants must have been producing power
before Sept. 29, 2008, to receive the highest price available
for electricity, Cinco Dias reported.  The Superior Court of Andalucia said that operators of solar
panels must have begun selling power to the delivery network by
that deadline in 2008 deadline to qualify for the tariff, which
was lowered in that month for subsequent projects, according to
the newspaper.  The ruling sides with the national government in a dispute
over suspected fraud, Cinco Dias said. It’s important because
tomorrow is the deadline for operators in an "amnesty" program
to voluntarily accept the lower rate if they can’t prove they
fully qualified for the highest rate, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
