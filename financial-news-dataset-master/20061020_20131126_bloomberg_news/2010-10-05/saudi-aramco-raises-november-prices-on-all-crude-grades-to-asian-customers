Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest
state-owned oil company, increased November official selling
prices for all crude grades for customers in Asia and on light
and medium blends to the U.S.  The company raised the formula price for  Arab Super Light 
crude to Asia the most, increasing it by 90 cents a barrel to
$1.90 a barrel above the benchmark Dubai price assessment
published by Platts, Aramco said in an e-mailed statement today.  Saudi Arabia’s state-owned producer set the price for its
Extra Light crude for November loadings for U.S. buyers at a
premium of $1.40 a barrel over the  Argus Sour Crude Index , 20
cents a barrel more than October cargoes, according to the
statement. The discount for shipments of Light crude to the U.S.
narrowed 15 cents a barrel, to 20 cents below the Argus index.  Aramco cut prices on all crude grades to northwest Europe
and the Mediterranean Sea for November delivery, the statement
said. The only grade for delivery to the U.S. in November whose
price was reduced was Arab Heavy, which was cut 5 cents a barrel
to a discount of $3.35 below the ASCI.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 8.7 percent on the New
York Mercantile Exchange during September to close the month at
$79.97 a barrel. Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said on March
30 that oil prices in a range of $70 to $80 are “as close to
perfect as possible,” and he hopes they remain in that range.  Aramco was likely to raise prices for Arab Light, the
world’s largest crude blend, as the premium for gasoil to the
regional benchmark Dubai oil gained,  Lawrence Eagles , head of
commodity strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, wrote in
the bank’s daily note yesterday.  OPEC Leader  The largest Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
member and the group’s de-facto leader, Saudi Arabia has led
production cuts announced in 2008 to support prices. OPEC
decided at a March meeting in Vienna to leave quotas unchanged.
The group will meet next week to review output and demand
forecasts. Most members are exceeding their quotas to take
advantage of prices that rallied 78 percent last year.  Oil ministers from OPEC member states Kuwait, Venezuela and
Ecuador have said in the past month they expect the group to
leave production levels unchanged at the meeting.  Saudi Arabia pumped 8.25 million barrels of oil a day in
September, 40,000 less than in August and 200,000 barrels a day
above its OPEC quota, according to Bloomberg estimates.  Aramco raised prices across the board on all grades to all
buyers for October delivery, it said last month. The company has
supplied full volumes to refiners in Asia since December. It
lowered prices on most crude grades to Asia for February, March,
April, July and September and cut prices for light grades to the
U.S. for September. U.S. and Asian consumers paid more for light
grades in May and June than they did in previous months.  U.S. Imports  Saudi Arabia was the fourth-biggest exporter of crude to
the U.S. last year, dropping from second place in 2008, data
from the U.S.  Energy Information Administration  show. Canada,
Mexico and Venezuela all shipped more crude to the U.S.,
according to the data.  For U.S. shipments, November marks the 11th month Aramco is
pricing crude against the ASCI marker, an index of high-sulfur
oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico. The benchmark replaced a
West Texas Intermediate crude price published by Platts, the
energy-information division of McGraw Hill Cos. WTI oil, a
lighter, more expensive crude grade, also trades as a futures
contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Oil exports to Asia increased as China bought on average
more than 1 million barrels of Saudi crude a day last year,
Aramco said in its June annual review.  The following table gives the differentials of the four
