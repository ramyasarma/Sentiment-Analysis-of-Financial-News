Dana Gas PJSC, Crescent Petroleum
Co., Mol Nyrt and OMV AG will produce 300 million cubic feet a
day of gas from its project in Iraq’s Kurdistan region in 2012,
a year later than expected.  The production rate is currently 200 million cubic feet a
day, Dana Gas said in a statement today.  The production rate was expected to reach its target in the
first quarter of 2011, Chief Financial Officer James Dewar said
in August, almost two years later than the company had
originally expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
