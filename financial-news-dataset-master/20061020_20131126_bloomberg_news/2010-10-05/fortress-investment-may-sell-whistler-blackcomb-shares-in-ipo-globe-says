Fortress Investment Group LLC may
sell shares in an initial public offering of Whistler Blackcomb,
a ski venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Globe and Mail
reported, citing unidentified people.  The New York-based investment firm has hired bankers to
explore options for the Canadian resort north of Vancouver, the
 newspaper  said. A filing with regulators ahead of a share sale
is expected soon, the Globe said.  Fortress may also sell the resort, although potential
buyers including businessman  Murray Edwards  and the Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan have already passed on the opportunity,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
