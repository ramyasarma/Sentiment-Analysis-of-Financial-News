London Stock Exchange Group Plc  said
that unspecified technical problems have delayed the start of
trading on its Turquoise platform a day after it moved to a new
trading system.  Trading is due to start at 9:15 a.m. London time, LSE said
in a statement on its  website  at 8:27 a.m. today. The market
usually opens at 8 a.m.  Turquoise, an alternative trading system owned by LSE and
its biggest customers, yesterday said it was “pleased” with
its first day using trading technology purchased from Colombo,
Sri Lanka-based MillenniumIT last year. LSE plans to move stocks
from its main market onto the new system on Nov. 1. The
Millennium platform is replacing LSE’s current TradElect system.  To contact the reporters on this story:
