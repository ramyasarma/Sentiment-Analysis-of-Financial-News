China, the world’s second-largest
corn grower, may boost production by 1.9 percent this year, the
U.S. Grains Council said, citing field inspections last week.  China’s corn crop may rise to 158 million metric tons from
155 million a year earlier, Thomas C. Dorr, the president and
chief executive officer of Grains Council, said today in a
conference call with reporters. The council’s estimate was based
on 300 field inspections during the past month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
