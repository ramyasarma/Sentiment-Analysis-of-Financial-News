German bund futures may climb as high
as 133.30 should they surpass a key resistance level,  ING Groep
NV  said, citing technical indicators.  The December bund contract faces resistance at the 131.70
to 132.14 levels, according to  Roelof-Jan Van den Akker , an
Amsterdam-based senior technical analyst at ING.  “The short-term picture is improving and prices are slowly
breaking the horizontal resistance area at 131.70 to 132.14,”
Van den Akker wrote in an e-mailed report today. “After a
possible close above 132.14, prices should test the next strong
horizontal resistance level around 133.30.”  The December contract was little changed at 131.72 as of
11:50 a.m. in London. It earlier reached 132.17, the highest in
four trading days.  Van der Akker added the contract is likely to have a broad
trading range between 129.00 and 133.30.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. A resistance level is an area on a chart
where analysts anticipate orders to sell a security and a
support level is an area there they anticipate buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
