Russia revoked the license of ZAO
International Industrial Bank, the lender controlled by lawmaker
 Sergei Pugachyov , three months after it defaulted on foreign
currency bonds.  “IIB didn’t fulfill its obligations to its creditors as it
lost liquidity,” Bank Rossii said today in an e-mailed
statement. “The credit institution followed a high-risk credit
policy and didn’t create adequate provisions for possible loan
losses.”  Dmitry Morochenko, an IIB spokesman, declined to comment
when called by Bloomberg News.  The bank failed to pay on 200 million euros ($274 million)
of bonds on July 6, or agree with creditors on restructuring
them. The central bank granted IIB an unsecured loan of about 32
billion rubles ($1.05 billion) for six months on July 5,
Interfax reported that month.  Bank Rossii plans to recover the 32 billion rubles within
the next several months, First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev 
said today at a conference in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
