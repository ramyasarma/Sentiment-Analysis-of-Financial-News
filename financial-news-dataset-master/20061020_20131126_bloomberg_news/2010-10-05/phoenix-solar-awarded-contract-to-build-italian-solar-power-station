Phoenix Solar AG  won a contract to
design and build a solar power plant in Italy as premium prices
guaranteed for clean energy speed development of one of the
German company’s fastest-growing markets.  Etrion Corp. contracted Phoenix Solar to build a plant in
Rio Martino using Trina Solar Ltd. photovoltaic panels and
inverters made by SMA Solar Technology AG, Etrion said in a
statement to Marketwire today. The station will have a capacity
of 1.7 megawatts of electricity.  Phoenix has benefited this year as investors rush to
markets like Italy where government-mandated prices for power
generated from solar panels boosts construction of arrays on
buildings and in fields. The German company is building another
plant in Italy for Etrion in Borgo Piave and also won a contract
from KGAL GmbH in May to build to power stations.  The company’s shares were unchanged at 26.40 euros as of
9:41 a.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has declined about 38 percent
this year, valuing the company at about 195 million euros ($268
million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
