Oil rose to a five-month high before
a government report today that may show U.S. fuel supplies are
dropping faster than forecast, while a weaker dollar reduced the
appeal of commodities.  Futures climbed as equities opened higher in Europe. An
Energy Department report today may show U.S. gasoline  stockpiles
slipped  250,000 barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute said
yesterday inventories of the motor fuel dropped 4.06 million
barrels, the biggest weekly decline since May 2009.  “There is some optimism in the market that inventories are
decreasing and the oversupply is shrinking,” said Sintje Diek,
an HSH Nordbank analyst in Hamburg. “This is an overreaction by
the oil market. The higher prices are not sustainable.”  Crude for November delivery climbed as much as 51 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $83.33 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That is the highest price since May 4.
The contract traded at $83.13 at 9:02 a.m. Brent crude for
November settlement traded at $85.03 a barrel, up 19 cents, on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  New York futures rose 1.7 percent yesterday after the
Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing
businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the U.S. economy,
climbed to 53.2 from 51.5 in August. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected the index would advance to 52.  Inventory Reports  U.S.  crude stockpiles  climbed by 4.44 million barrels last
week, the biggest gain in five weeks, the American Petroleum
Institute said. Today’s Energy Department report may show
 inventories rose  by 413,000 barrels, based on the survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  The dollar was at $1.3857 to the 16-nation euro after
declining 1.1 percent to $1.3839 yesterday. A weaker U.S.
currency bolsters the appeal of commodities as an alternative
investment.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.6 percent to 129.84
while the Stoxx Europe 600 increased 0.6 percent to 262.62.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures increased 0.2 percent.  Crude prices may rise to between $85 and $95 a barrel by
the end of this year as stockpiles decline in the U.S., the
world’s biggest oil-consuming nation, according to Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.  U.S. petroleum supplies may fall because of demand for
products from emerging markets including China, Goldman said in
a report yesterday. An economic recovery will probably cause
inventories to decline to “more normal” levels by early 2011,
it said.  “While U.S. implied oil demand remains firm, we believe
that the decline in U.S. net oil imports is the main driver of
the draw on U.S. total petroleum inventories,” wrote Goldman
analysts, led by New York-based  David Greely . “Strong growth in
emerging-market demand is beginning to tighten the U.S. supply-
demand balance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
