Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, fell the most in a week after  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA  cut its rating, citing an “expensive”
valuation following a $70 billion share sale.  Petrobras dropped 1.5 percent, the most since Sept. 24, to
26.98 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 4 p.m. New
York time. Itau cut the stock to “market perform” from
“outperform.”  Petrobras is trading at 11.1 times estimated 2011 earnings,
a premium of as much as 34 percent to international peers, Itau
analysts led by  Paula Kovarsky  wrote in a note to clients today.
While Petrobras slumped 28 percent this year through Sept. 24 on
concern the stock offering would cut earnings per share, the so-
called dilution will continue hurting prospects for share-price
gains, the analysts wrote. The benchmark  Bovespa  index fell 0.6
percent in the same period.  The sale “caused Petrobras to look more expensive against
its peers,” the Itau analysts wrote. “We believe that the last
two years have undermined Petrobras’ goodwill with the market
and consequently investors’ appetite to pay material premiums,
at least for now.”  The company, based in Rio de Janeiro, last month held the
world’s biggest share sale to help finance a $224 billion, five-
year investment plan. The offering includes $42.5 billion in new
stock paid to the government for the right to develop offshore
oil reserves. The price of $8.51 per barrel was about $2 higher
than estimated, according to Itau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
