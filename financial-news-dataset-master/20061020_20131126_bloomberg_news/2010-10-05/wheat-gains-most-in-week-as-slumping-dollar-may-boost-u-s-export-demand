Wheat futures rose for the first time
in seven sessions as a slumping dollar boosted the appeal of
grain from the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  The  dollar  dropped to the lowest level since January
against a basket of six currencies. U.S. exporters sold 52
percent more wheat in the four weeks ended Sept. 23 than the
same period a year earlier, government data show. Processors may
have stepped up purchases after prices fell to the lowest level
since July, said  Tom Leffler  at Leffler Commodities LLC.  “When the dollar goes down, it makes our exports more
attractive to foreign customers,” Leffler said from Augusta,
Kansas. “We did see a certain amount of end-user buying come
in, considering we pushed the market down pretty considerably.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 16.25 cents, or
2.5 percent, to settle at $6.635 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the first gain since Sept. 24. During
the previous six sessions, the grain dropped 10 percent in part
as drought-damaged crops in Russia and Eastern Europe received
rain. Futures are up 38 percent since the end of June.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
