Tennis Channel was granted a hearing
into its complaint that  Comcast Corp.  unfairly carries the
network on a sports tier rather than as part of a more broadly
viewed programming package.  A Federal Communications Commission administrative law
judge is to hear the complaint against the largest U.S. cable
company at a date to be determined later, the agency said today
in a news release.  Comcast refused to relocate  Tennis Channel  last year from
the extra-fee sports tier viewed by about 10 percent of the
cable operator’s customers, according to the complaint Tennis
Channel filed to the FCC on Jan. 5. Versus and Golf, which are
Comcast-owned competitors to Tennis Channel, are available to
subscribers for no added cost, according to the document.  “We look forward to refuting this groundless complaint in
a full evidentiary hearing,”  Sena Fitzmaurice , a Washington-
based spokeswoman for Comcast, said in an e-mailed statement.  Tennis Channel is available to almost every home
Philadelphia-based Comcast serves, Fitzmaurice said.  “We are fully honoring the terms of our agreement with
Tennis Channel” by carrying it as part of a sports package,
Fitzmaurice said.  Comcast has caused “significant harm” to Tennis Channel,
 Eric Abner , a spokesman representing the Los Angeles-based
network, said in an e-mailed statement.  “When the matter is finally resolved, Comcast will have
been found definitively to have illegally discriminated against
Tennis Channel and in favor of its owned sports services,”
Abner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
