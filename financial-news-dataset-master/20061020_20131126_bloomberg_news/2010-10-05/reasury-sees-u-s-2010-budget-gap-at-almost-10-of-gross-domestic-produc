The U.S. government’s deficit in the
fiscal year 2010, which ended Sept. 30, will be almost as big a
share of the economy as the $1.4 trillion 2009 shortfall, a U.S.
Treasury official said today.  “Due to the deep economic recession, there has been a
large imbalance between revenues and expenditures, which caused
the fiscal deficit to reach nearly 10 percent of GDP in fiscal
year 2009,” said Mary Miller, assistant secretary for financial
markets, referring to the economy’s size as measured by gross
domestic product. “We expect this year’s deficit to be a
similar or slightly lower percentage of GDP,” Miller said.  Miller also said that the Federal Reserve’s decision to
purchase Treasury securities in the secondary market will not
affect debt management. She spoke in the text of remarks
prepared for a Futures Industry Association conference in New
York.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
