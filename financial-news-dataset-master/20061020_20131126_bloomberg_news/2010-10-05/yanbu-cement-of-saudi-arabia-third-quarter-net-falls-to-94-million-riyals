Yanbu Cement , a Saudi Arabian cement
maker, said third-quarter profit declined 4.1 percent on lower
sales and production.  Net income fell to 94 million riyals ($25.1 million), from
98 million riyals a year ago, the Jeddah, Saudi Arabia-based
company said in a statement on the  Saudi bourse  website today.
Third-quarter operating profit dropped 5.8 percent to 97 million
riyals.  Saudi cement production declined 5.6 percent in August to
3.05 million tons, compared with 3.23 million tons during the
same month last year, according to industry data provided on the
website of  Yamamah Saudi Cement Co . Exports dropped 4.3 percent
to 134,000 tons in August, according to the data.  Only one cement company listed on the Saudi stock exchange
reported an increase in cement production in August, NCB Capital
said in a report last month. Saudi Arabia has 13 cement
companies with an estimated annual cement production capacity of
49 million tons, according to NCB Capital.  Yanbu’s nine-month earnings per share were 3.15 riyals,
compared with 3.81 riyals in the year earlier period, the
company said in the statement. It didn’t provide third-quarter
earnings per share.  “The decline in the quantity and value of sales is a
result of intense competition from the entry of new cement
companies and a near doubling of capacity, plus the ban on
export,” the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
