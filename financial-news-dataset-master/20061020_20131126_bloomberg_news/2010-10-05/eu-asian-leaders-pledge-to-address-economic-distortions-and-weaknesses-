European Union and Asian leaders
pledged to deal with “economic distortions and weaknesses” as
they try to steer the world economy back to health, according to
a communique issued after a two-day summit in Brussels.  The leaders also welcomed “the measures taken by European
members to ensure a proper functioning of the market for
sovereign debt and their readiness to go further if warranted,”
the communiqué said.  While the leaders vowed to pursue policies that avoid
“possible spillover effects and imbalances,” the communiqué
made no direct reference to exchange rates.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
