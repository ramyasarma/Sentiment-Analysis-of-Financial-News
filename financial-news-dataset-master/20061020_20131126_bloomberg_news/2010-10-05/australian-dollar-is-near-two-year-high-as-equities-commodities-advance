The Australian dollar traded near a
two-year high against the U.S. currency after commodities and
stocks rose world wide, boosting demand for growth-sensitive
currencies.  New Zealand’s dollar was close to the strongest in almost
11 months on speculation the Federal Reserve will increase
purchases of government debt to spur growth. The so-called
Aussie touched a two-week low against the New Zealand dollar
yesterday after Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  unexpectedly
kept Australia’s benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent.  “The Fed is still likely to pump billions of billions of
dollars into the system,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. “All that
liquidity has to find a place. Some of that will stay in the
U.S. and some of that will inevitable try to find a better yield
somewhere. Part of that will be the Aussie dollar.”  Australia’s currency traded at 97.17 U.S. cents at 10:12
a.m. from 97.17 cents in New York yesterday. It touched 97.51
U.S. cents on Oct. 1, the highest level since July 2008. The
Aussie was at 80.88 yen from 80.87 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fetched 74.81
U.S. cents from 74.93 cents. It touched 74.99 cents yesterday,
the strongest level since November 2009. The currency was at
62.27 yen from 62.36 yen.  The  MSCI World Index  rose 2 percent to the highest level
since May and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
advanced 1.6 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week that the
central bank’s first round of large-scale asset purchases that
ended in March improved the economy and that further buying is
likely to help more. New York Fed President  William Dudley  said
on Oct. 1 that the central bank has the “tools that can provide
additional stimulus at costs that do not appear to be
prohibitive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
