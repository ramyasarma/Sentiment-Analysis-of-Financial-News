Kazakhstan may increase oil exports
18 percent to at least 80 million tons a year starting in 2020
from 68 million tons this year, said Oil & Gas Minister Sauat
Mynbayev.  The Central Asian country plans to raise output to 130
million tons in 2020 from 81 million tons this year, providing
enough crude to raise exports for the next 40 to 50 years,
Mynbayev said today at a conference in Astana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
