Canadian stocks  fell from a two-year
high after a private report showed U.S. employers cut more
workers and a survey said Research In Motion Ltd. lost ground in
U.S. smartphone market share.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. fell 1.4 percent after
comments by the province’s energy and resources minister raised
concern BHP Billiton’s bid to buy the fertilizer maker would be
blocked by the government. BlackBerry maker RIM dropped 4.4
percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  slipped 36.34
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,461.66 at 3:08 p.m. in Toronto.  “Unemployment is not really melting away the way you would
have expected it might at this point,” said  Doug Davis , chief
executive officer of Davis-Rea Ltd. in Toronto, which manages
about C$400 million ($396 million).  The equity benchmark soared 13 percent in the three months
ending yesterday thanks to a  25 percent surge  in its raw-
materials stocks. Gold prices jumped 11 percent during the
period as investors contemplated a new round of central-bank
stimulus policies to recharge the economy.  U.S. employment declined by 39,000 last month, ADP Employer
Services said today, compared with a gain of 10,000 in revised
figures from August. Three of 37 economists in a Bloomberg
survey had forecast a decrease in jobs for September.  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  fell after climbing the most
in five weeks yesterday.  U.S. Branches  Insurer Sun Life Financial Inc., which derived  47 percent 
of its revenue from the U.S. last year, declined 1.3 percent to
C$26.77. Manulife Financial Corp., North America’s third-largest
insurer, lost 3.1 percent to C$12.55. Toronto-Dominion Bank,
which has about 1,300 U.S. branches, dropped 0.5 percent to
C$74.92.  RIM decreased 4.4 percent to $48.36 after market-research
firm comScore Inc. said its share of the U.S. smartphone market
slumped to 38 percent from 42 percent in May. Only Google Inc.’s
Android operating system gained share among the top five
smartphone platforms.  Potash Corp., the world’s largest fertilizer producer,
retreated 1.4 percent to C$143.31.  Bill Boyd , Saskatchewan’s
energy and resources minister, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview that BHP Billiton’s $40 billion bid for Potash Corp.
doesn’t appear to be of “net benefit” to his province.  Canada’s federal government can block foreign takeovers if
it finds they are not of “net benefit” to the country.  Gold Advances  Gold futures rose 0.6 percent from a record close on
speculation that government and central bank stimulus policies
will weaken currencies.  Barrick Gold Corp. gained 1.5 percent to C$48.92. Goldcorp
Inc., the world’s second-largest producer of the metal by market
value, advanced 1.7 percent to C$45.61. Colossus Minerals Inc.,
which explores for precious metals in Brazil, rose 2.5 percent
to C$8.56 after announcing drilling results it called a
“success.”  Air Canada, the country’s biggest airline, jumped 8.4
percent to C$3.11, after hitting C$3.25, the highest intraday
price since November 2008, after saying September traffic
increased 12 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
