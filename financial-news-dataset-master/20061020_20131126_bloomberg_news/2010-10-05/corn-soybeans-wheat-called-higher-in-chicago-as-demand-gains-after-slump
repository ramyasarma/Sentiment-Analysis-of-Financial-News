What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 6 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand rebounds
following last week’s 11 percent price plunge, said  Greg Grow ,
the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago after yesterday’s drop to a two-week low revived
demand for U.S. supplies, Grow said. Soybean-meal futures may
open $2 to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is
expected to open up 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound.  -- Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as demand climbs after prices fell for six
straight sessions, the longest slump since early June, Grow
said. Dry weather in Australia may also boost purchases of U.S.
grain, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
