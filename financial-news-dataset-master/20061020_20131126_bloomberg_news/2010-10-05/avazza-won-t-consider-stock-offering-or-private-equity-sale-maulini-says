Luigi Lavazza SpA, the coffee company
founded by Italy’s Lavazza family in 1895, will never consider
an initial public offering or a sale to private-equity funds,
Director of Business Development Luca Maulini said.  “Bankers and managers have approached Mr. Lavazza in
recent years to propose deals that would dilute capital,”
Maulini said at conference in Milan today. “He never even offers
them a coffee.”  The Turin, Italy-based company is considering acquisitions
in four or five markets including India, China, Brazil and the
U.S. to expand its business, Maulini said, without providing
details.  Lavazza agreed to buy a 6 percent stake in Green Mountain
Coffee Roasters Inc. in August to expand in the U.S. The two
companies said in a statement at that time that they’ll jointly
develop new single-serve espresso machines and capsules and that
Green Mountain may agree to sell Lavazza’s existing machines in
the U.S. and Canada.  Lavazza’s sales fell to 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in
2009 from 1.12 billion euros the year before, according to
figures in the statement and on its  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
