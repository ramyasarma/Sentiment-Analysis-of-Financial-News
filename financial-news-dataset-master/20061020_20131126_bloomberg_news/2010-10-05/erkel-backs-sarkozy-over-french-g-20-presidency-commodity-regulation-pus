German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
she backs French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plan to discuss
exchange rates and rules for commodity markets during his
presidency of the Group of 20.  “The French president made it clear that his G-20
presidency will have three main topics, one of them being
commodities speculation, and I supported him on this,” Merkel
said in Brussels today during a meeting of leaders from the
European Union and Asia.  “This can be an important topic for next year, along with
the future of a global currency order with real exchange
rates,” she told reporters, according to a transcript provided
by her press secretary’s office in Berlin.  Sarkozy, who presides over the euro region’s second-
largest economy, has called for debate on the “dominance” of
the U.S. dollar and extending regulation to commodity markets.
China and Japan support his effort, a French official said in
Brussels yesterday.  France’s G-20 presidency starts in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
