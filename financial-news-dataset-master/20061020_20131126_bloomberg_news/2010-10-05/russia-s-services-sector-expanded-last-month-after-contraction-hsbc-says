(Corrects to show survey is for Russian services.)  Russia’s services sector improved in
September following a contraction in the prior month due to a
heatwave, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The seasonally adjusted Business Activity Index rose to
51.5 in September from 47.0 in August, HSBC said in a report
today, citing data compiled by Markit Economics. The survey-
based index indicates a contraction when it is below 50 and
growth with a figure above 50.  Russia’s economic recovery from last year’s 7.9 percent
contraction, the biggest on record, remains uneven, the central
bank said.  “Growth momentum is weak, lagging behind the levels seen
just a few months ago,” said  Alexander Morozov,  chief economist
at HSBC in Moscow, in the statement. “There appears to be low
immediate potential for further economic growth acceleration
from the August trough, as follows from the relatively low
composite new orders index.”  Gross domestic product may expand as little as 3.6 percent
in 2010, Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said on Sept.
24. The government left its official GDP forecast for this year
unchanged at 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
