Sugar prices rose the most in a week
following a lower estimate for the cane crop in Brazil, the
world’s largest producer. Coffee also gained, and cocoa
declined.  Brazil will harvest 639 million metric tons of sugar cane
in the year that started May 1, the Sao Paulo unit of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. That was down 3.2
percent from an April estimate. Raw-sugar futures have jumped 83
percent from a 13-month low on May 7, partly on concern that
adverse weather reduced the Brazilian crop.  The latest forecast “can be perceived as bullish,” said
 Naim Beydoun , a broker at Rolle, Switzerland-based Swiss Sugar
Brokers. “It will confirm what most market folks have been
expecting.”  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.75 cent, or 3.3
percent, to settle at 23.74 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York, the biggest gain since Sept 24. The
price declined 9.1 percent in the past four sessions.  “The situation is pretty delicate,” said  Bruno Lima , a
risk-management consultant at FCStone in Campinas, Brazil.
Prices should rise to 26 cents by the end of the year, he said.  In London, white-sugar futures for December delivery
climbed $17.60, or 2.9 percent, to $623.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  In New York, arabica-coffee futures for December delivery
rose 3.95 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $1.7645 a pound. Robusta-
coffee futures for November delivery climbed $6, or 0.4 percent,
to $1,640 a ton in London.  Cocoa futures for December delivery declined $22, or 0.8
percent, to $2,714 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures
for December delivery declined 19 pounds, or 1 percent, to 1,828
pounds ($2,906) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
