  Tera Software Ltd. , an Indian
technology company whose market value surged 50 percent in two
weeks, plans to sell stock to buy equipment after it wins orders
from the country’s first nationwide identity card project.  Tera plans to raise as much as 800 million rupees ($18
million) to buy materials for contracts valued at 5 billion
rupees from the  Unique Identification Authority of India ,
Managing Director  T. Gopichand  said in a phone interview.  Billionaire  Nandan Nilekani  is heading a government project
to help the world’s second-most populated country provide access
to banking services and food subsidies to the poorest, who are
often excluded because they can’t prove their identity. Tera and
rivals are competing to win contracts to build the database that
will include names, dates of birth and iris scans.  “We are not focusing anything else except UID projects as
it requires lot of manpower and equipments,” Gopichand said.
“These order will not come in a single day, they will come over
a period of one year” and help increase revenue fourfold to 4
billion rupees by the year ending March 31, 2013, he said.  Tera in the year starting April 1 plans to use the money
from the stock sale to build a wafer-manufacturing facility in
Hyderabad for the UID project.  The company’s shares  slumped  as much as 7 percent to 59.4
rupees in Mumbai, the biggest decline in almost two months. The
stock jumped 15 percent to 63.9 rupees yesterday.  Nilekani plans to issue identity cards to 600 million
people in five years, he said Jan. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
