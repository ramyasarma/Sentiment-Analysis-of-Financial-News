Tyson Foods Inc.  put trading soared
to the highest level since June 2008 after a single trade by an
investor betting that the largest U.S. meat processor won’t fall
below $15 in the next month.  More than 32,000 puts to sell the stock  changed hands , 20
times the four-week average and 99 times the number of calls to
buy the stock. The shares rose 2.3 percent to $16.13 at 4 p.m.
in New York. Selling a put is a bet that the stock will rise,
allowing the seller to keep the premium paid.  An investor sold 29,570 November $15 puts, which before
today had an open interest of 1,248 outstanding contracts,
according to  Frederic Ruffy , senior options strategist at
WhatsTrading.com, a New York-based provider of options-market
analysis. Next month’s options expire Nov. 19. Shares of the
Springdale, Arkansas-based company haven’t closed below $15
since February.  “Someone bullish sold a large block of puts in a play on
the stock at least holding steady if not moving higher from now
through November,” Ruffy said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
