Only eight “free schools” are on
course to open next year in the U.K. government’s flagship
education program, according to a Department for Education
document.  Education Secretary  Michael Gove  said in April that he
wanted to open  “between 50 and 100”  of the schools each year.
He told his Conservative Party’s annual conference in
Birmingham, central England, yesterday that he had received
“more than 100” applications to open such schools. They would
be run by parents, teachers, charities or businesses, rather
than by local governments.  “Sixteen of those applications are already on course to
open and more are poised to follow,” Gove said. “No school
reform program in England has ever proceeded at such a pace
before.” Gove didn’t give any date for when they would open.  In a document giving internal assessment of the program’s
current status, seen by Bloomberg News, Gove’s department says
the majority of the 16 are likely to miss deadlines, including
identifying the buildings they will use, that they would have to
meet in order to open in time for the new school year in
September 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
