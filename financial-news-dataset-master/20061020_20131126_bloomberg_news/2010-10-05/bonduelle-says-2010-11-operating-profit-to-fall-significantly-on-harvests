Bonduelle SCA, a producer of canned
and frozen food, said operating profit will decline
significantly in 2010-11, hurt by difficult harvests and cost
overruns.  Full-year net income for 2009-2010 rose to 58.3 million
euros from 26.6 million euros, the company said in a statement
published on Hugin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
