U.S. stocks extended gains after a
gauge of service industries showed stronger-than-forecast
growth, tempering concern the economy may slip back into a
recession.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1.2 percent to
1,151.04 at 10:02 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average surged 112.73 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,864.00.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses, which covers about 90 percent of the
economy, rose to 53.2 from 51.5 in August. The gauge, where
readings greater than 50 signal growth, averaged 55.3 during the
six-year expansion that ended in December 2007.  The S&P 500 has rallied 12 percent from this year’s low in
July, leaving it up about 3 percent for 2010, amid speculation
the economy will avoid relapsing into another recession as the
Federal Reserve pledges to protect growth.   Analysts are cutting forecasts for S&P 500 earnings for the
first time in more than a year, jeopardizing gains from the
biggest September rally since World War II. Estimates for S&P
500 companies’ combined 2011 profit fell to as low as $95.17 a
share last month from an August high of $96.16 and booked the
first quarterly reduction since the three months ended June
2009, according to forecasts tracked by Bloomberg.  The revision came even as the benchmark gauge for U.S.
equities rose 8.8 percent last month, the largest September
advance since 1939.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
