President  Hugo Chavez  said some of
Venezuela’s golf courses should be expropriated and used for
other purposes.  “That’s an injustice -- that someone should have the
luxury of having I don’t know how many hectares to play golf and
drink whiskey and, next door, there’s misery and children dying
when there are landslides,” Chavez said during his weekly
television show, “Alo, Presidente.”  Dozens of people died in the past month when landslides
caused their homes to collapse after heavy rains. Chavez said he
will dedicate himself to resolving Venezuela’s housing shortage.  Chavez also called on Venezuelans to actively look for
abandoned private land to expropriate.  “Look for irregularities, and by that I mean good land
that’s been abandoned,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
