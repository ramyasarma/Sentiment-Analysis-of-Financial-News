Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will
reduce its forecasts for harvests that farmers have nearly
completed.  Sixteen of 27 traders and analysts surveyed from Chicago to
Tokyo on Oct. 29 said corn will climb, and 15 respondents said
soybeans will advance. Last week, corn futures for December
delivery rose 3.9 percent to $5.82 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Soybean futures for January delivery climbed 2 percent
to $12.36 a bushel. The USDA will issue its crop projections on
Nov. 9.  Last week’s gains were expected by the majority of
respondents surveyed on Oct. 22. Since 2004, the surveys have
been correct 51 percent of the time for corn and 53 percent for
soybeans.  Bullish  on corn: 16   Bullish  on soybeans: 15
