England’s Lee Westwood will replace
Tiger Woods at No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings after
today’s Andalucia Valderrama Masters.   Neither player was taking part in the Spanish event, where
Martin Kaymer had to finish in the top two to take the No. 1
spot.  The German, who’s already finished his last round, ended
down the field on 7-over par. Ireland’s Damien McGrane and
Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell lead the field on 4-under
after 14 holes.  Woods has led the standings for 281 weeks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
