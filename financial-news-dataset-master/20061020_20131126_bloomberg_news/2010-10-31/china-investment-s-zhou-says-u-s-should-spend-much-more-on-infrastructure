U.S. infrastructure-spending plans
are “too little, too late” and should be increased in
preference to quantitative easing, said  Zhou Yuan , head of asset
allocation at China’s $300 billion sovereign wealth fund.  Proposed spending of about $500 billion over six years on
infrastructure should be doubled, Zhou said in an interview on
Oct. 30.  China Investment Corp.  may invest, and wouldn’t expect
to own completed projects, he said.  “Infrastructure of this kind will serve to provide more
jobs” than further quantitative easing, Zhou said in New York,
while attending a conference hosted by the Chinese Finance
Association. Low interest rates in the U.S. are his “top
concern,” he said.  Congress has yet to approve the proposed $500 billion of
spending on highways and transit. Transportation Secretary  Ray LaHood  said Oct. 12 he hoped Congress would make the plan a
priority next year.  Beijing-based CIC was created in September 2007, funded by
a $200 billion allocation backed by China’s foreign reserves.  Zhou said the fund has depleted its cash to the point where
it’s seeking more government money. About 8.6 percent of the
portfolio was in cash as of June 9, according to Executive Vice
President  Jesse Wang . Cash and equivalents were 32 percent of
holdings at the end of 2009, according to its annual report.  “We are expecting continued injections,” Zhou said. “The
form, quantity and structure remain to be determined.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
