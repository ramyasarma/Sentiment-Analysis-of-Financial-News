results.  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF IM), the controlling
shareholder of Italian insurance company Fondiaria-SAI SpA,
dropped 6.1 percent to 1.01 euros, the biggest loss since June

“despite restructuring expectations following top management
changes, our stance is based on our beliefs that consensus is
too high and on low profitability expected for a prolonged
period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
