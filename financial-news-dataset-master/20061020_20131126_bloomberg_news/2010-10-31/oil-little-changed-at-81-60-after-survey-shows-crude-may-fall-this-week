Oil rose in New York as the dollar
declined on speculation the Federal Reserve will announce
another round of credit-easing measures to help spur growth in
the U.S., the world’s largest crude user.  Futures gained as much as 0.7 percent as the U.S. currency
weakened for a third day. Policy makers may announce a new round
of large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing, when
they meet tomorrow. Manufacturing in China expanded in October
at the fastest pace in six months, adding to signs that economic
growth is withstanding cooling efforts by the government.  “As people feel the GDP number we had on Friday was OK,
and quantitative easing will support that recovery, then more
dollar weakness will come initially,” said  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.
“That will help support the price of crude.”  Oil for December delivery rose as much as 53 cents to
$81.96 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It was at $81.84 at 4:05 p.m. Singapore time. On Oct.
29, the contract dropped 0.9 percent to $81.43, trimming the
advance in October to 1.8 percent.  The dollar dropped for a third day against the 16-nation
euro, reaching $1.4011 per euro from $1.3947 in New York on Oct.
29. A weaker U.S. currency increases the appeal of commodities
as an alternative investment.  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate
in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Oct. 29. The
central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee will meet in
Washington on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3.  Economic Recovery  Oil has climbed 3.1 percent this year on a weaker dollar
and speculation a global economic rebound would boost demand for
fuel.  China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  rose to 54.7 in October,
the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. That’s
higher than 53.8 for both the previous month and the median
forecast from 13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
country overtook the U.S. last year as the biggest energy user.  U.S.  crude stockpiles  surged 5 million barrels to 366.2
million in the week ended Oct. 22, the most since July,
according to an Energy Department report last week. Oil prices
may fall this week as rising supplies threatened a glut, based
on a Bloomberg News survey.  “We have seen an increase in inventories, that remains an
issue,” said Barratt at Commodity Broking Services. Still, the
market is focused on the possibility of more quantitative
easing, he said.  Brent crude for December settlement rose as much as 30
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $83.45 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange. On Oct. 29, the contract dropped 44
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $83.15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
