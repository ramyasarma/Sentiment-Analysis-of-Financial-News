Marks & Spencer Group Plc  plans to
buy back some of the 38 stores in continental Europe that it
sold in 2001, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The retailer has approached El Corte Ingles SA regarding
nine stores it sold to the Spanish chain, and is considering re-
acquiring some of the 18 outlets sold to Galeries Lafayette SA
of France, according to the Telegraph. Marks & Spencer Chief
Executive Officer  Marc Bolland  may outline the plan this week,
the newspaper said.  The company was paid 150 million euros ($209 million) for
nine shops sold to El Corte Ingles in 2001, The Telegraph
reported.  A Marks & Spencer spokesman declined to comment to
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
