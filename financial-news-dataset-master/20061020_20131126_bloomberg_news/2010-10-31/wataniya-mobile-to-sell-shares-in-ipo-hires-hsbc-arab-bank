Wataniya Palestine Mobile 
Telecommunications Public Shareholding Co., known as Wataniya
Mobile, plans to raise $50.3 million by selling 15 percent of
its shares in an initial public offering.  The stock will be sold at $1.30 apiece from Nov. 7 to Dec.
2, the company said in an e-mailed statement. HSBC Bank Middle
East Ltd. will be the global coordinator and bookrunner for the
IPO, while Arab Bank Group will be the regional coordinator.  "There is still a lot of potential for growth in our home
market," Wataniya Mobile Chief Executive Officer Bassam Hannoun
said in a telephone interview today. "That’s why we’ve chosen to
sell shares now." Wataniya Mobile plans to sell 38.7 million
shares and proceeds from the sale will be used for network
expansion, Hannoun said.  Middle East companies are joining a surge in share sales in
the emerging markets as stock markets rebound and companies
restructure their debt. Nawras, the Omani mobile phone company,
will start trading shares from Nov. 1. Aluminium Bahrain BSC is
seeking to raise as much as 204 million dinar ($541 million)
from an initial share sale and Axiom Telecom LLC, a unit of a
Dubai-based phone retailer, plans to sell a 35 percent stake in
an IPO by the end of the year.  Wataniya Mobile, the second mobile phone company in the
Palestinian territories, started operations in November 2009.
Since then its subscriber base has risen to 302,000 from
110,000, Hannoun said. The company increased its market share to
19.2 percent at the end of third quarter from 9.3 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year.  The share sale will give Wataniya Mobile a market
capitalization of $335.4 million, and the company will list its
shares on the  Palestine Exchange , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
