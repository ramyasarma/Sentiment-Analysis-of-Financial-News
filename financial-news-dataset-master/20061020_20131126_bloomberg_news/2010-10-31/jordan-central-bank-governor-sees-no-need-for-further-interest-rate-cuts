The Jordanian central bank sees no
need to cut interest rates further to stimulate economic growth,
Governor  Umayya Toukan  said.  “Interest rates are at 2 percent and I don’t think there
is a necessity to use this again,” he said today in an
interview at an economic conference in Kuwait, referring to the
overnight window rate.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the Middle East,
imports more than 90 percent of its oil and relies on foreign
investment and grants. The economy of the Arab country may
expand at about 4 percent this year and in 2011, Toukan said.  “There is momentum of course but before the crisis our
growth rates were 7 percent,” he said. “Things are going back
to normal but only gradually.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
