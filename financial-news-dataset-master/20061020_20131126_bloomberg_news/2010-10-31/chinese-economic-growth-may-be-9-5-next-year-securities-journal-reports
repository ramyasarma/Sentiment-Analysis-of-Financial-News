China’s economy may grow 9.5 percent
in 2011, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing
estimates by Fan Jianping, chief economist at the State
Information Center.  China may keep a moderately loose monetary policy stance
and maintain new loan growth at 7.5 trillion yuan next year, the
Beijing-based newspaper reported, citing Fan. The nation’s 2011
trade surplus may narrow by about 19 percent from this year to
$140 billion, Fan was cited as saying.  The State Information Center is a research agency under the
National Development and Reform Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
