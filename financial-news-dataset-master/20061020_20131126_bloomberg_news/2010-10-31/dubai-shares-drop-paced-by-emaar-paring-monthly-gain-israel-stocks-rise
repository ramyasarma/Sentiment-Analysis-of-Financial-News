Dubai shares fell from a six-month
high, leading a decline in Middle East markets, on investor
speculation that gains are overdone given prospects for profit
growth.  Emaar Properties PJSC , the builder of the world’s tallest
tower, retreated 1.5 percent, paring the gain for the month to
3.2 percent.  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC  fell for the fourth time in
five days. Dubai’s  DFM General Index  lost 0.7 percent to
1,764.54 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The benchmark index
has gained 4.8 percent this month and closed at a more than six-
month high on Oct. 28. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  of 200
companies in the Persian Gulf dropped 0.2 percent, while
Israel’s TA-25 Index rose 0.3 percent.  There is some “profit taking” after shares reached a six-
month high last session, said  Adnan Haider , head of fixed income
and equities at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. “Also, continued
uncertainty in global markets,” is pushing local stocks lower.  The October gains left the 32 companies in Dubai’s
benchmark index valued at 14.7 times earnings, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That compares with 12.1 times for Abu Dhabi’s
benchmark index and 11.8 times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index .  Asian  stocks  fell for a second week on concern earnings
growth will slow and possible asset purchases by the Federal
Reserve may disappoint investors. In Europe, stocks had the
first weekly decline in four weeks.  Israeli Yields Fall  Emaar retreated to 3.85 dirhams. DIB, the biggest shariah-
compliant lender in the United Arab Emirates, lost 1.6 percent
to 2.40 dirhams. The shares have gained 5.3 percent in October.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index  and Kuwait’s  gauge  slipped
less than 0.1 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index  fell 0.4 percent and
Qatar’s  QE Index  lost 0.1 percent. Bahrain’s  measure  and Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  were little changed. Egypt’s
 EGX 30  dropped 0.4 percent.  Israeli government bonds rose, pushing yields down the most
in more than three weeks, on bets the Federal Reserve will
increase bond purchases to boost economic growth. The yield on
the benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due in January 2020
dropped 5 basis points to 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
