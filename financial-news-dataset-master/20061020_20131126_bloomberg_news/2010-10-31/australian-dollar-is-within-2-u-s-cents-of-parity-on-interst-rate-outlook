Australia’s dollar rose for a third
day against the greenback on speculation the South Pacific
nation will maintain its interest-rate premium as the U.S. and
Japan consider further monetary-easing measures this week.  The Australian currency climbed to within two U.S. cents of
parity and New Zealand’s reached the strongest in more than two
years amid speculation the Federal Reserve will announce
increased bond purchases after its Nov. 2-3 meeting. The Bank of
Japan meets Nov. 4-5. Both South Pacific currencies also gained
versus the yen after China said manufacturing accelerated in
October, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  “U.S. yields will stay low and that will be good for stock
markets, feeding through to risk,” said  Kurt Magnus , executive
director of foreign-exchange sales at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
Sydney. “The RBA is the most proactive central bank in the
world,” said Magnus, who favors buying the Aussie  “on dips.”  Australia’s currency gained 0.3 percent to 98.65 U.S. cents
at 12:34 p.m. in New York, from 98.35 cents on Oct. 29. It
touched parity with the greenback on Oct. 15 for the first time
since the currency was floated in 1983. The Aussie rose 0.6
percent to 79.59 yen, from 79.08.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 76.68 U.S. cents, compared
with 76.65. It earlier rose to 76.93, the highest since July
2008. The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced 0.4 percent to
61.86 yen.  Australian Central Bank  The Reserve Bank of Australia will increase its benchmark
interest rate by 45 basis points over the next 12 months,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index  based on swaps
trading.  Seventeen of 23 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey 
predict central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board will
leave the cash rate target at 4.5 percent tomorrow. The others
forecast an increase to 4.75 percent.  Nomura’s Magnus forecast the RBA will increase its key rate
by 25 basis points this week, helping the Aussie rise as high as
$1.035 by January.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 54.7, the
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said, compared with the
median forecast for 53.8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
