Chongqing Changan Automobile Co .
will double its 2012 production by 2020, the Chinese carmaker
said today.  Chongqing Changan aims to make 6 million cars in 2020, 30
percent of which will be new energy cars, chairman  Xu Liuping 
said at a press conference in Beijing today. The 6 million goal
would double the company’s production target of 3 million in
2012, according to Xu.  Chongqing Changan is also working with Ford Motor Co. on a
10-year development plan in China, Xu told reporters in Beijing
today, without giving details.  Chongqing Changan, whose parent company has passenger car
ventures with Paris-based PSA  Peugeot Citroen  and  Ford Motor
Co.,  is looking to develop its own-brand vehicles as China aims
to increase the market share of vehicles developed by local
automakers.  China’s government wants domestic carmakers to raise their
market share in the nation to over 50 percent, the Shanghai
Securities News reported Oct. 22, citing a draft of the plan. It
didn’t specify a timeframe.  Shenzhen-listed Chongqing Changan boosted September sales
in China 13 percent to 149,008 vehicles.  Sales in the world’s largest automarket accelerated as car
dealers offered discounts to clear rising inventories. Wholesale
deliveries of passenger vehicles rose 19 percent to 1.21 million
units in September, according to the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers.  Hybrid Development  Chongqing Changan, based in Sichuan province in southwest
China, said quarterly profit rose 15.8 percent from a year
earlier to 353 million yuan ($53 million), according to a
statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Oct. 29.  The automaker said this month it will invest 11.5 billion
yuan in a passenger-vehicle venture in Beijing. The project,
pending board approval, may produce 500,000 vehicles and 500,000
engines a year, the company said in a statement.  Chongqing Changan will invest in hybrid and electric
vehicle development, president  Zhang Baolin  said at a forum in
China last month.  Auto sales in China may reach 17 million units this year,
 Zhu Hongren , the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology’s chief engineer, said in Beijing Oct 28.  -- Liza Lin ,  Zheng Lifei , Eva Woo. Editors:  Ian Rowley , Tom Kohn  To contact the reporter on this story:
