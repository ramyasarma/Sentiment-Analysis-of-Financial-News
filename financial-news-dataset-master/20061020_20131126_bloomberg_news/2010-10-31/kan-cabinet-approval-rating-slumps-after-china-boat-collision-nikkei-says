Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s
voter approval rating slumped after a collision between the
Coast Guard and a Chinese trawler in disputed waters damaged
relations, according to a poll conducted by the Nikkei newspaper
and TV Tokyo Corp.  Support for Kan’s Cabinet dropped 31 percentage points to
40 percent from a September survey. The disapproval rating rose
24 points to 48 percent.  The ruling Democratic Party of Japan has public support of
37 percent, compared with 26 percent for the opposition Liberal
Democratic Party, the newspaper said.  The telephone survey received valid responses from 62
percent of 1,496 households contacted Oct. 29-31. A margin of
error wasn’t provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
