Britain’s International Power Plc
rejected a $20 billion merger offer from AES Corp. days before
agreeing on a deal with GDF Suez, the  Sunday Times reported ,
citing people it didn’t identify.  The times said AES may consider reviving the offer if the
merger between  International Power  and GDF, which is awaiting
approval from competition regulators, fails. The all-share
merger proposed by AES would have created the world’s largest
independent power producer, listed in New York and London, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
