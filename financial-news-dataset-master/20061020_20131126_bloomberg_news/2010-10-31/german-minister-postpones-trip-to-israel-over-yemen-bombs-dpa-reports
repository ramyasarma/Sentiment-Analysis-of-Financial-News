German Interior Minister  Thomas de Maiziere  postponed a planned trip to Israel as authorities
investigate an attempt to send parcel bombs from Yemen to the
U.S., DPA reported.  German authorities passed on a warning from a “friendly
intelligence service” to the U.K. sometime between the evening
of Oct. 28 and the next morning about a bomb in a U.S.-bound
package, the news agency quoted De Maiziere as saying in Dresden
today. One of the packages landed in Germany on its way to the
U.S. via the U.K., the news agency quoted De Maiziere as saying.  The minister had been scheduled to begin a trip to
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ramallah today, staying in Israel until
Nov. 2 and meeting with Israeli President  Shimon Peres . The trip
will be rescheduled as soon as possible, DPA said.  Police in Yemen yesterday arrested a woman suspected of
attempting to send two parcel bombs to synagogues in Chicago via
air cargo, after authorities in Dubai and the U.K. intercepted
the packages on Oct. 29. Germany today banned all air freight
and airmail packages from Yemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
