Barcelona may bid for Tottenham
midfielder Luka Modric after becoming frustrated in its attempts
to sign Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal, the Mail on Sunday reported.  Primera Liga soccer champion Barcelona is ready to offer
Tottenham double the 16.5 million pounds ($26.5 million) it cost
to sign the 25-year-old Modric two years ago, the newspaper
said, without citing anyone.  Tottenham coach Harry Redknapp would be reluctant to sell
Modric, although the club may be tempted by such an offer, the
Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
