Iran has changed some 15 percent of
its foreign exchange reserves into gold and will not need to
import the metal for the next ten years,  Mehr  reported, citing
Central Bank Governor  Mahmoud Bahmani .  Iran’s gold reserves have “multiplied several times” in
the past two years, Bahmani said in a report published late
yesterday by the state-run news agency.  Bahmani gave no specific figures, only saying the country
consumes 30 tons of gold a year and that the central bank will
have “ample supplies for the next 10 years” even if it doesn’t
increase its gold holdings further.  Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said yesterday his
country’s foreign exchange reserves exceed $100 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
