Total SA  is “confident” it will
continue to be a partner with Abu Dhabi in developing the
Persian Gulf emirate’s oil reserves after its current production
concession expires, an official at the French company said.  “We are confident that the track record of the
relationship between Total and Abu Dhabi will continue with a
renewed partnership after 2014,”  Jean Luc Guiziou , Total’s vice
president for production in the Middle East, told reporters on
the sidelines of a conference today. “We are confident we will
be one of the strategic partners” developing Abu Dhabi’s crude,
he said.  Abu Dhabi, the capital and largest sheikhdom of the United
Arab Emirates, is seeking to boost crude production capacity to
3.5 million barrels a day by 2018. State companies partner with
international companies in fuel-producing concessions to develop
on- and offshore oil and gas deposits.  The French producer and other international partners have
the concession for pumping crude from six onshore fields through
the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations.  The state-run oil producer owns 60 percent of Adco, as the
partnership is known, with Total,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. ,  BP Plc  and Partex holding the rest. Adco will raise
its sustainable production capacity to 1.8 million barrels a day
starting in 2017 from about 1.4 million barrels a day, General
Manager Abdul Munim Saif al-Kindy said Feb. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
