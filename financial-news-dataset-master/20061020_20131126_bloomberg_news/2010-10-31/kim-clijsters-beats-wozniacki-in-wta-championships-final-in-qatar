U.S. Open champion  Kim Clijsters  of
Belgium defeated Denmark’s  Caroline Wozniacki  6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in
the final of tennis’s WTA Championships in Doha, Qatar, today.  It’s the third time 27-year-old Clijsters has won the
season-ending competition after victories in 2002 and 2003. She
takes $1.45 million in prize money.  “At the moment I’m kind of relieved it’s over. It seemed
like it would never end,” Clijsters was cited as saying on the
 WTA website . “It was a tough battle. We showed some great
tennis and some great fitness. This was my first time in the
Middle East and it was an amazing experience.”  After fighting back from 4-1 down to win the second set,
Wozniacki broke serve in the opening game of the decider, only
for the Belgian to break twice as she moved to victory.  It was Clijsters’s fifth WTA title this year, following
successes in Brisbane, Miami, Cincinnati and the U.S. Open,
where she won for the second straight year and the third in all.  She achieved her 2009 U.S. Open win, beating Wozniacki in
the final, soon after coming out of retirement during which she
got married and had a baby girl.  World No. 1 Wozniacki, with six titles, is the only player
to top Clijsters’s haul this season, although she hasn’t taken a
major.  To contact the reporter on this story:
