The U.S. Defense Department has
concluded that China’s monopoly on rare-earth materials, used in
military hardware such as missile guidance and radar systems,
poses no threat to national security, according to a person
familiar with a year-long study by the Pentagon.  The report notes that rising prices and supply
uncertainties are spurring private investment in new mining
operations outside of China that will help meet American
military needs, which require less than 5 percent of U.S. rare-
earth consumption.  China now provides 97 percent of the world’s rare earths, a
group of 17 metals that includes neodymium, samarium, and
dysprosium.  Global Trade  China  needs to take steps to boost domestic demand rather
than let the currency appreciate to improve global trade, said
Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim .  Slim in an interview in New York also said competitive
devaluations “won’t succeed” and could spur inflation should
commodity prices remain high.  “If China salaries get increased and people work less they
will have more time and more money to spend,” Slim, the world’s
richest man according to Forbes magazine, said. “This domestic
demand will also help other countries in the world.”  Futures Risks Curbed  China’s move to increase margin limits on agricultural
futures including rubber and rice is aimed at curbing trading
risks and containing  inflation  as prices surge, an analyst at
Wanda Futures Co. said.  “The moves were aimed at cracking down on speculation,
basically their way of discouraging speculative money from
flowing into the exchange-traded commodities,”  Axl Wang ,
Beijing research manager, at Wanda said by phone. The Shanghai
Futures Exchange increased the margin limits on natural rubber
to 11 percent from 8 percent.  China Pledges Rare Earth Supply  China pledged to supply Japan and other countries with
rare-earth metals, sales of which were reportedly disrupted last
month during a territorial dispute that soured relations between
Asia’s two largest economies.  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  made the vow during a trilateral
meeting with counterparts from Japan and South Korea, Kim Hee
Jung, a spokeswoman for South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak ,
told reporters in Hanoi Oct. 29. All three are attending
meetings in Vietnam hosted by the  Association of Southeast Asian
Nations .  Construction Bank Earnings  China Construction Bank Corp., the world’s second-largest
lender by market value, posted a 31 percent increase in third-
quarter profit, fueled by rising demand for credit and a
decrease in non-performing loans.  Net income climbed to 39.8 billion yuan ($6 billion), or
0.17 yuan a share, from 30.3 billion yuan, or 0.13 yuan, the
Beijing-based bank said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. That beat the 36.7 billion yuan median estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  AIA Greenshoe Exercised  AIA Group Ltd. , the insurer sold by  American International
Group Inc.  in a Hong Kong initial public offering, said the
overallotment option was exercised in full, boosting the size of
the IPO to about $20.5 billion.  AIG, which had sold 7.03 billion shares in Hong Kong’s
biggest IPO on record, used the option to boost the sale by 1.05
billion shares, cutting its stake to 33 percent, according to a
statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange.  Alibaba Adds Sohu  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  said users of its search-engine
service may now access technology supplied by  Sohu.com Inc. , as
the two Chinese companies strengthen collaboration to challenge
industry leader  Baidu Inc.   Users of Alibaba’s Etao.com search service may now opt for
the Sogou software, in addition to Microsoft Corp.’s Bing
technology, Justine Chao, a spokeswoman at Alibaba, said by
phone.  Changan Production  Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. will double its 2012
production by 2020, the Chinese carmaker said.  Chongqing Changan aims to make 6 million cars in 2020, 30
percent of which will be new energy cars, chairman Xu Liuping
said at a press conference in Beijing. The 6 million goal would
double the company’s production target of 3 million in 2012,
according to Xu.  Chongqing Changan is also working with Ford Motor Co. on a
10-year development plan in China, Xu told reporters in Beijing,
without giving details.  Barnier Speaks  China needs to follow through on its commitment to help
rebalance the global economy, particularly in the context of
foreign-exchange policy, European Union Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said Oct. 29.  “If China wants to keep its rank at the table of the big
actors, which is its rightful place, they also have a
responsibility they must answer to,” Barnier said in a speech
at the Atlantic Council, a public policy group in Washington.  Lafite Sets Record  Three bottles of Chateau Lafite’s 1869 vintage each sold

Hong Kong Oct. 29, underlining Asia’s dominance of the auction

vintages that spanned 139 years -- were each estimated to sell
for between HK$40,000 and HK$60,000, said Sotheby’s.  THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY:  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.  (600019 CH): China’s biggest
