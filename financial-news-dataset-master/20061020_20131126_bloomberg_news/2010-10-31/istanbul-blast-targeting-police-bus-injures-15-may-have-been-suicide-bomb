A suicide bombing in central
Istanbul injured 15 police and 17 civilians, said the city’s
Governor  Huseyin Avni Mutlu . Five of the policemen were
“heavily injured,” he said.  The male bomber, who died in the attack, attempted to board
a police minibus in Taksim Square in the Turkish city at 10:40
a.m., said Mutlu at a press conference today. It wasn’t
immediately clear who was responsible for the blast, which he
described as “a crime against humanity.”  The attack was an attempt to “disturb peace, destroy the
stability and safety environment in Turkey, but this won’t be
tolerated,” NTV television reported Turkish Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan  as saying in the southern province of
Mardin.  Kurdish, leftist and Islamist groups have carried out
attacks in the city in the past. A country-wide cease-fire
imposed by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, was scheduled
to expire today. A senior commander of the group,  Murat Karayilan , apologized for killing civilians and said he wants to
extend the cease-fire indefinitely, Radikal newspaper reported
on Oct. 28.  Turkish security forces killed two members of the PKK after
they attacked a police station in the eastern city of Tunceli,
Milliyet newspaper reported on Oct. 25.  Turkey’s fight against the PKK, which seeks autonomy in the
country’s largely Kurdish southeast and is considered a
terrorist organization by the U.S. and European Union, has led
to the deaths of some 40,000 people since 1984, most of them
Kurdish civilians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
