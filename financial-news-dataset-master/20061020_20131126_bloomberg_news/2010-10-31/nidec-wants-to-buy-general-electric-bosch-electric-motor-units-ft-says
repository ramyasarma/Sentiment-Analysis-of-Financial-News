Nidec Corp.  wants to buy the electric
motor divisions of  General Electric Co.  and  Robert Bosch GmbH ,
the Financial Times reported, citing Chief Executive Officer
Shigenobu Nagamori.  Nagamori said Franz Fehrenbach, chief executive of Bosch,
rejected his proposal in 2008, the FT  said .  Nagamori said he didn’t reach a deal about buying GE’s
motor divisions after speaking to officials at the company
“five or six years ago,” the report said.  “In terms of candidates, they are ones we have
considered,” Norio Tamura, a spokesman for Kyoto-based Nidec,
said via telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
