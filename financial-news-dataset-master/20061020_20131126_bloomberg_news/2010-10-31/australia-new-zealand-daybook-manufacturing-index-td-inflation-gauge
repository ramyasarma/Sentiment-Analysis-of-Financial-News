An overview of activity since
markets closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES
New York: Most U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index completing its second straight monthly advance, as
Microsoft Corp. beat profit estimates and economic growth
matched forecasts.
*Microsoft rose 1.5 percent as corporate customers increased
purchases.
*The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,183.26 as of 4 p.m.
in New York.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.54 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 11,118.49.  London: European stocks were little changed, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index rallying for the first October in three years,
as Gestevision Telecinco SA received approval to acquire a rival,
offsetting a slump by Sandvik AB.
*The Stoxx 600 was little changed at 265.96 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London, falling 0.3 percent this week.  Tokyo: Japanese stocks fell, sending the Topix index to its
longest losing streak in more than three months, as a
strengthening yen added to concern about earnings
growth and some companies missed their profit estimates.
*The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.8 percent to 9,202.45 at
the close in Tokyo, the lowest close since Sept. 9.
*The broader Topix index dropped 0.4 percent to 810.91, with
about five stocks retreating every three that advanced.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.5
percent to 4,661.60 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney. The index has advanced 0.3 percent this week, extending
this month’s gain to 1.7 percent.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar fell to a 15-year low against the yen as
slowing inflation added to speculation the Federal Reserve will
have greater latitude to expand asset purchases next week to
support the economic recovery.
*The euro dropped against Japan’s currency as European Union
discussions on a permanent mechanism to deal with nations facing
default raised concern the region’s debt crisis may intensify
again.
*The U.S. currency decreased 0.8 percent to 80.40 yen at 5
p.m. in New York. It touched 80.39, the lowest level since April
1995 and just above the post-World War II low of 79.75 reached
that month.
*The dollar fell 0.1 percent to $1.3947 per euro.  TREASURIES  New York: U.S. 30-year bonds gained for a second day as a report
showing the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure rose
less than forecast added to speculation policy makers will boost
purchases of longer-term assets.
*The inflation gauge, a measure of personal consumption that
strips out food and energy costs, increased at a 0.8 percent
annual pace in the third quarter, less than the 1 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
*Yields on 30-year bonds tumbled six basis points, or 0.6
percentage point, to 3.99 percent at 4:56 p.m. in New York.
*Benchmark 10-year note yields fell six basis points for the
day and rose five basis points for the week to 2.6 percent.  COMMODITIES  GOLD  New York: Gold futures rose on speculation that the dollar will
resume its decline, boosting the appeal of the precious metal as
an alternative asset.
*Gold futures  for December delivery rose 70 cents to $1,339.60
an ounce at 12:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price dropped as much as 0.8 percent.  METALS  New York: Copper fell in New York, paring a fourth monthly gain,
as a stronger dollar eroded demand for industrial metals as an
alternative investment.
*Copper for delivery in December slid 5.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.7325 a pound at 12:12 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are up 2.2 percent this month.  GOLD  New York: Gold futures rose, capping a third straight monthly
gain, on speculation that the Federal Reserve will increase debt
purchases, weakening the dollar and boosting the metal’s appeal
as an alternative investment.
*Gold futures  for December delivery rose $15.10, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $1,357.60 at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The price is up 24 percent in 2010, heading for the 10th  OIL  New York: Crude oil fell as the dollar rose against the euro,
reducing the appeal of raw materials as an alternative
