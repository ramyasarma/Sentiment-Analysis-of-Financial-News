Ontario Power Generation Inc.,
which provides about 70 percent of the Canadian province’s
generating capacity, increased output at five gas-powered units,
and one hydro-electric plant and idled another site.  The power generator increased production at its Portlands
197-megawatt G1 and G2 units, as well as at its 245-megawatt G3
site, according to a  posting  on the Independent Electricity
System Operator’s  website .  It also brought back to service its 287-megawatt Thoroldcgs
plant, 450-megawatt Tasarina site, according to the posting.
Both plants are gas-powered. The company also increased power at
its 381-megawatt Desjoachims hydro plant.  Yesterday, it idled the 200-megawatt Haltonhillslt G1 and
Haltonhillsslt G2 and the 175-megawatt Haltonhillslt G3 units,
