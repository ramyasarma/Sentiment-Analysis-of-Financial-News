BHP Billiton Ltd.  may increase its
$39 billion bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. by 10
percent, the  Sunday Times reported , citing people it didn’t
identify.  The revised offer won’t be made until after a Nov. 8 court
case about Potash Corp.’s use of a so-called poison-pill defense
against the attempted takeover, according to the Times. Canada’s
government has indicated to BHP that it will approve the
acquisition over opposition from provincial authorities, the
newspaper said.  BHP declined to comment on the story, the company’s London-
based spokesman, Ruban Yogarajah, said when telephoned by
Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
