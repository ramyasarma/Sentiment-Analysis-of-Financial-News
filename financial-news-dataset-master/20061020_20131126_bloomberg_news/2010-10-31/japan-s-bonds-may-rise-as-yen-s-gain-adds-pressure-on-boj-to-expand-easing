Japanese bond futures rose on
speculation the nation’s central bank will announce further
easing measures this week to follow similar moves by the Federal
Reserve.  Demand for bonds increased before a report today that
economists said will show U.S. manufacturing grew at a slower
pace, adding to expectations the Fed will take action to shore
up the economy. The Japanese central bank is set to gather on
Nov. 4-5 after the Fed’s meeting on Nov. 2-3.  “The BOJ wants to show it’s doing its part to support the
economy and stave off political pressure,” said Takashi
Nishimura, an analyst in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s largest lender by assets.
“The U.S. economic recovery will probably take time, providing
a floor for bonds.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.04 to
143.24 as of 10:15 a.m. at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The yield on the 0.8 percent bond due September 2020 rose
half a basis point to 0.925 percent in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
price fell 0.044 yen to 98.869 yen. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The BOJ plans to discuss purchases of exchange-traded funds
and real-estate investment trusts at its meeting. The bank left
its benchmark interest rate and credit programs unchanged on
Oct. 28.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index in the
U.S. dropped to 54 in October from 54.4 in September, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before today’s data. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Japan’s Ministry of Finance will sell 2.2 trillion yen ($27
billion) of 10-year bonds tomorrow. The prior 10-year sale on
Oct. 7 drew bids worth 2.85 times the amount on offer, compared
with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.16 at the September
sale.  Primary dealers, which are required to bid at government
debt sales, often reduce holdings of bonds in case prices
decline before they can pass on the new securities to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
