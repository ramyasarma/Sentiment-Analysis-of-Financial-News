New Zealand’s currency is trading
near a 27-month high after the U.S. dollar fell to a 15-year low
against the yen in New York on speculation the Federal Reserve
will step up quantitative easing.  The New Zealand currency bought 76.57 U.S. cents at 7:46
a.m. in Wellington from 76.68 cents in late New York trading on
Oct. 29, the highest level since July 18, 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
