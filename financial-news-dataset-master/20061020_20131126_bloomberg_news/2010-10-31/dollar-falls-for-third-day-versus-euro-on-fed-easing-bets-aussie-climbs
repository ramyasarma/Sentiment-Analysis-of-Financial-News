The dollar and yen declined against
most of their major counterparts after a Chinese report showed
manufacturing accelerated in October, encouraging demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The Swiss franc slumped to its weakest level since August
against the euro as global stocks gained. The U.S. and Japanese
currencies also slid on speculation the Federal Reserve and Bank
of Japan will announce further measures this week to keep
borrowing costs low. Norway’s krone climbed against the dollar
after  manufacturing  increased for a second month.  “Risk is a bid given the good PMI data last night, but
people are hesitant to get too overextended going into
Wednesday, so that’s going to keep the dollar range-bound over
the next two days,” said  Brian Kim , a currency strategist at UBS
AG in Stamford, Connecticut.  The dollar traded at $1.3919 per euro, up 0.2 percent, at
8:52 a.m. in New York, compared with $1.3947 on Oct. 29, after
touching $1.4011, the weakest level since Oct. 25. The yen rose
0.2 percent to 111.86 per euro, from 112.12, after gaining 1.3
percent last week. The yen was at 80.39 per dollar, compared
with 80.40, after touching 80.22, the strongest level since
April 1995.  The greenback and yen remained lower after data showed U.S.
consumer spending rose less than forecast in September as
incomes dropped for the first time in more than a year.
Purchases increased 0.2 percent, the smallest gain in the third
quarter, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington.
Incomes fell 0.1 percent, the first drop since July 2009, and
the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation stagnated,
capping the smallest 12-month gain in nine years.  Stocks Gain  The  MSCI World Index  rose 0.1 percent after China’s
purchasing managers’ index increased to 54.7 last month from
53.8 in September. Another gauge of China’s manufacturing from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics jumped to 54.8 from 52.9.
Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.5 percent.  Fed policy makers are expected at the end of their Nov. 2-3
meeting to announce another round of government bond purchases
in a strategy called quantitative easing. Estimates for the
ultimate size of the Fed’s asset-buying program include $1
trillion by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and $2 trillion by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Purchases of $500 billion would add as
much stimulus as reducing the Fed’s benchmark rate by 0.50 to
0.75 percentage point, New York Fed President  William Dudley 
said in an Oct. 1 speech.  The yen declined 0.4 percent to 79.40 versus the Australian
dollar and slid 0.1 percent to 11.47 against the South African
rand as traders awaited the outcome of the Bank of Japan’s Nov.
4-5 meeting, which was originally scheduled for Nov. 15-16.  BOJ Timing  The BOJ’s “timing has more to do with the effects on the
market if the Federal Reserve decides to do a certain amount of
QE that is judged to be quite aggressive,”  Thio Chin Loo , a
senior currency strategist in Singapore at BNP Paribas SA, said
in a Bloomberg Television interview. “If the dollar does fall
back on this aggressive QE, then the BOJ may want to step into
the markets to stabilize the dollar-yen rate.”  Japan’s currency has appreciated more than 5 percent since
authorities acknowledged on Sept. 15 intervening for the first
time in six years to help the nation’s export-dependent economy
by selling the yen.  The Fed will release its policy decision on Nov. 3 at about
2:15 p.m. in Washington. About 18 hours later, at noon in London
(8 a.m. in New York and Washington), the Bank of England will
announce its move. The ECB will go public with its decision 45
minutes later, at 1:45 p.m. in Frankfurt (8:45 a.m. in New
York). The Bank of Japan concludes its talks on Nov. 5 at about
noon local time (11 p.m. in New York).  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the dollar against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners including the euro and yen, fell 0.3 percent to
77.075 after touching 76.773, the lowest level since Oct. 25.  The gauge of the greenback has dropped 4.3 percent since
Sept. 21, when the Fed said in a statement following its policy
meeting that it’s prepared “to provide additional accommodation
if needed” to support the economic recovery.  The yen tumbled more than 1 percent against the dollar in
less than two minutes in Tokyo trading before retracing much of
the drop. A Japanese government official declined to comment on
the yen’s movements when speaking to reporters in Tokyo on the
condition of anonymity.  The reversal of the moves signaled that it resulted either
from a mistake by a trader or a system error,  Kathleen Brooks ,
research director in London at Forex.com, a unit of the online
currency trading firm Gain Capital, wrote in a client note.  The Swiss franc tumbled as much as 0.7 percent to 1.3797
per euro, the weakest level since Aug. 11, and slid as much as
0.7 percent to 98.91 centimes versus the dollar.  The krone climbed for a third day against the dollar,
appreciating 0.2 percent to 5.8381.  Norwegian Manufacturing  A seasonally adjusted index based on responses from
Norwegian purchasing managers rose to 54.2 from a revised 53.1
in September, Fokus Bank said in a statement today. A reading
above 50 signals expansion. Norges Bank last week kept its main
interest rate unchanged at 2 percent.  Traders are losing confidence in the Group of 20 finance
officials’ pledge to avoid foreign-exchange manipulation about a
week after the leaders vowed to stop devaluing currencies to
prop up their economies.  Volatility among Group of Seven currencies rose to about
the highest level in four months since the G-20 meeting ended on
Oct. 23, according to the  JPMorgan G-7 Volatility Index . Euro-
dollar fluctuations jumped 30 percent since Sept. 20, a day
before the last Fed policy meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
