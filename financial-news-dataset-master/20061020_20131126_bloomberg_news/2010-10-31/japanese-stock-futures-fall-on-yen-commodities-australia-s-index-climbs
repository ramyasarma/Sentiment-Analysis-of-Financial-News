Japanese  stock   futures  fell as
companies reported slumping earnings, commodity prices dropped,
and the yen’s strengthening to a 15-year high against the dollar
cut the outlook for export earnings. Australian shares advanced.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. , a
Japanese carmaker that derives 35 percent of its sales in North
America, declined 1.2 percent from the last closing share price
in Tokyo as the yen climbed ahead of this week’s meetings by the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Those of Nomura Holdings
Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage, sank 2.8 percent after profit
plunged.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s largest mining company,
gained 0.5 percent in Sydney after the Sunday Times said the
company may boost its bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  “Pressure on the yen is strong because of speculation
about additional quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve,”
said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. “People want to know how Japan and the
U.S. will set their monetary policies.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
December closed at 9,170 in Chicago on Oct. 29, compared with
9,175 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,170 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.6 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed in Wellington.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.6
percent today. Almost seven stocks advanced for every five that
declined on U.S. exchanges on Oct. 29 as Microsoft Corp. beat
profit estimates and economic growth matched forecasts.  U.S. Economy  The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter as consumer spending climbed the most in almost
four years, the Commerce Department said on Oct. 29, a sign the
expansion is developing staying power. The increase matched the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and
followed a 1.7 percent gain the prior three months.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 7.4 percent in
2010, compared with gains of 6.1 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.8
percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 14 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen appreciated to 80.22 against the dollar today, the
strongest since April 1995. The Japanese currency traded at
80.68 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on Oct. 29. A
stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies when overseas
revenue is converted into their home currency.  The yen is on course for its strongest annual average level
since currencies began trading freely in 1971, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s closing price.  Commodities Decline  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum dropped 1.4
percent on Oct. 29. Crude oil for December delivery fell 0.9
percent to settle at $81.43 a barrel in New York.  About 170 companies of almost 1,000 in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index are scheduled to announce earnings this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 12 companies have
 exceeded profit estimates  for every 11 that have fallen short,
based on Bloomberg data compiled from about 360 companies that
have reported quarterly results since Oct. 7.  To contact the reporters for this story:
