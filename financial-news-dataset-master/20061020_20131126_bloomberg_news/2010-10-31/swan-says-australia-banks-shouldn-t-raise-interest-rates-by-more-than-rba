Australian banks wouldn’t be
justified in raising interest charges by a larger margin than a
possible increase in the official rate of the Reserve Bank of
Australia,” Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said.  “The RBA Board will meet on Tuesday to announce its rate
decision,” Swan wrote in his weekly economic note, e-mailed
today. “Last week, we again saw the major banks report very
healthy profits, so there’s no justification for any of the
banks to raise rates beyond official rates on Tuesday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
