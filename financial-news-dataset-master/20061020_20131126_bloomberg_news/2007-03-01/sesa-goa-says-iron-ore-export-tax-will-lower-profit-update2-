             Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) ,  India 's  biggest  non-state-run iron ore exporter, said the government's plan to levy
a tax on overseas sales of the steelmaking ingredient will lower
profit. Its  shares  slumped for a second day.  
 Net income in the year to March 31, 2008, will be reduced
by 1.8 billion rupees ($41 million), said Managing Director P.K.
Mukherjee in a phone interview. Sesa, 51 percent owned by Mitsui
& Co., may post a 6.98-billion rupee profit this year, according
to a median estimate of 7 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.  
 The tax may prompt companies vying for Mitsui's holding in
the miner to lower their bids, investor U.B. Bhat said. Arcelor
Mittal, the world's  biggest  steelmaker, and Essel Mining Ltd.,
controlled by India's  Aditya Birla Group , are among bidders for
the stake worth $760 million.  
 ``The pressure to pay a huge premium has lessened,'' said
Bhat, a  fund manager  at Canbank Mutual Fund in Mumbai. ``With
the government order and the market turning negative, all the
speculation about bidders paying 2,500 rupees will end.''  
 Shares of Sesa Goa slumped as much as 17 percent to 1,485
rupees, extending yesterday's 8.5 percent drop. They traded at
1,631 rupees at 3:12 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock reached a record
2,000 rupees Jan. 29 on speculation the buyer of Mitsui's stake
will offer to buy more at a higher rate than the market price.  
 Under Indian law, a company buying more than 20 percent of
another company must make a so-called open offer to acquire a
further 20 percent of its shares.  
 Earnings Outlook  
 The government will impose a tax of 300 rupees a metric ton
to curb overseas sales of the commodity amid rising demand from
local steelmakers, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said
yesterday in his annual budget speech.  
 The levy will cut Sesa's 2008 earnings to 161 rupees per
share, CLSA Asia Pacific Markets said in a note today. That's 24
percent below the brokerage's previous estimate. Thomson had
forecast per share earnings of 208.95 rupees before yesterday's
announcement.  
 Sesa Goa sells 58 percent of its 9-million ton output to
steelmakers in  China  and  Taiwan , and 11 percent to buyers in
 Japan . It posted a  net income  of 5.4 billion rupees in the year
ended March 31, 2006. Profit in the nine months ended Dec. 31
was 3.54 billion rupees, according to the company's  Web site .
