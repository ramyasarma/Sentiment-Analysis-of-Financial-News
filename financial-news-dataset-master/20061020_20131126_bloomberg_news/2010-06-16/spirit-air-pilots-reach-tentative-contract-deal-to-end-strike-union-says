             Spirit Airlines Inc. and its pilots
reached a tentative contract agreement that may end the first
strike at a U.S. passenger airline since 2005, the union for the
employees said.  
 Flight operations, which have been suspended since June 12,
will resume June 18, the carrier said on its  website.  The pilots
won’t return to work until contract language and some additional
details are resolved, Doug Baj, spokesman for the  Air Line
Pilots Association , said in an e-mail, without giving specifics.  
 Pilots at the closely held carrier walked off the job after
three years of negotiations failed to result in a contract.
Talks resumed yesterday, and the pending accord was reached
today.  
 “We expect to update you later today with further news
that will be positive,” Baj said.  
 Misty Pinson , a spokeswoman for Miramar, Florida-based
Spirit, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail or telephone
call seeking comment. The airline is owned by private equity
firms Indigo Partners LLC and Oaktree Capital Management LLC.  
 A strike by mechanics at Northwest Airlines Corp. in 2005
was the last major work stoppage at a U.S. passenger carrier
before the Spirit walkout.
