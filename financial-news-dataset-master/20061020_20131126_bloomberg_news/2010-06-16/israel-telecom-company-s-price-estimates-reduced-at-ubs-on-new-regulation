             Israeli telecommunication companies,
including  Cellcom Israel Ltd. , had their share-price estimates
lowered at UBS AG as the Ministry of Communications proposed
reforms to increase competition.  
 “Israeli telcos face tougher regulation,” Tel Aviv-based
analyst Darren Shaw wrote today in a research note. “The
regulator plans to launch a series of measures to shake up a
rather benign regulatory environment and disciplined market
structure.”  
 Cellcom, the country’s biggest mobile phone company,  was
downgraded to “neutral” from “buy” and its price estimate
lowered 30 percent to $26.  Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. 
and  Partner Communications Co.  had their price estimates reduced
15 percent to 10.2 shekels and 27 percent to 73 shekels,
respectively. UBS reiterated the “buy” recommendations on the
companies.  
 The ministry proposed cutting mobile termination rates, the
charges that operators make to connect calls to each others’
networks, by 84 percent last month. The changes may come into
effect August 1. The ministry said in January it plans to allow
mobile virtual network operators, which offer wireless services
using the network of an existing telecommunications company, to
enter the market. In addition, it proposed to ease the entry of
new operators to the market.
