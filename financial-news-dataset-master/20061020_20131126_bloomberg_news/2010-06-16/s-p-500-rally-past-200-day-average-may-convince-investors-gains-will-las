             The advance in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  that sent the gauge above its  average level  in the
last 200 days yesterday may spur more gains as investors become
convinced the rally will last.  
 Signs the U.S. economy is expanding pushed the benchmark
index for American  equities  up 2.4 percent to 1,115.23
yesterday, erasing its loss for the year and exceeding by 6.5
points the level monitored by investors who base trading
decisions on chart patterns. The S&P 500 rose near the 200-day
mean on June 3 and May 27 before declining as much as 5 percent
in the next two days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Closing above technical levels can lure buyers who seek to
benefit from price momentum, said  Michael Nasto , the senior
trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which manages about $2.5
billion in San Antonio. More investors may be drawn in should
the  S&P 500  climb 2.5 percent to surpass its 50-day moving
average of 1,143.  
 “That we moved through this technical level might give us
a little bit of a  pop  in the coming days,” Nasto said. “It’s a
very important inflection point in the absence of any really
major economic or geopolitical news. A lot more people than
usual are looking at this.”  
 FedEx Earnings  
 The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent to 1,110.67 as of 9:38 a.m.
today as a lower-than-estimated earnings forecast at  FedEx Corp. 
and a drop in housing starts cast doubt on the economic
recovery. The 200-day moving average is about 1,109.  
 Equities increased yesterday as an 11th straight month of
growth in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s manufacturing
gauge added to evidence the economic rebound is weathering the
European debt crisis. The S&P 500 has jumped 6.2 percent since
June 7 as concern over European budget deficits eased and
investors speculated growth in China and the U.S. will bolster
the global recovery.  
 The  S&P 500  closed below the 200-day average on May 20 for
the first time since July 2009 and had remained under the trend
line for 16 straight sessions. Its failure to hold above 1,105,
the intraday high the day before May’s employment report spurred
a 3.4 percent plunge, was cited in the index’s June 14  drop  that
erased a 1.3 percent rally.  
 Chart Fixation  
 Technical levels are affecting markets in the absence of
earnings and economic news and take on more influence as traders
fixate on them, said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $13.3
billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.  
 “No one disregards technical  analysis  now,” said
Sorrentino. “If they do so, they do so at their own peril.
Technical analysis has become increasingly important because of
so much money chasing around. The momentum of money has become
more important than the fundamentals beneath it.”  
 Over longer periods, earnings and valuations will determine
the price of stocks, not chart patterns, said  Peter Boockvar ,
equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York.  
 “It doesn’t tell me anything,” Boockvar said. “It means
nothing about where we’re going from here, just how far we’ve
come. I look at technical analysis but I don’t use it for my
trading decisions. Breaks above the 200-day moving average can
be false  breakouts  -- you can’t look at it in a vacuum.”  
 Analysts project profits for companies in the 2010 will
rise  17 percent  this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
benchmark index fell 8.2 percent in May, its biggest monthly
retreat since February 2009. The index trades for 13.7 times
forecast profits in 2010, compared with an average of 16.4 since
1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Crossing the 200-day average “doesn’t tell you that this
correction is over but I think people would look at it as a
plus,” said  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management, which oversees $770 million and whose flagship fund
beat 97 percent of peers over the last year. “It would set up
the test of the next resistance, which most people would say is
at the 50-day moving average. I would call it a minor victory.”
