             Builders broke ground on fewer U.S.
homes in May than anticipated after the expiration of a
government incentive boosted construction and sales in preceding
months.  
 Housing  starts  fell 10 percent to a 593,000 annual rate last
month, the lowest level this year, from a revised 659,000 pace in
April that was less than previously estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. Building  permits ,
a sign of future construction, unexpectedly declined to a one-
year low. Single-family home starts suffered the biggest drop
since 1991.  
 Builders  focused less on starting new projects and more on
completing houses for those seeking to qualify for the tax
credit, which required contracts be signed by April 30 and closed
by the end of this month. Growth in  sales  and construction will
now depend more on job gains and a drop in foreclosures, which
have pushed down prices and created competition for builders.  
 “With the tax credit expiring and sales slowing down,
builders will ease up on starts,” Michael Moran, chief economist
at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc. in New York, said before
the report. “I see the housing market staying neutral for a
time, moving sideways rather than being a source of growth.”  
 Economists forecast starts would fall to a 648,000 annual
rate, according to the median of 78 projections in a Bloomberg
News survey. Estimates ranged from 575,000 to 698,000.  
 Building permits were projected to rise to 625,000,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  
 Starts were up 7.8 percent from the same month last year,
while permits increased 4.4 percent.  
 Construction of single-family houses slumped 17 percent, the
biggest drop since January 1991, to a 468,000 pace in May.
Permits declined 9.9 percent after a 10 percent drop in April.
Work on multifamily homes, such as townhouses and apartment
buildings, jumped 33 percent to an annual rate of 125,000.  
 South and Northeast  
 Two of four regions had a decrease in starts last month, led
by a 21 percent slump in the South and a 6.3 percent decline in
the Northeast. Single-family starts were down in all regions.  
 Under the government’s incentive program, which was renewed
and expanded in November, buyers had to sign contracts by the end
of April and close on homes by June 30 to qualify for a credit
worth as much as $8,000. Banks usually require homes to be
livable before they agree to a closing.  
 Senator Harry Reid last week proposed a three-month
extension to the closing deadline amid concern that a rush of
buyers created too big a backlog for builders to complete
projects by the end of this month. An extension would support
housing starts and construction in coming months.  
 Sales in April  
 Helped by the credit, sales of new homes surged in April to
a 504,000 rate, the highest level in two years, according to
Commerce Department data. The increase brought the number of
homes on the market down to 211,000, the fewest since 1968.  
 Even so, home sales and construction will be more dependent
in coming month on the labor market. While employment has
increased for six of the last seven months, job gains in May were
less than forecast and the unemployment rate remains near a 26-
year high.  
 A report yesterday showed builders became more  pessimistic 
this month. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
Housing Market Index fell to 17, from 22 in May. Readings below
50 signal more builders view the market as poor.  
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., the largest homebuilder in New
Jersey, earlier this month reported that it closed on 1,197 homes
with an average price of $287,050, compared with 1,459 homes for
an average $277,053 a year earlier. Orders for new homes fell 17
percent and contract signings in May were slower.  
 Pulled Sales Forward  
 “Our slower pace of May net contracts seems to confirm that
the tax credit helped pull some sales forward into earlier months
this year,” Ara K. Hovnanian, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “We recognize that the
expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit, the lack of job
growth and a potential increase in foreclosures all pose risks to
a housing industry recovery.”  
 Some builders are optimistic. Toll Brothers Inc., the
largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, said May 26 it increased its
land holdings for the first time in four years in anticipation of
a recovery in the market. The number of houses under contract but
not yet sold rose in the three months ended April 30 compared
with a year earlier for the first time since 2006, the Horsham,
Pennsylvania-based company said.  
 “People are not as scared any longer that a house is a
lousy investment,” Chairman Robert Toll said on a conference
call.
