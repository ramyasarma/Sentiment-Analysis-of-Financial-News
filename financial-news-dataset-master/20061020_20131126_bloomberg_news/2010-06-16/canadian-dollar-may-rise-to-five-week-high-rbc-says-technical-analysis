             Canada’s dollar may appreciate to a
five-week high versus its U.S. counterpart after it broke past a
support level of C$1.0378 as renewed risk appetite boosted the
currency, according to Royal Bank of Canada.  
 “The key here is the importance of risk aversion and the
importance of equity markets,” said  George Davis , chief
technical analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a telephone
interview. “That is what has been driving the price action.”  
 The loonie closed beyond C$1.0378 on June 10 for the first
time in almost a month and has finished stronger than that level
every day since then. The level was along a trend line drawn
from highs reached in April, when the currency traded on a one-
for-one basis with its U.S. counterpart.  
 Improved sentiment may push the Canadian dollar to
C$1.0111, a level last reached on May 13, Davis said. The loonie
may encounter support if it depreciates to C$1.0428 or C$1.0543,
he said. RBC’s target is C$1.0175 in one to two months.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  moved above its 200-day
average yesterday and erased its loss for the year. The
Canadian dollar is 89 percent correlated to the U.S. stock
index, according to 30-day Bloomberg data. A correlation of 100
percent would mean they move in lockstep.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast price changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support is a level where
orders to buy a currency are clustered.
