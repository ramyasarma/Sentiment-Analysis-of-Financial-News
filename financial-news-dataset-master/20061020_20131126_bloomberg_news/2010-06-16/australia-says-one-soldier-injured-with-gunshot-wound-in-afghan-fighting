             An Australian soldier has been
injured in southern Afghanistan during a five-day operation that
killed insurgents, the military said.  
 The Australian soldier received a gunshot wound in the arm
while an Afghan National Security Force officer was struck on
the side during an operation that also involved U.S. forces,
Major General John Cantwell said in an e-mailed statement
without saying when the incident occurred.  
 “Through the Shah Wali Kot offensive, the combined
coalition force has severely disrupted an important insurgent
stronghold,” Cantwell said. “They inflicted substantial losses
on a determined and heavily armed enemy force.”  
 Australia  has about 1,550 soldiers in Afghanistan, with
most based in Uruzgan, as part of Operation Slipper, the
military’s contribution to operations by the NATO-led
International Security Assistance Force.  
 Two Australian soldiers, Jacob Moerland and Darren Smith,
died last week in Australia’s first day of multiple fatalities
since the Vietnam War.
