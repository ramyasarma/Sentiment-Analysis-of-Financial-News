             A congressional leader of Brazil’s
Democrats party said opposition presidential candidate Jose
Serra will select a running mate from outside his own party.  
 Paulo Bornhausen, head of the party in the lower house,
said that Serra would select a running mate approved by the
Democrats and refrain from naming someone from his own Brazilian
Social Democracy Party, or PSDB.  
 “All we’re doing is reaffirming what was agreed to 11
months ago,’’ Bornhausen said in a telephone interview.
‘‘There’s no room for a pure-blooded’’ PSDB ticket.  
 Serra, 68, was nominated by the PSDB on June 12. According
to an Ibope poll published June 5 he is in a statistical tie
ahead of October elections with Dilma Rousseff, the chosen
successor of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
