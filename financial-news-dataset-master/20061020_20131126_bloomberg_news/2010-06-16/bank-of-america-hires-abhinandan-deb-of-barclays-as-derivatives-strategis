             Bank of America Corp. hired
 Abhinandan Deb  of Barclays Plc as an analyst for equity-linked
securities in its London office.  
 Deb, 30, was a London-based equity derivatives strategist
at Barclays, the U.K.’s fourth-largest lender, until earlier
this year. He started at Bank of America last week,  according to 
information filed with the U.K. Financial Services Authority.  
 “As long as the markets remain turbulent and a large
percent of company profits come from trading including
derivatives, demand for these positions will remain strong,”
said  Richard Lipstein , a managing director at Boyden Global
Executive Search Ltd. in New York. “Volatility hasn’t gone
away.”  
 Deb and  Rinat Rond , a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment.
