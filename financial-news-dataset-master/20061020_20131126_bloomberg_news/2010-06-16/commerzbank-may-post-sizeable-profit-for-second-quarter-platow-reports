             Commerzbank AG  will probably post a
“sizeable” profit in the second quarter though the earnings
are unlikely to match the level of the first three months,
Platow Brief reported, without saying where it got the
information or providing an estimate.  
 The Frankfurt lender plans to make a full interest payment
on capital provided by the German bank-rescue fund this year,
according to the newsletter.
