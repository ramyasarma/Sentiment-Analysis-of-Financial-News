             Quadra FNX Mining Ltd.  said it
failed to reach agreement with  State Grid Corp. of China , the
country’s largest electrical-system operator, to form a joint
venture to develop copper assets in Chile.  
 A memorandum of understanding between the companies to help
finance the Sierra Gorda project expired June 15, Vancouver-
based Quadra said today in a statement. State Grid had agreed in
March to form a venture that would control Sierra Gorda and
Quadra’s Franke mine in Chile. A plan for State Grid to buy
shares representing a 9.9 percent stake in Quadra will also be
unwound, Quadra said.  
 “We intend to remain on our previously stated development
timeline,” Quadra Chief Executive Officer  Paul Blythe  said in
the statement. The company has the financial resources to
continue the project, he said.  
 State Grid wasn’t willing to put up enough money to advance
development of the $2 billion Sierra Gorda mine before the
issuance of project permits, Quadra said.  
 “The risk to funding the Sierra Gorda project has
increased,”  Greg Barnes , a Toronto-based analyst at TD
Securities, said today in a note to clients. While Barnes said
his analysis suggests Quadra could fund the project from its own
cash flow, “this would not be a prudent strategy given the size
of the project.”  
 Quadra fell 10 cents to C$12.48 at 4:10 p.m. in Toronto
Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  have declined 14 percent this
year.
