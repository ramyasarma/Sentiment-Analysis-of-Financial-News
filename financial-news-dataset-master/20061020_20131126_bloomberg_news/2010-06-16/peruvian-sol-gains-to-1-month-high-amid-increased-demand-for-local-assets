             Peru’s sol rose to a one-month high
as faster-than-forecast growth in April boosted demand for the
nation’s local assets.  
 The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.8370 per U.S. dollar at 4:16
p.m. New York time, from 2.8385 yesterday. That’s its strongest
level since May 14.  
 South America’s sixth-largest economy expanded at the
fastest pace in 19 months in April as rising company and
household spending boosted construction, manufacturing and
retail output, the national statistics agency said yesterday.
GDP grew 9.3 percent from a year earlier, beating the 8.8
percent median estimate of nine economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 “Peru is in a sweet spot,” said  Hugo Perea , chief
economist at BBVA Banco Continental in Lima. “It is viewed
externally as a well-managed country from a macroeconomic point
of view, and given Peru’s strong fundamentals the sol should
continue its strengthening trend.”  
 Banco Central de Reserva del Peru didn’t intervene in the
foreign-exchange market today, it said on its website. The
central bank last bought dollars on April 15 to ease gains in
the local currency.  
 The yield on Peru’s benchmark 8.6 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.9 percent, according to Citigroup Inc.’s local unit.
