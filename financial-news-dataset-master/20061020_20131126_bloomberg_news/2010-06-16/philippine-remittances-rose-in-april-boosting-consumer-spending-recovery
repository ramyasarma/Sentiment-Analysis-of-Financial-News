             Remittances  sent home by Philippine
citizens abroad rose in April, boosting consumer spending and
supporting the economic recovery.  
 Money  sent back to the Philippines increased 5.4 percent
from a year earlier to $1.52 billion, the central bank said in a
statement in Manila today. The funds grew 5.6 percent in March.  
 Work opportunities for Filipino sailors, nurses and
engineers are growing as the global economy recovers from last
year’s slump. Remittances, which amount to more than a 10th of
the Philippines’ $167 billion economy, are helping sustain
domestic demand for Ayala Land Inc. homes and  Banco de Oro
Unibank Inc.  loans.  
 “Deployment is still strong and that gives us some comfort
for the outlook in remittances,”  Luz Lorenzo , an economist at
ATR-KimEng Securities Inc. in Manila, said before the report.
“If remittances managed to grow during last year which was the
worst of times, then we should do better this year.”  
 Remittances may increase 9 percent this year from 5.6
percent in 2009, Lorenzo forecast.
