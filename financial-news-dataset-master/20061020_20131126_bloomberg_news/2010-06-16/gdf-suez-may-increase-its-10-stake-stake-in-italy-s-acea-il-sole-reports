             GDF Suez SA may increase its 10
percent stake in Acea SpA, Il Sole 24 Ore reported, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Suez may reach an agreement with Francesco Gaetano
Galtagirone, who yesterday increased his holding in the Rome
municipal utility to 13 percent, to have a bigger role in the
management of the company, the Italian daily said.
