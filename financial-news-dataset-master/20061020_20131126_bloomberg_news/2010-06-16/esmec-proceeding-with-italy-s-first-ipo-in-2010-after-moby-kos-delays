             Tesmec SpA,  a maker of machines used
to build and maintain power lines and pipes, is proceeding with
Italy’s first initial public offering this year after volatility
prompted two of the country’s companies to postpone sales.  
 “The opportunities which arise from being listed are much
more than the risk of standing still,” Chairman  Ambrogio Caccia Dominioni  said today at a press conference in Milan. “We are
seeing a good response from investors. We need a stable
shareholder structure.”  
 Tesmec, based in Milan, will raise as much as 53.2 million
euros ($64 million) in the sale that allows its owners to cut
their stakes, which will allow the company to raise funds to
expand and cut debt as the owners cut their stakes. Existing
shareholders will receive almost 70 percent of the funds raised
in the sale, which values the company at as much as 107 million
euros.  
 Moby SpA and KOS SpA said this week they’ll delay their
listings as market swings deter investors from buying new
stocks. Intesa Sanpaolo SpA Chief Executive Officer Corrado
Passera said last week that market fluctuations may affect the
timing of the IPO of its Banca Fideuram SpA unit.  
 Mediobanca SpA  is managing Tesmec’s IPO. The bank is
offering 53.2 million shares at 70 cents to 1 euro apiece. The
shares are on sale through June 25. The Italian company will be
listed July 1 in Milan.
