             Gold may advance in New York on
concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will escalate,
spurring demand for the precious metal to protect wealth.  
 The euro slipped as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar.
Debt levels in Spain and Portugal may “snowball” in coming
years and more budget cuts are needed to meet deficit targets,
according to a draft European Commission document obtained by
Bloomberg News and dated May 26. Gold futures added 0.8 percent
yesterday, the most in a week, and are today trading within 1.5
percent of a record.  
 “The biggest reason to buy gold is credit and sovereign
risk and also just diversification out of currency exposure,”
said  Walter de Wet , an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London.
“Liquidity continues to increase and will help support gold’s
trend higher.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August added $1.70, or 0.1
percent, to $1,236.10 an ounce at 8:09 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Gold for immediate delivery in London gained 63 cents, or
0.1 percent, to $1,234.78.  
 The metal rose to $1,235.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,225 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 “There’s good physical buying interest whenever gold goes
back toward $1,220,” de Wet said. “We’ve seen increased
selling, especially out of Asia, on the approach to $1,250.”  
 Since 1920  
 Futures reached a record $1,254.50 an ounce on June 8 amid
speculation that debt-cutting measures by European nations will
slow growth. The metal rose 13 percent this year, heading for a
10th straight annual increase, the longest run since at least
1920, while the euro has dropped 14 percent against the dollar.  
 Spain, the International Monetary Fund and the European
Commission dismissed claims published in newspaper El Economista
that the country is set to receive a 250 billion-euro ($307
billion) credit line, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said.  
 “There are increasing concerns that Europe’s debt problem
may be prolonged,” said  Chris Yoo , manager of the global
derivatives team at Samsung Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Gold will
remain supported in the long term because it is preferred as a
safe-haven asset.”  
 Holdings in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, were unchanged for a third day at
a record 1,306.14 metric tons yesterday, according to the
company’s website. Global  holdings  of the metal by ETFs
increased 1.78 tons to an all-time high 2,041.7 tons yesterday,
according to Bloomberg data tracking 10 providers.  
 Silver, Palladium  
 Silver for July delivery in New York was 0.2 percent lower
at $18.545 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery lost 0.2 percent
to $1,574.90 an ounce. Palladium for September delivery declined
0.6 percent to $472.50 an ounce.  
 Palladium consumption by automakers will rise 18 percent
this year and total demand will increase 9 percent to 8 million
ounces, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said in a report
yesterday. Platinum auto demand will gain 9 percent this year,
with total consumption rising 4 percent to 6.9 million ounces,
it said. Both metals are used in pollution-control equipment for
vehicles as well as jewelry.
