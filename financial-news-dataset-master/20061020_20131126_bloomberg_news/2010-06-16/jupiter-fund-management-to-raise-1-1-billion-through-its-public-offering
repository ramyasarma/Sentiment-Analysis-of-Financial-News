             Jupiter Fund Management Plc , the
money manager run by  Edward Bonham Carter , jumped 15 percent in
London trading after raising 220 million pounds ($325 million)
in an initial public offering.  
 Jupiter surged 25 pence to 190 pence, giving the company a
market value of about 870 million pounds. The London-based firm
sold 133.5 million new shares at 165 pence apiece, it said in a
statement today. Jupiter’s owners sold 20.3 million shares for
33.5 million pounds.  
 The money manager pressed ahead with the offering after at
least 33 companies from London-based Ferrous Resources Ltd. to
Chinese wind-turbine maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. shelved IPOs due to stock market volatility
spurred by the European debt crisis. Jupiter had narrowed its
offering range to 160 pence to 170 pence, from 150 pence to 210
pence previously.  
 The sale price of 165 pence values Jupiter at about 11.2
times its estimated earnings for 2010, according to Execution
Nobel Ltd. analysts  Nitin Arora  and Sri Karthik Velamakanni.
That’s cheaper than Henderson Group Plc’s ratio of 13.3 and
Schroders Plc’s valuation at 16 times estimated earnings, while
Gartmore Group Ltd. has a ratio of 7.9, the analysts said.  
 JPMorgan Cazenove and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch
unit were managing the sale, along with Numis Corp. JPMorgan
Cazenove will be able to sell another 13 million shares in the
overallotment option within 30 days, according to the statement.
