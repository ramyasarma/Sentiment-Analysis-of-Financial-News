             India will buy back 100 billion
rupees ($2.15 billion) of government securities through an
auction on June 18 to boost cash in the financial system.  
 The government will buy the bonds through a multiple price-
based “multi-security” auction, The Reserve Bank of India said
in an e-mailed statement in Mumbai. The auction announcement was
made after the government agreed to buy back as much as 200
billion rupees in one or more tranches, it said.  
 The government will repurchase the 12.25 percent notes
maturing in 2010, 11.3 percent securities due 2010 and 6.57
percent debt maturing 2011, it said in the statement.  
 Overnight interbank  rates  climbed to as much as 5.40
percent today from 4.9 percent at the end of May. Banks borrowed
an average 375 billion rupees a day from the central bank
through its repurchase-auction window this month, indicating a
shortage of cash after license-fee payments by phone companies.
Last month, they lent a daily average of 328 billion rupees of
surplus cash to the central bank.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped
seven basis points to 7.59 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  
 The Reserve Bank, whose next policy meeting is scheduled on
July 27, has raised interest rates twice since mid-March, by a
quarter-percentage point each time. The  reverse-repurchase  rate,
or the rate at which the central bank absorbs surplus cash, is
3.75 percent, while the repurchase auction rate is 5.25 percent.
