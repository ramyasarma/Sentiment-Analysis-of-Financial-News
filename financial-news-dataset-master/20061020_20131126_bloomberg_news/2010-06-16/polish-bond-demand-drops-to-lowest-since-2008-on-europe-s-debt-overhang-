             Poland attracted the lowest demand
for 10-year bonds since 2008 and yields jumped at a government
auction today as Europe’s debt crisis damped demand for longer-
dated securities.  
 The Finance Ministry sold 2.43 billion zloty ($729 million)
of 5 1/4 percent bonds due in October 2020, less than the
maximum 3 billion zloty it planned to issue, it said in an e-
mailed statement. Investors bid for 2.97 billion zloty of bonds,
the lowest demand for 10-year bonds since July 9, 2008, before
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September that
year, according to data on the ministry  website . The average
yield rose to 5.791 percent from 5.586 percent at the previous
auction on April 14.  
 Yields on 10-year zloty bonds have increased as much as
0.32 percentage points in the past two months on concern
Europe’s debt crisis may stall the global recovery. Moody’s
Investors Service on June 14 cut Greece’s credit rating to junk.
Hungary roiled world markets this month after local politicians
compared the country’s finances to those of Greece.  
 “There is fear,” said  Olaf Pietrzak , a fixed-income fund
manager at Skarbiec Investment Management in Warsaw, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $1.5 billion in assets. “With such a
tremendous risk overhang, people prefer not to buy longer-dated
bonds unless they have to.” He predicts the 10-year bonds will
trade at yields of between 5.70 percent and 6.05 percent through
the end of August.  
 Even with the low demand, the auction pushed June sales to
more than the government’s target, making it a record month for
domestic bond issues,  Piotr Marczak , head of the ministry’s
public debt department, said by phone from Warsaw.  
 June Sales  
 PKO Bank Polski SA had predicted the yield at today’s
auction would rise to 5.8 percent and Societe Generale SA
projected the yield at 5.79 percent to 5.81 percent. The yield
at the April 14 sales was the lowest level in three years for
10-year bonds.  
 Bond prices fell today pushing the yield on debt maturing
in 2020 by 2 basis points lower to 5.83 percent as of 4:10 p.m.
in Warsaw. The premium that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year government bonds over German bunds rose to a euro-era
record today.  
 The “market uncertainty” related to debt situation in
Europe and “large supply” of debt and shares from the
government this month have made local investors “more
reluctant” to buy bonds at today’s auction, Marczak said.  
 ‘In Line With Market’  
 “In the current environment I don’t see anything
extraordinary in that,” he said. “The prices at the auction
were in line with market, the amount sold was decent and only
the demand turned out lower than expected.”  
 The Polish government plans to raise at least $1.2 billion
from selling shares of power producer Tauron Polska Energia SA.
Book building, in which potential investors say how many shares
they’re willing to buy and at what price, started on June 4 and
will last until June 21, according to the initial public
offering prospectus.  
 Today’s auction brings total government debt sales this
month to 10.86 billion zloty, more than the ministry’s 10
billion zloty June goal, the most of any month this year. Poland
sold 5.4 billion zloty of two-year debt on June 2 and 3.03
billion zloty of four-year road bonds on June 9.  
 The government covered 51 percent of 2010 borrowing needs
through the end of May, the Finance Ministry said on May 31.
