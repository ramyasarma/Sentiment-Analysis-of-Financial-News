             Flooding in France’s southwestern
Var region has left 10 dead and 200,000 homes without
electricity, French daily Le Parisien reported on its Website.  
 The newspaper cited the power-distribution unit of
Electricite de France SA for the power cuts, and didn’t say
where it got the information on fatalities. Four people are
still missing, according to the newspaper.
