             Robusta coffee rose for an eighth
session in London to the highest price since March last year on
speculation that investment funds may be buying because of
smaller stockpiles of the arabica variety in New York.  
 Coffee futures climbed to a 27-month high yesterday in New
York on concern about availability. Until yesterday, arabica
traded on ICE Futures U.S. in New York had gained 20 percent in
a week. Since the rally began, robusta had advanced 18 percent
until yesterday’s close.  
 “Arabica coffee isn’t being delivered” and the market is
tight in New York,  Eldred Buck , managing director of Eiger
Trading Advisors Ltd. in London, said by phone. A lot of
investors and funds have been buying to close bets that prices
would drop, he said.  
 Robusta for September delivery  climbed as much as $25, or
1.6 percent, to $1,595 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange, the
highest price since March 2009. It was trading at $1,571 at 1:40
p.m. in London. The eight-day rally is the longest winning
streak since July. Milder arabica coffee for September delivery
gave up gains of as much as 1.9 percent to trade 0.9 percent
lower at $1.5855 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  
 “The low quality nature of the current Brazilian coffee
crop harvest is not going to be able to alleviate the extreme
scarcity of high quality mild washed arabica,” Shawn Hackett,
president of commodities research and trading company  Hackett
Financial Advisors Inc . in Boynton Beach, Florida, wrote in a
note.  
 Short-Covering  
 There has been short-covering by funds in New York,  Angus Kerr , owner of coffee trading company Coffee ag in Cobham,
England, said by phone, referring to purchases of commodities to
close bets that prices would fall.  
 “Last Thursday, what started as spread-trading and short-
covering in London, amidst lower than certified exchange stocks
for the July expiry, quickly led to a rush in additional short
covering as well as attracting some fresh fund buying,”  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote
in a report e-mailed today.  
 While certified stocks on Liffe have been falling for much
of 2010 and have been a factor at the heart of the rally in
robusta futures, stockpiles in origin and consumer countries are
much more ample, she wrote.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.6 percent to 15.86
cents a pound and was trading at 15.88 cents at 8:54 a.m. in New
York. White, or refined, sugar for August delivery advanced as
much as 1.4 percent to $535.30 a ton and was last trading at
$528.50 a ton on the Liffe exchange.  
 In New York, cocoa for September delivery rose $5, or 0.2
percent, to $2,974 a ton. Cocoa for July delivery fell 14
pounds, or 0.6 percent, to 2,450 pounds ($3,623) a ton on Liffe.
