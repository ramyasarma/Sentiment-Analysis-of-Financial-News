             Soybeans climbed on speculation that
higher oil prices may boost demand for the crop as a source of
biofuel. Wheat, little changed, may also gain on concern that
rains may reduce production in the U.S. and Canada.  
 The most-active contract for the oilseed on the Chicago
Board of Trade rose as much as 0.6 percent, while corn, used to
make ethanol, matched yesterday’s one-month high. Oil gained to
more than $77 a barrel in New York after a report on U.S.
manufacturing boosted optimism that the recovery remains intact.  
 “It’s not strange for corn and soybeans to get support
from higher oil prices,” said  Toshimitsu Kawanabe , an analyst
at Tokyo-based commodity broker Central Shoji Co. Still, the
gain in the two crops may be limited as favorable weather has
improved U.S. crop conditions, he said.  
 Soybeans for November delivery gained as much as 5.25 cents
to $9.2075 a bushel, and last traded at $9.2025. The price
reached $9.2625 yesterday, the highest level for a most-active
contract since June 8.  
 Corn for December delivery climbed as much as 1 cent to
$3.76 a bushel, and traded at $3.7575 at 1:52 p.m. Singapore
time. Futures dropped 9.4 percent this year, in part on
forecasts for higher U.S. output.  
 Soybeans were partly supported by a jump in canola prices
in Canada,  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, wrote in a daily note today. Canada is the
largest exporter of canola, also known as rapeseed, followed by
Ukraine, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  
 Canola Gains  
 Canola for November delivery added 0.8 percent to C$421
($410.21) a ton on the ICE Futures Canada exchange today after
earlier touching C$421.70, the highest level since Dec. 16.
That’s the eighth gain, the longest winning streak since Jan. 6.  
 The gains in canola were the result of weather concerns in
Canada and confirmation that China will continue to accept
Canadian canola in 2010 under existing conditions, Mathews said.  
 Wheat for September delivery rose 2.25 cents to $4.6975 a
bushel in Chicago. The price touched $4.7175 yesterday, the
highest level since May 28.  
 “Further rain is expected in the saturated Canadian
Prairies, which will limit spring-wheat production, and the
winter-wheat harvest in the U.S. southern plains will slow
because of rain,” Mathews said.  
 Heavy Rainfall  
 Oklahoma’s winter-wheat crop, the nation’s second-largest
behind Kansas, has been damaged by heavy rain, the Oklahoma
Wheat Commission said in an e-mail. Twelve inches (30
centimeters) of rain have fallen in some areas of the state,
toppling wheat plants, the group said.  
 About 38 percent of the Oklahoma crop was collected as of
June 13, up from 12 percent a week earlier, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said in a report on June 14. Farmers who have yet
to harvest their grain may not get back into fields this week,
the commission said.  
 Australia, the world’s fourth-largest wheat exporter, kept
its forecast for the next harvest little changed, according to a
government agency. Output may be 22.1 million metric tons in
2010-11, compared with a March estimate of 21.94 million tons,
the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
said today. The previous harvest was 21.66 million tons.  
 Australia’s canola harvest may reach 2 million tons, the
bureau said, raising its outlook from a March estimate of 1.6
million tons. Output last year was 1.9 million tons, according
to the agency.
