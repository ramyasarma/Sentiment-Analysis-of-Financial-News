             Ethiopia ’s Federal High Court
sentenced a former top regional official to death for killing
three people and organizing a separatist group in the western
Benishangul Gumuz region, the state news agency reported.  
 Jemua Ruphael Amen was the former chief of the planning and
economic bureau in Benishangul Gumuz’s regional government, the
 Ethiopian News Agency  reported yesterday. He received military
training in Eritrea and formed the separatist Benishangul Gumuz
Liberation Movement, it said, citing a statement from the
Ministry of Justice.  
 Three other members of the group were sentenced to 10 years
in prison, the news agency said.  
 Relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea have been tense
since the two countries fought a 1998-2000 border war. Ethiopia
accuses Eritrea of backing ethnic separatist rebel movements in
the country’s eastern Somali region and southern Oromiya region.
