             Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi said that the economy is recovering and there needs
to be optimism in order to ensure that it continues.  
 “We began the year well, better than Germany and France,”
Berlusconi said today during a speech in Rome to the country’s
biggest retailers’ lobby. “The recovery is under way and it’s
psychological. People need to have confidence.”
