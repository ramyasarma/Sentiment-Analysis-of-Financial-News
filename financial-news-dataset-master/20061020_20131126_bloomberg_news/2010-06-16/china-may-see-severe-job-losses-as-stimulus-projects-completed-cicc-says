             China may see “severe” employment
losses next year as millions of temporary jobs end with the
completion of projects under the government’s 4 trillion yuan
($585 billion) stimulus package, according to China
International Capital Corp.  
 Recent pay  increases  in manufacturing industries and
widespread minimum-wage rises may also prompt more cautious
hiring practices by employers,  Ha Jiming  and  Xing Ziqiang  wrote
in a report to clients yesterday.  
 Research from the National Development and Reform
Commission estimates that the stimulus brought 5.6 million new
long-term jobs and nearly 50 million temporary positions during
the construction of the projects, economists at the Beijing-
based investment bank said.  
 The supply of labor into the market next year could
increase by 39 million, made up of 7.58 million college
graduates, 6 million to 7 million surplus laborers moving from
rural areas, and 25 million temporary  workers  who will lose
their stimulus-related jobs, according to the CICC report.  
 Assuming China’s  economic growth  slows to 7.5 percent in
2011, there may only be about 8 million new jobs created,
leading to a 31 million increase in the number of unemployed,
the economists wrote.
