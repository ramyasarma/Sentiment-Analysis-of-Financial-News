             Jan-Erik Frogg , head of the hedge-
fund advisory business at Union Bancaire Privée, is leaving the
Geneva-based money manager, according to two people who were
briefed on the departure.  
 Frogg was head of alternative investments at UBP until last
year. He joined the firm from Agora Capital Management Ltd. in
Geneva in 2004 and before that worked at Goldman Sachs in
London.  
 UBP spokesman  Jerome Koechlin  declined to comment. Frogg
couldn’t be reached for comment.  
 UBP last year hired  Richard Wohanka  as head of asset
management and alternative investments, and  Ian Cramb  as chief
operating officer, two of a series of appointments aimed at
stemming a 45 percent drop in assets in the two years through
2009. UBP is restructuring after losing $700 million for clients
through investments tied to  Bernard Madoff , convicted a year ago
of running the world’s largest Ponzi scheme.  
 Other new hires were aimed at separating UBP’s asset
management from risk functions, concentrating its hedge fund
business in New York, from London and Geneva.  
 The firm is among at least eight Geneva-based firms that
disclosed Madoff-related losses, undermining confidence in the
fund-of-hedge-funds model that the city’s bankers helped pioneer
in the 1960s.
