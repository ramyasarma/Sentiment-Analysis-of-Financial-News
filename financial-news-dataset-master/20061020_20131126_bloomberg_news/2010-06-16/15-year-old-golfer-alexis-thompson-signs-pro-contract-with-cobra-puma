             Alexis Thompson , 15, became the
youngest female golfer to turn professional, signing an
endorsement agreement today with Cobra-Puma Golf.  
 Thompson will compete in her first professional event this
weekend at the  Shoprite LPGA Classic  in Galloway, New Jersey.  
 She will use Cobra equipment and wear Puma apparel, the
company said.  Puma AG , Europe’s second-largest sporting-goods
maker, acquired Cobra from Fortune Brands Inc.’s Titleist in
March.  
 Thompson’s decision to enter pro golf comes after she went
undefeated in the U.S. Curtis Cup victory last week over a team
from Great Britain and Ireland. Thompson posted four wins and
one tie in the matches.  
 Three years ago, at age 12, the native of Coral Springs,
Florida, became the youngest player to qualify for the U.S.
Women’s Open. Her brother Nick, 27, competes on the U.S PGA
Tour.  
 While on tour, Thompson will continue her education through
home schooling by her parents and other teachers, according to
Atlanta-based sports agency Blue Giraffe Sports, which will
represent her.  
 Thompson will turn 16 in February.  Michelle Wie , now 20,
turned pro a week before her 16th birthday in October 2005.
