             J Sainsbury Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest supermarket owner, reported first-quarter sales growth
that met analysts’ estimates as it added online customers and
sold more non-food products such as DVDs.  
 Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.1 percent,
excluding fuel and including value-added tax, London-based
Sainsbury said today. That “puts us at the front of the pack,”
Chief Executive Officer  Justin King  said, adding that online
sales reached a record 120,000 orders in one week. The median
estimate of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for growth of
1 percent, compared with the prior quarter’s 1.7 percent.  
 Sainsbury is opening as many as 100 convenience stores this
year and expanding non-food products such as its TU clothing
range to fuel growth in the slowing U.K. market. The retailer
raised its market share to 16.3 percent in the three months
through May 16 as sales climbed ahead of the market, under
pressure from “low inflation,” Kantar Worldpanel said.  
 “It’s a fairly solid start to the year,” said  James Monro , an analyst at Standard & Poor’s equity research, with a
“hold” rating on Sainsbury. “The U.K. is still a very
competitive and promotional market and we don’t expect inflation
to come back until the end of the year.”  
 Sainsbury  shares  gained 2.4 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 326.8
pence at 10:23 a.m. in London. The stock has risen 1 percent
this year.  
 Inflation  
 CEO King said he expects “low-to-no-growth supported by
low-to-no-inflation” in the next quarter or two, adding that
Sainsbury has seen some deflation in fresh-food products.  
 Same-store sales growth in the 12 weeks ended June 12 was
the lowest in six years as low inflation, political uncertainty
and high fuel prices weighed on consumer spending, the CEO said.  
 “We don’t see there being any inflationary pressure and we
see no reason why consumers will suddenly become more
positive,” King said.  
 Larger competitor Tesco Plc yesterday said it expects a
“steady consumer recovery” in its domestic market as inflation
increases and consumer confidence improves.  
 “Through the year, we would expect sales trends to
improve,” RBS analyst  Justin Scarborough  said before today’s
release. He has a “buy”  rating  on Sainsbury stock.  
 King said the U.K. government must give retailers plenty of
notice if it plans to increase value-added tax, and urged
ministers to avoid such a move around business periods such as
Christmas. “It’s a costly, complex thing to do,” he said.
