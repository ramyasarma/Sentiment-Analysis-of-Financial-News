             Nuclear power stations may produce
almost a quarter of the world’s electricity by 2050 as
governments and utilities favor atomic power over fossil fuels
to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  
 “Nuclear energy is one of the key low-carbon energy
technologies that can contribute, alongside energy efficiency,
renewable energies and carbon capture and storage, to the
decarbonization of electricity supply by 2050,” the
International Energy Agency’s executive director  Nobuo Tanaka 
said today at the East Asia Climate Forum in Seoul, according to
a statement e-mailed by the Paris-based organization.  
 The latest reactor designs build on more than 50 years of
technology development and no major breakthroughs are needed to
achieve an expansion of nuclear power, IEA said in its Nuclear
Energy Technology Roadmap, a report published together with the
 Nuclear Energy Agency .
