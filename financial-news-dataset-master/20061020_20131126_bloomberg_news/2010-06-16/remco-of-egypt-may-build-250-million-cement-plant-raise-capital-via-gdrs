Construction, the third-biggest publicly traded resorts company
in Egypt, may build a $250 million cement plant and increase its
capital by issuing global depositary receipts.  
 “We’re currently studying two available licenses for the
cement plant in South Sinai and Wadi El Gadeed,” Ayoub Adly
Ayoub, the president of Remco, said in an interview yesterday in
his office in Cairo. “There are also eight new ones that we
will study. The plant would have a capacity of 1.5 million
tons.”  
 Remco may also issue global depositary receipts through a
capital increase, he said.
