             Robert F.X. Sillerman , the former
chief executive officer of  CKX Inc. , is seeking to increase his
stock holdings in the owner of “American Idol” through private
purchases or a public tender offer.  
 Sillerman, the largest  investor  in CKX with 21 percent of
the stock, is in discussions with a private financing source to
make such an offer, according to a  regulatory filing  today. He
stepped down as chairman and CEO May 7 to pursue a possible
takeover of the company.  
 Sillerman’s potential share purchase is a “superior
alternative” to the company’s sale to anyone else at current
prices or a premium, the filing states. CKX received a $600
million bid last month from an investor group led by Simon
Fuller, a person familiar with the offer said at the time.
Fuller is the founder of 19 Entertainment and creator of the
“Idol” TV series.  
 The founder of CKX, Sillerman said his possible offer would
enable shareholders to benefit from future opportunities and
avoid potential payment of a break-up fee, according to the
filing. He’s seeking a majority of the outstanding shares and
has notified CKX’s board of directors. There’s no assurance he
will make any purchases or an offer, according to the filing.  
 Ed Tagliaferri , a spokesman for CKX, declined to comment.  
 CKX, which also owns the rights to Elvis Presley’s name and
image,  fell  7 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $5.23 today in Nasdaq
Stock Market  trading  before the filing was released, giving the
company a market value of about $486.7 million. The shares are
trading below Fuller’s $6.45 a share takeover offer.
