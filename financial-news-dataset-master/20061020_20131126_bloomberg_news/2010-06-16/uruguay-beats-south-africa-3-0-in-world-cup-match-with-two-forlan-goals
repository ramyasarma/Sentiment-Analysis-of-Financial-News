             Diego Forlan scored twice as Uruguay
beat South Africa 3-0 to move atop Group A at soccer’s World Cup
today, leaving the host nation without a win through two games.
Alvaro Pereira added a third goal in injury time.  
 Forlan got the opener in the 24th minute in Pretoria, with
the second goal on 80 minutes from a penalty kick after South
Africa goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune received a red card for
tripping Luis Suarez.  
 Uruguay has four points from two games, with South Africa,
France and Mexico all on one point. France and Mexico meet in
their second game tomorrow.  
 South Africa, the first African nation to host the World
Cup, has never been past the group stage of the competition. It
is the first time a host has failed to win either of its opening
two matches.  
 Uruguay, champion in 1930 and 1950, is now unbeaten in
three matches against South Africa.
