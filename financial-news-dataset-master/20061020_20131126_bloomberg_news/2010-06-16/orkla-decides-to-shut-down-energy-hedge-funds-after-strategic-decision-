             Orkla Finans AS, in the industry’s
latest retreat, made a “strategic decision” to close its 85
million-euro ($105 million)  Energy Fund  and  Carbon Fund .  
 Orkla’s energy fund, which traded commodities including
Nordic and German electricity, natural gas and emission permits,
lost 12 percent this year through April. The specialist carbon
fund gained 3.1 percent, according to data on Bloomberg.  
 “The closures have nothing to do with bad performance.
It’s a strategic decision,” Yngve Torvanger Jordal, head of
hedge fund products at Oslo-based Orkla Finans, said today in a
telephone interview. While the termination date hasn’t been
decided, investors will get their capital this month, he said.  
 The closures are the latest in the European hedge fund
business, where at least three funds were shuttered last month,
citing sliding returns and investor redemptions.  
 The Orkla Energy Fund had as much as 185 million euros in
assets under management in July 2009. About 40 million euros of
current assets reflect internal investment by Orkla.
