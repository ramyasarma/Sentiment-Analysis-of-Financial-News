             Union Pacific Corp. , which
transports Asian auto imports, expects an “elongated” economic
recovery, Chief Executive Officer  Jim Young  said.  
 “We’ve still got a ways to go,” he said yesterday in an
interview at Bloomberg’s New York office. “It’ll be a positive
slope in terms of recovery, but I think it’s going to be very
much elongated compared with anything we’ve seen before.”  
 U.S. railroads’ cargo volume has increased during the past
year, after plummeting beginning in 2008’s fourth quarter. The
rebound is an indicator of the wider rebound, Young said.  
 “We’re a darn good barometer of the economy,” said Young,
whose Omaha, Nebraska-based company has the largest locomotive
fleet among U.S. railroads.  
 Union Pacific’s shipments that move by a combination of
rail, truck and ship, which include consumer goods such as
furniture, have risen 24 percent this year, according to the
Association of American Railroads. That’s the most among the
four largest U.S. railroads.  
 The company’s volume of other goods has climbed
9.3 percent, including a 67 percent increase in automotive
shipments, which account for 6 percent of  sales .  
 Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp., which competes with
Union Pacific in the western half of the U.S., had increases of
0.6 percent for rail-truck-ship cargo and 5.3 percent for other
shipments. Burlington Northern is owned by  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  
 Young, 57, credited his company’s efforts to improve
service for outpacing Burlington Northern in shipment gains. He
has been chief executive since January 2006.  
 Share Performance  
 Union Pacific gained $2.41 or 3.3 percent, to $75.15 at
4:15 p.m. yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The  shares  have risen 18 percent this year, the most
among the three companies in the  Standard & Poor’s rail index .  
 The rail index has advanced 16 percent, while the S&P 500
has increased less than 1 percent.  
 Young said that his company will use its cash for capital
spending and that he’s not considering any acquisitions. Union
Pacific raised its quarterly  dividend  22 percent in May.  
 “When I think about investment, what you want to do with
 cash , for us it’s putting a lot of the dollars back into the
business,” he said.  
 The company remains cautious about spending, Young said.
Union Pacific still has about 3,300 laid-off  employees , down
from a peak of about 5,300, he said.  
 Credit Concern  
 Young said he doesn’t expect Union Pacific to be directly
affected by the European economic crisis. He said his biggest
concern is that it may tighten credit access for the railroad’s
smaller customers.  
 “The credit availability to that mid-to-small customer has
been a challenge for a long time,” Young said.  
 UBS Securities analyst Rick Paterson estimated in a June 10
report that about 10 percent to 15 percent of Union Pacific’s
business is affected by overseas markets, primarily because of
agriculture shipments. Paterson, who is based in New York,  rates 
the company’s shares “neutral.”
