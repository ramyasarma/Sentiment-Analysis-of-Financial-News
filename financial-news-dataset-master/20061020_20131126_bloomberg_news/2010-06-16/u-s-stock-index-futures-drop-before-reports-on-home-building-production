             U.S. stock-index futures dropped,
indicating the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  will retreat from a
four-week high, before reports on home construction and
industrial production.  
 International Game Technology, a maker of computerized
casino gaming systems, declined 2 percent in German trading
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised clients to sell the
shares. Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. fell 1.3 percent after the
world’s largest soft-drink bottler updated shareholders on its
earnings forecast.  
 Futures  on the  S&P 500  expiring in September lost 0.4
percent to 1,104.8 as of 7:16 a.m. in New York.  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  futures declined 0.3 percent to 10,299 and
Nasdaq-100 Index futures retreated 0.3 percent to 1,886.75.  
 Some investors “remain cynical as to the sustainability of
the economic improvement as the stimulus programs wear off and
spending cuts begin to take their toll,” said  Jonathan Jackson ,
the head of equities at Killik & Co. in London.  
 The S&P 500 rallied 2.4 percent yesterday to 1,115.23, the
highest close since May 18. The advance sent the index about 6.5
points above its average level in the past 200 days, a move
considered significant by investors who base trading decisions
on chart patterns.  
 Debt Crisis  
 The gauge tumbled 14 percent from a 19-month high on April
23 through June 7 as concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis will
derail the economic recovery and BP Plc’s leaking well in the
Gulf of Mexico triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
The S&P 500 has since rebounded 6.2 percent as concern over
European budget deficits eased and investors speculated growth
in China and the U.S. will bolster the global recovery.  
 Industrial production probably increased in May by the most
in four months, showing U.S. manufacturers are overcoming the
fallout from the European debt crisis, economists said before a
Federal Reserve report due at 9:15 a.m. in Washington.  
 Output at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.9 percent
in May, the biggest gain since January and the 10th increase in
the past 11 months, according to the median estimate of 82
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Other reports may show
wholesale prices and home construction declined last month.  
 International Game declined 2 percent to $19.20 in German
trading. Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on the shares to
“sell” from “neutral.”  
 Coca-Cola Enterprises  retreated 1.3 percent to $26.16 in
Germany. The company said it sees full-year earnings per share
increasing 10 to 12 percent in 2010, on a comparable and
currency-neutral basis. The company had seen 2010 comparable
earnings per share up 10 percent excluding currency swings.  
 Genoptix Inc. fell 3.6 percent to $22.06 in pre-market New
York trading. The company said it expects a second-quarter
profit of about 30 cents a share. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of 40 cents a share.
