             The Italian government’s proposals
to reduce incentives for renewable energy production may cost
banks about 5 billion euros ($6 billion),  Il Sole 24 Ore 
reported, citing an interview with  Guido Rosa , chairman of the
foreign bank Italian association.  
 The government’s proposed measure in its deficit-reduction
package would jeopardize bank financing for solar-heating
projects, Rosa told the newspaper.
