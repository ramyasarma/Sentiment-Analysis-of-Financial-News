             The  Pacific-10 Conference  asked the
 University of Utah  to become its 12th member, the latest move in
a whirlwind two weeks of college sports realignment.  
 The Salt Lake City-based school would be the second to join
the conference, following the University of Colorado’s decision
to leave the Big 12 on June 10.  
 the University of Nebraska left the Big 12 for the Big Ten
Conference and Boise State University in Idaho left the Western
Athletic Conference for the Mountain West Conference, where Utah
currently plays.  
 Utah will hold a press conference tomorrow at 3 p.m. New
York time to discuss the invitation, the conference said in a
press release.
