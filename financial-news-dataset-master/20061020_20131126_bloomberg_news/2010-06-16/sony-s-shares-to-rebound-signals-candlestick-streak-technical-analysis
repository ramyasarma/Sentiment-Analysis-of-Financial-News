             Sony Corp.  is set to rebound in
Tokyo stock trading following a streak of 10 weekly declines,
according to an analysis of the electronics maker’s share price
on a so-called candlestick chart by Ichiyoshi Securities Co.  
 The 10-week drop on a candlestick graph showing the price
changes from the start to the end of the week is the longest
series of weekly falls since a 10-week stretch ending in
December 1991, according to Ichiyoshi. It exceeds an eight-week
streak beginning in September 2008, when the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. led to a rout in stock markets.  
 Shares of the Tokyo-based company climbed as much as 9.7
percent during the month after the 1991 losing streak. Some
analysts who make trading decisions based on weekly candlestick
charts consider 11 declines as the maximum, said  Yukihiro Takahashi , general manager of Tokyo-based Ichiyoshi.  
 “The rebound is getting closer,” Takahashi said in an
interview.
