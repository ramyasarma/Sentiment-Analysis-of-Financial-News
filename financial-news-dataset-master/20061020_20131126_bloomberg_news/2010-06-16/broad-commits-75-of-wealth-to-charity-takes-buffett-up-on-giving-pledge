             Eli Broad  and his wife, Edythe, have
pledged 75 percent of their wealth to charity, the Los Angeles
billionaire and philanthropist said in a statement today.  
 The Broads are part of a drive called “The Giving
Pledge,” started by  Warren Buffett  and Bill and  Melinda Gates 
to encourage rich Americans to give at least 50 percent of their 
wealth to charitable causes.  
 “Philanthropy is much harder than running two Fortune 500
companies,” said Broad, 77, former chairman of SunAmerica Inc.
and KB Home, in an e-mailed statement today. “We will pledge in
writing to give away 75 percent of our wealth during and/or
after our lifetime.”  
 The Broad Foundations have invested more than $2 billion
in education, scientific and medical research and the arts.
Their largest commitment has been $600 million to establish the
Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Harvard University, according to the statement.  
 Buffett, the world’s third-richest person and chairman of
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , has pledged more than 99 percent of his
wealth to philanthropy. The greatest part of his fortune,
estimated in March at $47 billion by Forbes magazine, is being
given in annual installments to the foundation established by
Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda
Gates.
