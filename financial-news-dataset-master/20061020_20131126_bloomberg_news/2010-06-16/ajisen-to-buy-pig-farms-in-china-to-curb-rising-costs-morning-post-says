             Ajisen China Holdings Ltd.  plans to
buy pig farms in China to curb rising costs and ensure a stable
supply of key ingredients, the South China Morning Post said,
citing Chief Executive  Daisy Poon Wai .  
 Ajisen wants to buy the farms as volatile pork prices and
consumer inflation “challenged” its profit margin, Poon was
cited as saying.  
 The company, which operates 400 Japanese-style ramen
restaurants in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, consumed 2,300 tons
of pork and pork ribs last year, the newspaper reported.  
 Still, Ajisen’s gross profit margin climbed 1.9 percentage
points to 69.7 percent last year, the Post said. That compares
with about 60 percent for Chinese restaurants and about 62
percent for foreign fast food chains in China, it said.
