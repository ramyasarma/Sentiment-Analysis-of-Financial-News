             The Democratic Party of Japan will
seek a bipartisan overhaul the tax code and may consider a
higher consumption tax, Nikkei English News said, without saying
where it got the information.  
 The ruling party last year vowed to keep the tax level for
four years, the term of the lower house; the platform this year
before the upper-house vote omits that time frame, Nikkei said.
