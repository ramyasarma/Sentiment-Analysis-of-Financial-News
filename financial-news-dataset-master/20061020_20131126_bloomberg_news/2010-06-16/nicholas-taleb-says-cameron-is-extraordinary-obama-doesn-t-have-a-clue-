             Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of
“The Black Swan,” said British Prime Minister  David Cameron  is
“the only thing we have left” to build a more robust economy,
in an interview with the  New Statesman  magazine.  
 Taleb, whose book is about how unforeseen events can roil
markets, said that Cameron is “extraordinary” and
“understands expert problems,” according to a transcript
released by the London-based magazine. By contrast, “ Barack Obama  doesn’t have a clue.”  
 After Taleb met Cameron for an hour in London, he told the
New Statesman, “I went to Washington, and the discourse had
nothing to do with the real problem. And I thought, ‘He’s the
only thing we have left.’”  
 Cameron’s government yesterday announced the formation of a
panel to examine the future structure and regulation of banking,
including the question of whether to split up retail and
investment banks. Taleb praised his moves to cut the deficit.  
 “You have to take some pain to remove the tumor,” he
said. “It’s unethical for members of society today to spend
their great-grandchildren’s money. Lower the level of debt,
encourage equity, and you definancialize the economy.”
