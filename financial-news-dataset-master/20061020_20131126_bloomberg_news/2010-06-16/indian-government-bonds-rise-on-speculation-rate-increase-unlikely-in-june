             India’s 10-year  bonds  rose the most
in four weeks on speculation the  central bank  will refrain from
raising interest rates this month as money-market rates climb.  
 Overnight interbank rates  climbed to as much as 5.40
percent today from 4.9 percent at the end of May. Banks borrowed
an average 375 billion rupees a day ($8.1 billion) from the
central bank through its  repurchase-auction  window this month,
indicating a shortage of cash after license-fee payments by
phone companies. Last month, they lent a daily average of 328
billion rupees of surplus cash to the RBI.  
 “We are not convinced that there will be an inter-meeting
hike, given the recent significant tightening of liquidity
conditions,” Nomura Holdings Inc. economists  Sonal Varma  and
Ketaki Sharma wrote in a June 15 research note.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 dropped
seven basis points to 7.59 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price rose 0.46, or 46 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to
101.44.  
 The Reserve Bank of India, whose next policy meeting is
scheduled on July 27, has raised interest rates twice since mid-
March, by a quarter-percentage point each time. The  reverse-
repurchase auction rate,  or the rate at which the central bank
absorbs surplus cash, is 3.75 percent, while the repurchase
auction rate is 5.25 percent.  
 The benchmark wholesale-price index advanced 10.16 percent
in May from a year earlier, after a 9.59 percent gain in the
previous month, the commerce ministry said on June 14.  
 The central bank should increase interest rates soon,
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh’s  top economic adviser said, after
inflation unexpectedly accelerated last month.  
 “I think early action is called for on the part of
monetary authorities,”  Chakravarthy Rangarajan , chairman of the
Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, said in an interview
in New Delhi today. “It is a good procedure to follow, to raise
rates in small steps.”
