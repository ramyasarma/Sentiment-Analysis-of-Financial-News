             Amani Toomer  has Hall of Famer  Lynn Swann ’s achievements in his sights, even after retiring from
football.  
 Toomer, the former New York Giants wide receiver, on Nov. 7
will try to become the first National Football League player to
run the  New York City Marathon  since Swann covered the 26.2-mile
(42.2-kilometer) distance in 1993, according to the New York
Road Runners, which organizes the race.  
 Swann, the three-time Pro Bowl wide receiver who was
inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001, ran the
marathon as a 41-year-old in 4 hours, 26 minutes, 21 seconds.  
 “We definitely know that that is the mark that has been
set,” Toomer said in a telephone interview. “Hopefully, we’ll
be able to beat that.”  
 Toomer, 35, is running on behalf of closely held watchmaker
Timex Group BV, which has sponsorship agreements with the Giants
and the New York City Marathon.  
 Toomer played  13 seasons  for the Giants, catching 668
passes for 9,497 yards and 54 touchdowns. He led the team with
six catches and 84 yards in the 2008 Super Bowl as New York
upset the New England Patriots 17-14.  
 After spending the 2009 training camp with the Kansas City
Chiefs, Toomer was released on Sept. 1 and said he struggled to
stay fit during his first season out of football.  
 “For six months there, I was doing just what most guys do,
just kind of blowing up, getting out of shape,” Toomer said.
“I missed training.”  
 Heart Rate  
 To prepare for the marathon, he’s been supplied with a
personal trainer and  Timex’s latest watch technology , which
includes a heart-rate monitor and GPS tracking device. Toomer
has never run a marathon.  
 Timex has agreed to donate $1 to NYRR youth programs for
every person Toomer beats in the race. Someone finishing with
Swann’s exact time a year ago would have placed 24,522nd out of
the record field of 43,741, meaning he would have beaten 19,219
runners.  
 Toomer, who grew up in California, lives in the New York
area and said that he is planning to stay there as he tries to
build a career in broadcasting.  
 “You never know, maybe I’ll run a couple more marathons;
maybe I’ll get an Ironman triathlon in,” he said. “Hopefully
I’ll get into better shape than when I was playing.”
