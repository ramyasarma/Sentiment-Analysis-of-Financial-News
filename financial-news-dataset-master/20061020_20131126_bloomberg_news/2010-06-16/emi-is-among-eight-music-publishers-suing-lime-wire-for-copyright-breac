             EMI Music Group Publishing  and
Universal Music Publishing Group are among eight music
publishers that sued file-sharing website Lime Wire LLC for
copyright infringement on a “massive scale.”  
 The suit was filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court,
where a similar infringement case is pending against Lime Wire.
In that case, members of the Recording Industry Association of
America are seeking an order permanently shutting down the
company and damages for copyright infringement. A trial is
scheduled for January.  
 “The songs that make their illegal venture lucrative don’t
appear out of thin air,” the publishers said in a statement.
“Behind every song is a vast network of people -- a songwriter,
a publisher, a performer, a record label. They have robbed every
individual in that chain.”  
 Like the RIAA lawsuit, the music publishers are seeking
damages and an order barring Lime Wire from infringing their
works.  
 “We have had many promising meetings with labels,
publishers, songwriters and artists alike about our new music
service and a business model that will compensate the entire
industry,” Lime Wire said yesterday in a statement.
“Publishers are absolutely a part of that solution, and we’re
hopeful that this action will serve as a catalyst to help us get
to there.”  
 The case is EMI April Music Inc. v. Lime Wire, 10-cv-04695,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
