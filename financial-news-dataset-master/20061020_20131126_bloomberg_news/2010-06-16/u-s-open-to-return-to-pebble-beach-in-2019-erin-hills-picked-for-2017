             The  U.S. Open  will return to  Pebble
Beach Golf Links  in 2019, the 100th anniversary of the oceanside
California course and the sixth time the championship will be
staged at the public venue.  
 The  U.S. Golf Association  announced the plan as it prepares
for tomorrow’s start of the 110th U.S. Open, golf’s second-
oldest championship. Pebble Beach also will host the 2018 U.S.
Men’s Amateur Championship and is a potential site for a future
U.S. Women’s Open, Tom O’Toole, chairman of the USGA’s
championship committee, said in a news conference.  
 Pebble Beach has been the site of 11 national
championships, from the 1929 U.S. Amateur to this year’s U.S.
Open. Hosting the 2018 and 2019 tournaments will mark the second
time the course has been the site of the men’s Amateur and men’s
Open championships in consecutive years. The U.S. Amateur was
staged at the course in 1999, followed by the 2000 U.S. Open.  
 The USGA also announced today that  Erin Hills , a public
course built on 652 acres among the glacial dunes of Wisconsin’s
Kettle Moraine region, will host the 2017 U.S. Open. The course,
located about 35 miles northwest of Milwaukee and opened in
2006, hosted the 2008 U.S. Women’s Amateur Public Links
Championship and will be the site of the 2011 U.S. Amateur
Championship.  
 While Wisconsin has hosted 11 USGA national championships,
this will be the first U.S. Open played in the state.  
 The site of the 2018 U.S. Open has yet to be decided.
