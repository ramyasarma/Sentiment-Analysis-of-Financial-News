             Pakistan’s central bank will sell 90
billion rupees ($1.05 billion) of treasury bills in an auction
today at yields higher than in the previous sale, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  
 The State Bank of Pakistan will offer benchmark six-month
treasury bills at 12.29 percent, according to the median
forecast of seven money market dealers and two economists. It
sold similar-maturity notes at 12.24 percent in the previous
auction on June 2.  
 The monetary authority will sell three-month paper at 12.07
percent, compared with 12.01 percent at the previous auction,
and one-year notes at 12.39 percent, compared with 12.34
percent.  
 The central bank plans to  raise  460 billion rupees from
treasury bills in the quarter that ends June 30, according to
its website. The State Bank of Pakistan kept its discount rate,
or the benchmark interest rate, unchanged at 12.5 percent last
month after  inflation  accelerated to a three-month high of 13.26
percent in April. It cut the discount rate three times last year
by a cumulative 2.5 percentage points.  
 Treasury-bill auctions, held every two weeks, are an
indication of the central bank’s stance on lending to commercial
banks. The central bank will unveil the results of the sale
after 2 p.m. local time. Pakistan raised 87.3 billion rupees at
the previous auction.
