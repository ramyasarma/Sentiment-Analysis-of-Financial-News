             The Brazil Mid-Cap Exchange Traded
Fund will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June
22, said the chief executive officer of Global X Management
Company LLC, the asset manager overseeing the fund.  
 The ETF, which includes  Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s
biggest cosmetics maker, and  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA
Empreendimentos e Participacoes , the country’s largest
homebuilder, will trade under the ticker BRAZ. The ETF, which
tracks the  Solactive Brazil Mid Cap Index , is the first to
invest exclusively in companies with market values of $2 billion
to $10 billion,  Bruno del Ama , the CEO of New York-based Global
X, said in a phone interview from Madrid.  
 “What you want when you invest in Brazil is to participate
in the economy’s development and the country’s growth,”  del Ama 
said. “We’re going to give investors access to local, well-
established, less risky companies.”  
 Latin America’s largest economy grew 9 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the fastest annual rate since 1995.  
 The $9.6 billion  iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund  is the
biggest ETF tracking the nation’s stocks, with Petroleo
Brasileiro SA and Vale SA accounting for 36 percent of the fund.
The  Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF  consists of smaller
Brazilian companies. Exchange-traded funds issue a fixed number
of shares and trade throughout the day like stocks. Most are
designed to passively track a benchmark equity index.
