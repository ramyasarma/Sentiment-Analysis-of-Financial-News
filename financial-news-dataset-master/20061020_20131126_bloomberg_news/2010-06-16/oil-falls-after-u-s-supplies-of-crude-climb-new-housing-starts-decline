             Oil fell after a government report
showed U.S. supplies of crude increased last week amid a drop in
refinery operations and on concerns over the strength of the
recovery as new housing starts declined.  
 Crude oil for July delivery dropped as much as 46 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $77.21 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $77.27 at 6:16 a.m.
Singapore time. The contract yesterday rose 73 cents, or 1
percent, to $77.67 a barrel, the highest settlement price since
May 5. Futures are up 8.8 percent from a year ago.
