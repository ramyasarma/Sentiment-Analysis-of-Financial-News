             The euro may extend its decline to a
level last reached in 2003 on Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis,
according to  Sophia Drossos , co-head of global currency strategy
at Morgan Stanley.  
 The shared currency will fall as much as 9 percent to $1.12
as the market forces the 16 member nations to rein in spending
on programs such as welfare and retirement benefits, Drossos
said in a radio interview today with  Tom Keene  on “Bloomberg
Surveillance.”  
 “There are structural problems in Europe that aren’t going
away any time soon,” said Drossos. “The euro still has further
to decline.”  
 The euro fell today from a two-week high against the
greenback after the European Union, the International Monetary
Fund and the U.S. Treasury denied a report in the newspaper El
Economista that they are putting together a credit line of as
much as 250 billion euros ($307 billion) for Spain. The Iberian
nation’s government also dismissed the claim.  
 The drop in the euro may slow in a year or two when
investors turn their attention to America’s budget deficit,
Drossos said. While the market is forcing euro members to
address structural issues now, the U.S.’s balance sheet will
come under focus when its growth momentum wanes, she said.  
 “At some point, at some price, investors will say a lot of
the bad news with regard to the euro is in the price,” said
Drossos, based in New York. “Then they’ll start to focus on the
other side of the equation. The fiscal issues that we do face
here are going to prevent the U.S. dollar from getting even
stronger against the euro.”  
 Deficit Cuts  
 Reductions in budget deficits will put Europe on a path to
growth in three to five years with improved productivity and
efficiency, Drossos said. So far, no one has made the “tough
decisions” on the budget in the U.S., she said.  
 The euro slid 0.2 percent to $1.2312, from $1.2332
yesterday, after rising to $1.2353, the highest since June 1.  
 The French government’s announcement today that it will
raise the retirement age and increase taxes is a preemptive move
to “get out ahead” of issues roiling debt markets, according
to Drossos.  
 The retirement age in France will rise to 62 by 2018 from
60, Labor Minister  Eric Woerth  said today. The government will
increase taxes on stock options, dividends and capital gains,
and will raise the top income-tax rate by a percentage point to
41 percent.
