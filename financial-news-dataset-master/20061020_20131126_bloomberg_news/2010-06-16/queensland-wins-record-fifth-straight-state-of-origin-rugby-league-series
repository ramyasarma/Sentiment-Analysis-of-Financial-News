             Queensland beat New South Wales 34-6
to secure an unprecedented fifth straight series victory in
Australian rugby league’s State of Origin.  
 Israel Folau touched down twice as the Maroons ran in six
tries at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium before the Blues got their
first try in the final minute to avoid a record loss.  
 Queensland’s run of victories in the annual interstate
series began in 2006, with the Maroons winning 10 matches and
losing four of the 14 matches during their streak.
