             European stocks  closed little
changed at the highest level in a month as gains by insurers
offset a decline by auto-industry companies and a slump in
technology shares after Nokia Oyj cuts its forecasts.  
 Irish Life & Permanent Plc jumped 7.6 percent after
Deutsche Bank AG advised buying the shares. Celesio AG rose 4.3
percent as after saying it plans to form a Dutch joint venture
to distribute pharmaceuticals. Daimler AG dropped 2.8 percent,
leading auto shares lower. Nokia, the world’s biggest maker of
mobile phones, tumbled 9 percent.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  advanced less than 0.1 percent
to 254.47, having swung between gains and losses at least 16
times. The gauge has rebounded 9.6 percent from its 2010 low on
May 25 after concern about the impact of Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis pushed the benchmark gauge to its cheapest level relative
to earnings in more than a year.  
 “We’re caught between the worries about European
government bonds and recovery in the economy,” said  Jerome Forneris , who helps manage $11 billion at Banque Martin Maurel
in Marseille, France. “Here in Europe, our economic numbers are
mixed, but the leading economy is the U.S. If they are doing
well, we’ll benefit from that.”  
 U.S. Economy  
 Reports today showed U.S. industrial production rose last
month by the most since August while builders broke ground on
fewer homes than projected. Output at factories, mines and
utilities increased 1.2 percent after a 0.7 percent gain in
April, Federal Reserve data showed. Housing starts fell 10
percent, the biggest decline since March 2009, according to
figures from the Commerce Department.  
 National benchmark indexes rose in nine of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 and France’s CAC 40 gained
0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX climbed 0.3 percent.  
 Irish Life soared 7.6 percent to 1.86 euros, leading a
measure of insurance stocks 1.1 percent higher. Deutsche Bank
initiated coverage of the Dublin-based company with a  “buy” 
recommendation.  
 Automobile stocks lost 1.8 percent for the second-biggest
decline among the 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600. Daimler,
the world’s second-biggest luxury carmaker, slid 2.8 percent to
41.14 euros. Michelin & Cie., the second-largest tiremaker, sank
2.3 percent to 58.75 euros.  
 Celesio Climbs  
 Celesio gained 4.3 percent to 18.89 euros as Europe’s
largest publicly traded drug wholesaler said it’s forming a
joint venture with Phoenix Group in the Netherlands to
distribute pharmaceuticals.  
 Nokia sank 9 percent to 7.22 euros after cutting its
outlook for sales and margins, hurt by competition in high-end
phones from Apple Inc.’s iPhone and devices based on Google
Inc.’s Android software. The company said second-quarter handset
revenue and margins will be “at the lower end of or slightly
below” the range previously forecast and also cut its outlook
for the full year.  
 Nokia “is a good indicator for consumer spending,” said
 Julien Quistrebert , a fund manager at KBL Richelieu Gestion in
Paris, which oversees $3.7 billion in assets. “This is negative
in the scenario of an economic recovery. Things remain difficult
for Nokia. It’s bad news for the industry and can weigh on
semiconductor shares.”  
 Technology shares slid 1.8 percent for the biggest drop
among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. STMicroelectronics
NV, Europe’s largest chipmaker, lost 3.7 percent to 6.95 euros.  
 Aker Solutions ASA  slid 6 percent to 87.65 kroner after
Norway’s largest maker of oil platforms announced the
resignation of Chief Executive Officer  Simen Lieungh .  
 Jupiter Fund Management Plc jumped 15 percent to 190 pence
on its first day of trading in London. The money manager run by
 Edward Bonham Carter  raised 220 million pounds ($325 million) in
an initial public offering.
