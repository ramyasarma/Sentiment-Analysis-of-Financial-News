             Societe Generale SA Chief Executive
Officer Frederic Oudea told Les Echos in an interview that he is
ruling out any capital increase in current circumstances because
he believes that banking shares are undervalued.  
 The bank is able to carry out “small” purchases, such as
that of Societe Marseillaise de Credit, without raising funds,
Oudea told the newspaper.
