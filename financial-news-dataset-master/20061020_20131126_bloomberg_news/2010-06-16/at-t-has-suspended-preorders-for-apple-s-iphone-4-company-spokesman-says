             Apple Inc.  said it logged more than
600,000 early orders for the iPhone 4 yesterday, a record,
imposing a strain on computer systems and prompting carrier  AT&T
Inc.  to suspend sales of the device before its June 24 debut.  
 The number of preorders was the largest Apple has taken in
a single day, exceeding its expectations. AT&T and Apple started
accepting orders for the phone yesterday, with AT&T selling out
all the devices it had allocated for early ordering.  
 The surge in demand signals Apple Chief Executive Officer
 Steve Jobs  added enough features, such as video calling and a
sharper screen, to make the new iPhone alluring even as rival
phones using  Google Inc. ’s Android software gain ground. The
iPhone has become  Apple ’s top-selling product, accounting for 40
percent of revenue last quarter.  
 “We’re continuing to see an acceleration of the number of
phones that is sold at each launch,” said  Colin Gillis , a New
York-based analyst for BGC Partners LP. He recommends buying
Apple shares and said he doesn’t own any. “We have lots of room
to run in terms of how many of these things can be sold.”  
 Apple climbed $7.56, or 2.9 percent, to $267.25 in  Nasdaq
Stock Market   trading  at 4 p.m. New York time. AT&T, based in
Dallas, fell 2 cents to $25.52 on the New York Stock Exchange.  
 Ordering Glitches  
 Apple has sold more than 50 million iPhones after
introducing the device in 2007. The previous version, the iPhone
3GS, sold more than 1 million units in its opening weekend after
hitting store shelves in June 2009.  
 AT&T, the exclusive U.S. carrier for the iPhone, said
yesterday was the busiest online sales day in its history. The
carrier will withhold orders for the phone indefinitely,
depending on how soon it can replenish inventory. Apple said
many customers abandoned efforts to preorder the device after
growing frustrated with the process.  
 At Apple stores in San Francisco and New York yesterday,
staff recommended customers try ordering the device from Apple’s
website later in the day or today. Some calls to Apple’s
customer-service line weren’t getting through because of high
volume.  
 The iPhone 4 comes to market as Cupertino, California-based
Apple faces mounting competition from Google, whose Android
mobile-operating software runs handsets from HTC Corp. and
Motorola Inc.
