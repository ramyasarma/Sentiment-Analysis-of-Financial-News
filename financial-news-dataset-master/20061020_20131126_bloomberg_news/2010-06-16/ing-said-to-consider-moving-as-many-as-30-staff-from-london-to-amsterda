             ING Groep NV , the Netherlands’
biggest financial-services firm, may move as many as 30 workers
to Amsterdam from London to cut costs, according to a person
briefed on the discussions.  
 ING will probably move sales employees on the Western
European equity markets team, said the person, who spoke
anonymously because a final decision hasn’t been made. Some
employees may be given different roles in London.  
 The Amsterdam-based company may make a final decision as
soon as next week, the person said. The Eastern European
business isn’t part of the discussions.
