             Turkey froze all diplomatic and 
military relations with Israel, Star reported citing a decision
by the cabinet late yesterday.  
 Turkey shelved joint tank, plane and missile projects worth
more than $2.25 billion and won’t consider an Israeli bid for a
tank contract worth $5 billion, the Istanbul-based newspaper 
said. The government will no longer allow Israeli air force 
pilots to take part in military exercises in the country or 
send its pilots for training in Israel, Star said.  
 Turkey’s new ambassador to Tel Aviv Kerim Uras won’t be 
dispatched to the country until Israel agrees a United Nations 
probe into the killing of nine Turks in a May 31 commando raid 
on a Gaza-strip bound aid flotilla, the newspaper reported 
citing the decision.
