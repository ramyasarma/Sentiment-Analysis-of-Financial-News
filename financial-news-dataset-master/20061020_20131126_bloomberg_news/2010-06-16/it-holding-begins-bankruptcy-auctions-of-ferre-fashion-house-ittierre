             Administrators for  IT Holding SpA ,
the Italian fashion company in bankruptcy protection since
February 2009, started the auctions of the  Gianfranco Ferre 
brand and Ittierre SpA production unit.  
 Potential bidders for Ferre fashion house can apply for
access to the Milan-based label’s data room and must meet a July
6 deadline for binding offers, the administrators said today in
an e-mailed statement.  
 Potential bidders for Ittierre, which makes clothing under
license for  Roberto Cavalli  and  John Galliano , must submit a
non-binding letter of interest by June 23 to be allowed to carry
out due diligence from June 27 to July 25, the administrators
said. The deadline for binding offers for Ittierre is August 2.  
 Italy’s  Industry Ministry  must authorize the sale of each
company. Malo, IT Holding’s cashmere brand, has received four
bids, all from Italian companies, the administrators said June
3, which was the deadline for binding offers.
