             North Korea, whose border guards 
shot dead three Chinese on June 3, has paid $3,000 each to the 
families of the victims, Daily NK reported, citing a North 
Korean trader in the Chinese border city of Dandong it didn’t 
identify.   
 North Korea apologized for the incident, which it said was 
an accident, the Seoul-based news agency reported today on its 
website.   
 China’s Foreign Ministry said on June 8 the country made a 
formal diplomatic protest to North Korea for the shooting, 
which also left another Chinese injured.
