             Spain will cut the revenue of
existing photovoltaic plants by 30 percent, said Tomas Diaz,
director of external relations at the Photovoltaic Industry
Association.  
 The subsidies for new ground-based photovoltaic generators
will be reduced by 45 percent while panels mounted on large
roofs will see a 25 percent reduction and those on small roofs
will be cut by 5 percent, Diaz said following a meeting with
Deputy Industry Minister Pedro Marin.
