             Iran will double the denomination of
its largest banknote to 100,000 rials ($9.98),  Central Bank 
Governor  Mahmoud Bahmani  said.  
 The Persian Gulf country will print at least 150 million of
the new notes and distribute them over three months, starting
June 22, Bahmani was cited as saying today by the state-run  Mehr 
news agency. The issuance of the notes won’t increase the
inflation rate, he said.  
 “Astronomical” inflation in recent years prompted Iran to
create the new banknote and subsidy cuts will revive price
increases,  Kamran Dadkhah , associate professor in the Economics
Department at Boston-based Northeastern University, said in a
telephone interview. “They have to print notes in larger
denominations, otherwise people will have to take a sack of them
to buy a sandwich,” he said.  
 Iranian economists and lawmakers have warned that moves
under way to reduce state subsidies for consumer goods and
gasoline, and replace them with cash handouts to the poor, will
stoke inflation. Economist  Ahmad Tavakoli , a senior member of
parliament, predicted in November 2008 that the handouts could
boost the annual inflation rate to 50 percent.  
 Inflation slowed to 9.9 percent as of May 21 from 10.4
percent a month earlier, in line with the forecast in a five-
year economic development plan published in 2005, the year
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  was elected to his first term. The
annual inflation rate peaked at 29.4 percent in September 2008.  
 “At the time of the 1979 Revolution, a dollar equaled 70
rials; now it is more than 10,000,” Dadkhah said. “The real
value, according to analysts, is 20,000 to 25,000 rials. It
means prices have increased at least 300 times.”  
 Bahmani said the new banknotes will be used in place of the
“check-poul,” a check-type document of at least 500,000 rials
that Iranians can buy from banks to use in transactions
requiring multiples of the current maximum-denomination
banknote,  50,000 rials . A check-poul can be transferred between
individuals in the same way as cash, and is then canceled when
presented to a bank for deposit.
