             Iraq, carrying a $40 billion debt
burden from the  Saddam Hussein  era, agreed to forgive 80 percent
of loans owed by Madagascar, government spokesman  Ali Al-Dabbagh 
said.  
 Madagascar will have to pay back only 20 percent of the
debt, amounting to about $47 million, in twice-yearly
instalments over seven years starting on Nov. 15, 2010, he said
in an e-mailed statement.  
 Iraq’s Council of Ministers has asked the ministries of
finance and foreign affairs to settle the issue of debt owed by
developing countries, he said.  
 Iraq has also set aside 5 percent of its oil revenue to pay
its own Saddam-era debt. It may hold the world’s third-largest
oil reserves, although sectarian violence and political
conflicts have hampered economic revival since the U.S.-led
invasion in 2003 that ousted Saddam Hussein’s regime.
