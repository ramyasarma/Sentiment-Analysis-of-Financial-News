             Senate Banking Committee Chairman
 Christopher Dodd  is prepared to drop a proposal to make the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York president a political appointee
after Fed officials objected to the change.  
 Senate negotiators on an overhaul of financial legislation
will accept House Financial Services Committee Chairman  Barney Frank ’s offer to instead reduce the role of banks in appointing
all 12 regional Fed presidents, according to a counteroffer
released by Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
