             BP Plc  said a worker was killed in a
construction accident today at the U.K. company’s refinery in
Rotterdam.  
 The man, employed by Mourik, a construction company
contracted by BP, was crushed by a piece of concrete foundation
that was being moved at the site, BP spokesman Carlo Eijkels
said by telephone today.  
 Local broadcaster RTV Rijnmond reported that the building
material fell from a crane. The refinery is able to  process 
400,000 barrels of oil a day.
