             Gold prices fell on bets that a
rally to a one-week high was overdone.  
 The metal reached $1,239.50 an ounce, the highest price
since June 9, amid European sovereign-debt concerns. Gold has
climbed 12 percent this year, reaching a record $1,254.50 on
June 8.  
 “Gold has trouble at these higher prices,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois. “Gold doesn’t want to go over $1,250, and
it doesn’t want to go under $1,210.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $3.90, or 0.3
percent, to $1,230.50 on the Comex in New York. The price is
down 1.9 percent from the all-time high.  
 The metal may be too expensive to attract new investors,
some analysts said.  
 “We favor standing aside in gold until prices fall toward
technical support in the $1,198 to $1,210 range,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd., a broker in
Chicago.  
 Europe’s fiscal woes will spur a rebound in gold, analysts
said.  
 The euro may drop to the lowest level since 2003 on
Europe’s debt crisis, Sophia Drossos, a co-head of global
currency strategy at Morgan Stanley, said today in an interview
with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio. Gold denominated in euros,
Swiss francs, and the U.K. pound also rose to records this year.  
 “All the buying has been out of Europe,” Kaplan said.
“Europeans know the debt crisis is not going away, and they’re
buying gold to protect themselves from a decline in the euro.”  
 Silver futures for July delivery fell 13.7 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $18.441 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $10.50, or 0.7
percent, to $1,567.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery were little
changed at $475.20 an ounce.
