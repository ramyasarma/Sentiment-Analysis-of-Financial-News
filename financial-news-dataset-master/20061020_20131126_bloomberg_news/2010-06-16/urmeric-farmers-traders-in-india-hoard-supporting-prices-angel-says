             Growers and traders of turmeric in
India, the world’s largest producer and exporter, are hoarding
the spice, according to Angel Commodities Pvt., likely
supporting domestic prices that have doubled in the past year.  
 Turmeric, a yellow-colored spice used in cooking, climbed
to a record 15,905 rupees ($343) per 10 metric tons on May 6 on
India’s National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd. Prices
have since declined 7.6 percent.  
 “The farmers, if prices are quite good, say something
above 16,500 rupees, they bring in more arrivals to reap the
profits,” Nalini Rao, research analyst at Angel Commodities,
said by phone from Mumbai. “When they see prices are falling,
they hold stocks. They are not ready to sell at lower levels.”  
 Turmeric prices have surged after production declined in
the past two years, she said. Output totaled about 4.2 million
bags in 2008-2009 and 4.8 million bags the following year. That
is less than 5 million to 5.2 million bags, a level considered
normal, Rao said. Indians consume 4.5 million bags annually,
each weighing 70 kilograms (154 pounds), Rao said.  
 Futures for July delivery, the most-active contract, fell
as much as 1.8 percent to 14,570 rupees per 10 tons and traded
at 14,688 rupees at 1:37 p.m. in Mumbai.  
 Prices may “correct” in the second half of the year or
early next year as forecasts for good monsoon rainfall induce
farmers to plant bigger crops, she said. The new crop will
arrive next January or February, Rao said.
