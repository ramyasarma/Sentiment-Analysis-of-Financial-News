             BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s largest and third-largest mining companies,
said Australia’s government gave no sign at a meeting today that
it will compromise on its proposed mine profit tax.  
 “At present there is no formal acknowledgement from the
government” that the mining industry’s tax concerns will be
addressed, BHP, Rio and Xstrata Plc said in a joint statement
after the talks in Canberra.  
 Global mining companies are reviewing, suspending or
slowing Australian projects because of Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd ’s plan to introduce a 40 percent tax on mine profits
starting from 2012. BHP, Rio and Xstrata want the government to
exclude existing projects from the tax and reconsider the rate.  
 “What is abundantly clear to us is that had this tax been
in place 10 years ago, we would not have invested as much as we
have in the Pilbara and Rio Tinto would have been a much smaller
producer of iron ore today,” Rio’s Chairman  Jan Du Plessis  said
in a letter to shareholders today. Rio is Australia’s biggest
iron ore producer.  
 The tax rate won’t change and won’t be set at different
levels for various commodities, Australia’s Resources Minister
 Martin Ferguson  said today in a radio interview with the
Australian Broadcasting Corp.  
 A first report outlining the issues under discussion will
be released next month and a final document late this year,
according to the government. Legislation will be put to
parliament in late 2011 if the Rudd government is re-elected at
a national ballot due by April.
