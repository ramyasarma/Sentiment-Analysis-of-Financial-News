             The spread between United Nations
offsets and European Union carbon permits for delivery in
2012 narrowed to the lowest level in five weeks on speculation
that regulatory changes may reduce UN supply.  
 The spread between UN and EU permits for 2012 was at 3.81
euros ($4.68) a metric ton as of 11:06 a.m. on London’s European
Climate Exchange, compared with 3.93 euros yesterday. That’s the
smallest discount since May 7.  
 Investors are pricing in a risk that additional scrutiny
and potential new UN restrictions may curb issuance of offset
credits for destroying a potent greenhouse gas called
hydrofluorocarbon-23, said  Emmanuel Fages , a Paris-based
analysts for Orbeo, Societe Generale SA’s carbon venture with
Rhodia SA.  
 “There could be some impact of the HFC story as investors
do not know what the CDM methodology panel’s decisions will
be,” he said by phone. “If we see a lower supply of offset
credits it could increase the price.”  
 The tightening of the spread also reflects lower liquidity,
he said. The volume traded today was 61,000 tons, down from
305,000 yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  
 There are safeguards to “prevent perverse incentives”
from HFC projects to cause more pollution, UN carbon-market
spokesman David Abbass said by e-mail yesterday.  
 HFCs, emitted in the production of chemicals for air
conditioning and refrigeration, gained favor in the 1970s as an
alternative to chlorofluorocarbons, which scientists linked to
depletion of the ozone layer. While HFCs don’t interfere as much
with the earth’s shield against damaging sunrays, they trap heat
and contribute to global warming.  
 About half of the 414.2 million Certified Emission
Reduction credits issued since October 2005 by the UN’s  Clean
Development Mechanism , the second-largest emissions market, stem
from plans to cut HFCs, according to UN data.  
 The European Commission, regulator of the EU program, said
last month that projects related to HFC-23 and nitrous oxide
create significant windfall profits and may be banned for use in
its own carbon market after 2012.  
 Carbon allowances for delivery in December 2010 in the EU
emissions-trading system, the world’s biggest cap-and-trade
program, dropped 0.3 percent to 15.74 euros per ton.
