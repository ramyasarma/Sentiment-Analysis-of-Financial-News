             Doha Bank QSC , Qatar’s third-biggest
bank by assets, may raise as much as $1 billion by selling bonds
in the fourth quarter, its chief executive officer said.  
 The money is likely to be raised for five years after the
summer and is meant to “fix the maturity mismatch” on the bank’s
balance sheet,  Raghavan Seetharaman  said in a phone interview
from Doha today. The bank has not decided which currency to sell
the bonds in, he said.  
 Doha Bank plans to sell senior bonds in U.S. dollars, the
lender told the Qatari bourse on April 19, without disclosing
the size of the program.
