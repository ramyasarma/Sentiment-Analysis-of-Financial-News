             Zodiac Aerospace SA Chief Executive
Officer Olivier Zarrouati told La Tribune in an interview that
he believes a merger with another French company is unlikely.  
 There aren’t any French companies that could generate
enough cost savings by merging with Zodiac, he said, when asked
about the possibility of Zodiac being absorbed by Safran SA.
