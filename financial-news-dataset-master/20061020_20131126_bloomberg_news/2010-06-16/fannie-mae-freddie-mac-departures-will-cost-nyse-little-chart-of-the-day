             The New York Stock Exchange has
relatively little to lose from the regulatory decision that
required Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give up their listings.  
 As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the exchange handled only
about 13 percent of the common shares in the mortgage-finance
companies that traded during the first half of June. The chart
displays the NYSE’s monthly percentages since the start of 2009.  
 The exchange’s market share dropped as low as 8.8 percent
for Fannie Mae and 9.1 percent for Freddie Mac within the last
12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Most trading in the stocks was completed over electronic
networks and reported through the Alternative Display Facility,
run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. This process
accounted for 55 percent of the common shares changing hands in
each company since last year.  
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said today that they would
delist under orders from their regulator, the Federal Housing
Finance Agency. The decision covers their preferred shares as
well as the common.  
 Both companies kept listings on the NYSE, a unit of NYSE
Euronext, after government takeovers in September 2008. Fannie
Mae was in danger of failing to meet the exchange’s $1 minimum
price requirement. Its shares last closed above that threshold
on May 14. Freddie Mac closed at less than $1 from December 2008
through July 2009.
