             Too many customers watching the
World Cup and too few buying software and computers means the
soccer tournament may wind up a “yellow card” for earnings at
U.S. technology companies,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  said.  
 In the quarter coinciding with three of the past five World
Cups, technology companies on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
had their biggest earnings-per-share misses of the year,  Sarah Friar , a San Francisco-based Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a
report this week. By contrast, the April-to-June period was the
worst quarter in only three of the past 15 non-tournament years
since 1990, she wrote.  
 “World Cup-year second quarters appear more susceptible to
missing consensus estimates,” she wrote. “With macro and
currency concerns already weighing on technology stocks, some
view the World Cup as another possible near-term negative.”  
 The planet’s most popular sporting event kicked off last
week and is expected to draw half a billion TV viewers globally
by the time it ends July 11, according to  FIFA , soccer’s
governing body. Even in the U.S., where the sport’s popularity
lags behind American football and basketball, some 14.5 million
people tuned in a match this week between the home team and
England, according to estimates from ratings-company Nielsen Co.  
 Other fans are using vacation days to attend the matches in
South Africa. Average attendance per game has been 53,019, up
from 52,167 at the same stage of the 2006 World Cup in Germany,
FIFA spokesman  Nicolas Maingot  said at a news conference in
Johannesburg this week.  
 ‘Not Overwhelming’  
 “Some impact is a possibility, though the likelihood is not
overwhelming,” Friar said in the report. She  recommends  buying
Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. shares and rates SAP AG
“neutral.”  
 The worst performance for S&P 500 technology companies
during a World Cup quarter in the past 20 years occurred in 1990
when the tournament was held in Italy. More than 50 percent of
the companies fell short of analysts’ average estimates,
according to Friar’s report. The U.S.-hosted 1994 World Cup and
the 2002 games in Japan and Korea also coincided with quarters
that were worse than the rest of the year.  
 For investors concerned about the impact, Friar notes that
the round of 16 will fall at the end of the second quarter,
while the later rounds take place at the beginning of the third
quarter. The final is scheduled July 11.  
 The  information technology sub-index  of the  S&P 500  has
risen 3.7 percent since June 11, when the tournament started,
while the broader index gained 2.6 percent.
