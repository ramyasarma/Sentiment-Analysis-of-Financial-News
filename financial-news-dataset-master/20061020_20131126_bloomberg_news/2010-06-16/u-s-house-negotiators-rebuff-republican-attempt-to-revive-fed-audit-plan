             U.S. House lawmakers negotiating an
overhaul of financial regulation rebuffed an attempt by
Republicans to revive a measure that would remove the Federal
Reserve’s shield against audits of its interest-rate decisions.  
 House members on a joint conference committee voted 12-7
against the Fed audit measure backed by Representative  Ron Paul ,
a Republican from Texas. The proposal, part of legislation
passed in December by the House, was rejected during Senate
debate and isn’t in the text of a bill lawmakers are amending in
House-Senate negotiations.  
 The Senate in May approved opening the Fed to a one-time
audit of its emergency loans and other efforts to end the
financial crisis starting in December 2007. House Financial
Services Committee Chairman  Barney Frank  has proposed going
further by requiring the central bank, after a two-year delay,
to name firms that borrow through its discount window and
participate in the Fed’s purchases or sales of assets such as
mortgage-backed securities.  
 “Two years is enough to make it old history,”  Charles Lieberman , chief investment officer at Advisors Capital
Management LLC in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, and a former
head of the monetary analysis staff at the New York Fed, said in
an interview with Bloomberg Radio. “The Fed could probably live
with that.”
