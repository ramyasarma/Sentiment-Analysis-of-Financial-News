             Gold prices fluctuated on
speculation that the euro will resume a slump, boosting the
appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.  
 The euro may drop to the lowest level since 2003 on
Europe’s debt crisis,  Sophia Drossos , the co-head of global
currency strategy at Morgan Stanley, said today in an interview
with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Radio. Before today, gold rose 13
percent this year, reaching a record $1,254.50 an ounce on June
8, as the euro tumbled 14 percent.  
 “Gold has trouble at these higher prices,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the president of Prospector Asset Management in
Evanston, Illinois. “Gold doesn’t want to go over $1,250, and
it doesn’t want to go under $1,210. If the euro weakens further,
gold is going higher.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $1.80, or 0.1
percent, to $1,232.60 an ounce at 12:06 p.m. on the Comex.
Earlier, the metal declined as much as 0.3 percent and gained as
much as 0.4 percent.  
 Gold denominated in euros, Swiss francs, and the U.K. pound
also rose to records this year.  
 “All the buying has been out of Europe,” Kaplan said.
“Europeans know the debt crisis is not going away, and they’re
buying gold to protect themselves from a decline in the euro.”  
 Gold may be too expensive to attract new investors, some
analysts said.  
 “We favor standing aside in gold until prices fall toward
technical support in the $1,198 to $1,210 range,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd., a broker in
Chicago.  
 Silver futures for July delivery fell 10.8 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $18.47 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $8.60, or 0.5
percent, to $1,569.40 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery declined 10 cents
to $475.45 an ounce.
