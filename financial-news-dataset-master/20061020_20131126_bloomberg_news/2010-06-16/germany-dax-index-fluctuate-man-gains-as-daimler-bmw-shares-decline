             German stocks  rose for a third day
as gains at MAN SE and BASF SE overshadowed a report that showed
U.S. builders broke ground on fewer homes than anticipated.  
 MAN advanced 1.4 percent as rival Volvo AB reported a surge
in truck deliveries. BASF rose with European chemicals shares.
Celesio AG rose 4.3 percent after the biggest publicly traded
drug wholesaler in Europe said it’s forming a joint venture with
Phoenix Group in the Netherlands to distribute Pharmaceuticals.
 Daimler AG  and  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  both declined more
than 2 percent.  
 The  DAX Index  gained 0.3 percent to 6,190.91, closing at
the highest level since May 13. The benchmark gauge has rallied
9.2 percent since May 25 after concern about the impact of
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis pushed the measure near its
cheapest level relative to earnings in more than a year. The
broader  HDAX Index  advanced 0.2 percent to 3,129.09 today.  
 Housing starts fell 10 percent, the biggest decline since
March 2009, to a 593,000 annual rate, from a revised 659,000
pace in April that was less than previously estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. Building permits,
a sign of future construction, unexpectedly fell to a one-year
low. Single-family starts suffered the largest drop since 1991.  
 Industrial Production  
 A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed
industrial production in the U.S. rose in May by the most since
August, led by increases in automobiles and utilities and
showing manufacturers are weathering the effects of the European
debt crisis.  
 European inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in more
than a year in May as surging energy costs and a weaker euro
made imported goods more expensive across the 16-nation region,
the European Union statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  
 MAN SE , Europe’s third-largest truckmaker, rose 1.4 percent
to 68.36 euros after Sweden’s Volvo, the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, reported a 44 percent rise in truck deliveries to
13,577 vehicles in May.  
 BASF, the world’s biggest chemicals maker, climbed 0.4
percent to 46.33 euros, an eighth straight advance for the
longest winning streak in almost 11 months. Chemicals shares
gained as much as 0.7 percent today, among the best performers
in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 Celesio, Sixt  
 Celesio rose 4.3 percent to 18.89 euros. The stock gained
after the company said it’s forming a joint venture with Phoenix
Group in the Netherlands to distribute pharmaceuticals.  
 Celesio said it will contribute 62 drugstores with annual
sales totaling 170 million euros ($209 million) to Brocacef
Holding NV, a Phoenix subsidiary. Celesio will own 45 percent of
Brocacef, a drug wholesaler and pharmacy operator, the company
said.  
 Sixt AG  climbed 4.1 percent to 16.65 euros, erasing
yesterday’s 1.2 percent loss. The company aims to return to pre-
crisis earnings levels next year, Handelsblatt reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer  Erich Sixt . The German
car-hire company expects to earn more in 2010 than in 2009,
according to the newspaper report.  
 Daimler  tumbled 2.8 percent to 41.14 euros, sliding for the
fourth day, while BMW, the world’s largest luxury-car maker,
fell 2.1 percent to 39.03 euros.  
 “Daimler and BMW were among auto companies who benefited
over the past few weeks from a stronger dollar,” said  Daniel Schwarz , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “With the
euro gaining in the past few days, some investors may be taking
some profits.”  
 ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG dropped 1.4 percent to 12.62 euros,
the first decline this week. The German broadcaster said it’s
selling the news television station N24 and production company
MAZ&MORE to a group including the station’s management and
former Der Spiegel Editor-in-Chief Stefan Aust.
