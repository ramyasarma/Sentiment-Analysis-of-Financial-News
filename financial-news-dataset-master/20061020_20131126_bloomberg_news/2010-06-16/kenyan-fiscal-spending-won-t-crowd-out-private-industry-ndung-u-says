             Kenya’s plan to increase spending on
road and energy projects and borrow on the local market won’t
come at the expense of investment by private industry, central
bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said.  
 “It won’t crowd out” other investment, Ndung’u said in an
interview in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, today. “In fact, it
is crowding in because it is going to invest in reducing the
cost of doing business.”  
 Kenya plans to borrow 105.3 billion shillings ($1.3
billion) from the local market and 82.7 billion shillings
through net foreign financing in the fiscal year starting July
1, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his budget speech on
June 10. Much of the money will be invested in road and energy
projects, he said.  
 The country’s poor infrastructure including potholed roads
and unreliable power supplies is an obstacle as the government
aims to boost growth to 4.5 percent in 2010 and 5.7 percent the
year after, from an estimated 2.6 percent in 2009.  
 East Africa’s largest economy has allocated 78.6 billion
shillings to build and renovate roads in 2010-11, up by 34
percent from this year, Kenyatta said. Another 34.1 billion
shillings is earmarked for energy projects, he said.  
 Debt Sales  
 Plans for government debt issuance, including the possible
sale of infrastructure bonds for the next fiscal year, is still
a work in progress, said Ndung’u today, without elaborating.  
 Kenya plans to wait until the end of this financial year on
June 30 to make a final decision on whether to push forward with
the sale of an international bond, Ndung’u said on May 26. The
country postponed a sovereign bond sale planned for 2008 after
the global financial crisis crimped investors’ appetite for risk
and tightened credit markets.  
 Kenya may start to sell more long-dated debt, said Ndung’u.  
 “The time is now to shift the government debt to longer
term,” he said. Kenya will sell 7.5 billion shillings of 25-
year treasury bonds on June 23, the Central Bank of Kenya said
on June 10.
