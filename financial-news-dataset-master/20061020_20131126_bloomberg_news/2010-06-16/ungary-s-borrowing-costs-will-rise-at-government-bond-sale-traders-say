             Hungary’s borrowing costs will rise
at an auction of government bonds tomorrow as investors await
details on measures to plug budget holes, bond traders at the
local units of KBC Groep NV and BNP Paribas SA said.  
 Hungary is seeking to raise 50 billion forint ($219
million) in government bonds due in 2013, 2016 and 2020. The
government failed to sell the planned amount of 12-month
Treasury-bills at an auction last week. Results will be released
at 11:30 a.m. in Budapest.  
 The yield on the benchmark three-year bond rose 0.3
percentage points since the last auction on June 3 to 6.819
percent today after ruling-party officials raised the prospect
of a default. The forint tumbled to a year low and is still 2
percent lower than before the remarks that also compared
Hungary’s situation to that of Greece.  
 “I’m not concerned that tomorrow’s auction will be a
failure, though costs will be higher,” said  Krisztian Toth , a
bond trader at BNP Paribas in Budapest. “The auction results
will be an important indicator for investors, the entire market
is awaiting this sale.”  
 The forint traded at 280.87 per euro at 3:12 p.m. in
Budapest, compared with 279.32 yesterday. The currency fell to a
year low of 290.52 on June 7 after the default-related comments.
The yield on the 2016 forint bond surged to 7.78 percent on June
7 from 7.18 percent on June 3 and the yield on the 2013 note
jumped to 6.90 on June 7 from 6.47 on June 3.  
 Budget Target  
 Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  pledged to freeze public
spending and impose a tax on financial institutions to narrow
the budget deficit to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this
year. The target was approved by the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Union, which provided the bulk of a 20 billion-
euro ($25 billion) bailout in 2008.  
 Concern the Greek sovereign crisis may spread is driving
borrowing costs higher across the region. International buyers
will only return to the Hungarian market when the government
“clarifies how exactly it plans to meet the budget deficit
target” and clarifies the measures it plans to take, said  Attila Eszes , trader at KBC’s unit in Budapest.  
 “It’s possible that the economic action plan of the
government will persuade a hedge fund or two to enter the
auction,” Eszes said. “Local institutions won’t be able to
subscribe the entire amount as they’re already heavily
positioned in long bonds.”  
 Polish, Czech Bonds  
 Poland today attracted the lowest demand for 10-year bonds
since 2008, raising 2.43 billion zloty ($728 million) as the
average yield rose to 5.791 percent from 5.586 percent at the
previous auction. The Czech Republic sold 6.95 billion koruna
($333 million of debt due in 2024, with the yield rising to
4.582 percent from 4.332 percent.  
 Hungary plans 1.3 trillion forint ($5.9 billion) in debt
sales in the third quarter. The plan includes the sale of 350
billion forint of government bonds, 585 billion forint of three-
month Treasury bills and 350 billion forint of one-year Treasury
bills. Net issuance, the difference between maturing and new
debt, will be 303 billion forint, including 8.3 billion forint
in bonds.
