             European stocks erased their advance
as the euro weakened and the yield premium investors demand to
hold Spanish 10-year government bonds instead of German bunds
rose to a euro-era record.  
 The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was little changed at 254.38 as
of 9:01 a.m. in London, having earlier climbed as much as 0.6
percent.  
 Newspaper El Economista reported that the International
Monetary Fund, the EU and the U.S. Treasury are putting together
a credit line of as much as 250 billion euros for Spain.
