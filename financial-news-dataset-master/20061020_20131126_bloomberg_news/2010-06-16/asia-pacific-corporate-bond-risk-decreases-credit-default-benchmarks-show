             The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  
 The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 7 basis points to
128.5 basis points as of 10:28 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Nomura Holdings Inc.  The Markit  iTraxx Japan index  fell 6 basis
points to 138 basis points as of 8:44 a.m. in Tokyo, according
to Morgan Stanley prices.  
 The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 5 basis points to 133 basis
points as of 8:40 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement.  
 The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.
