             The average coverage ratio of Dutch
pension funds continued to decline last month as shares and the
long-term interest rate fell, the Dutch central bank said.  
 Preliminary calculations show the coverage ratio, or the
amount of assets relative to future benefit payments, fell to 98
percent at the end of May from 109 percent reported at the end
of 2009, according to the central bank’s quarterly report
published today.  
 “The reserve shortfall of the pension sector as a whole
makes that it has insufficient ability to cope with new
shocks,” the Amsterdam-based bank, led by  Nout Wellink , said.
“The system needs to be better prepared against demographic and
unfavorable economic developments.”  
 Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP , the largest Dutch pension
fund, last week said its coverage ratio dropped to 96 percent as
of May 31 from 102 percent at the end of April. Funds aren’t
allowed to raise pension payments as long as the ratio is below
the central bank’s regulatory minimum of 105 percent.
