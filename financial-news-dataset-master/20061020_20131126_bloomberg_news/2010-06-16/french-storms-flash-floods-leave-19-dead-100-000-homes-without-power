             Storms and flooding yesterday in the
Var region of southern France left 19 dead and 100,000 homes
without power.  
 The French grid operator ERDF has sent 150 agents to help
restore power, though water levels have made access “very
difficult,” company spokesman Philippe Gluck said. The number
of deaths was reported by French television channel TF1, without
saying where it got the information.  
 It is still too early to estimate the total cost of the
rescue operation or say when power will be restored, ERDF’s
Gluck said. The region may see further storms, the Var local
authority said in  a statement  on its website.
