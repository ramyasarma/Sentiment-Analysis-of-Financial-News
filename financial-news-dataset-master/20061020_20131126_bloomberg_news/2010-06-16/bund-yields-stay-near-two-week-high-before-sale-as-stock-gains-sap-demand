             Spanish and Portuguese bonds fell
relative to German bunds amid deepening concern the nations’
economic growth will be curtailed by spending cuts needed to
reduce their budget deficits.  
 The  premium  that investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
government bonds over German bunds rose to a euro-era record.
The European Union today “firmly” denied a report that the
International Monetary Fund, the EU and the U.S. Treasury are
putting together a credit line of as much as 250 billion euros
($307 billion) for Spain’s government. Spanish and Portuguese
debt levels may “snowball” in coming years and more budget
cuts are needed, according to a draft European Commission
document obtained by Bloomberg yesterday.  
 “The European Commission draft suggests bigger problems in
the periphery, and the market is looking for the next Greece,”
said  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income research at HSBC
Holdings Plc in London. “The market is not necessarily right.
The rescue fund is pretty impressive,” he said, referring to
the 750-billion-euro EU rescue fund announced a month ago.  
 Spanish 10-year government bond yields rose 15 basis points
to 4.93 percent as of 4:20 p.m. in London. The 4 percent
security due April 2020 fell 1.14, or 11.4 euros per 1,000-euro
face amount, to 92.83. The Portuguese 10-year yield climbed 17
basis points to 5.72 percent.  
 The yield premium for Spanish 10-year government bonds over
German bunds rose 14 basis points to 220 basis points, the
widest spread since before the euro’s debut in 1999.  
 ‘Private’ Meeting  
 Spanish Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  told reporters in
Madrid today that she’ll talk to investors at a “private”
meeting on June 18 to explain plans to cut the deficit and
restructure the financial system. Salgado said the meeting was
routine, without elaborating.  
 Greek 30-year bonds fell, with the price of the benchmark
closing below 50 for the first time since it was issued in
2007. The yield on the bond rose 42 basis points to 10.03
percent. The price fell 2.55 to 48.85.  
 Soaring bond yields in nations including Greece, Ireland
and Portugal forced the EU to craft the rescue package and the
European Central Bank to begin buying government bonds. European
governments are still struggling to contain market concern, with
yield premiums now higher than when the plan was introduced. The
Spanish yield difference slid 68 basis points to 97 basis points
on May 10 after the EU announced the plan.  
 Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  is trying to
convince investors he can trim the euro region’s third-largest
deficit, shore up the country’s banks and lift the economy out
of a two-year slump. Spanish unions called for the first general
strike in eight years to protest an overhaul in the country’s
labor-laws, which the cabinet approved today.  
 Bond Redemptions  
 The country faces 16.2 billion euros of bond redemptions
next month and the decline in its debt in secondary markets
means it will have to offer higher returns to attract investors.  
 Spain plans to sell 3.5 billion euros of 2020 and 2041
bonds tomorrow in a test of market sentiment toward the
Mediterranean nation. Its borrowing costs rose at an auction of
12- and 18-month bills yesterday.  
 “The market is focused on tomorrow’s longer bond supply,
especially the 30-year sale,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “Yesterday’s
bills auction showed that spreads are widening for Spain across
the curve.”  
 The yield on the  bund , Europe’s benchmark government
security, was little changed at 2.68 percent.  
 Debt Crisis  
 Germany sold 4.06 billion euros of 3 percent bonds maturing
in 2020 at an average yield of 2.67 percent. The securities
attracted 1.6 times more bids than were offered, compared with
an average of 1.55 at the last two auctions of the same notes.  
 Bund yields touched the lowest since at least 1989 on June
8 amid speculation that weaker euro-region economies will be
overwhelmed by their debts, stoking demand for the perceived
safety of German fixed-income assets. The crisis has driven the
16-nation currency down 20 percent between last year’s high on
Nov. 25, 2009, and the end of last week.  
 A German government official said Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government is not aware of any preparations by the EU
and the IMF to help Spain. The government doesn’t see any
grounds to make such preparations, either, the official said
today in Berlin, speaking on condition of anonymity.  
 “We shouldn’t create a self-fulfilling prophecy” by
speculating on which countries may need to access the aid
package, Merkel said on June 14.  
 Portuguese borrowing costs rose at an auction of 718
million euros of nine-month bills, which it sold at an average
yield of 2.69 percent compared with 2.44 percent in May.  
 Spanish government bonds lost investors 3.6 percent this
year, compared with returns of 6.5 percent for German bonds and
a 14.5 percent loss for Greek debt, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.
