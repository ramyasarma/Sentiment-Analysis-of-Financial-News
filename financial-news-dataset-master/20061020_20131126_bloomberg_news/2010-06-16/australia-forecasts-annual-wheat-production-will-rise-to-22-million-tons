             Australia, the world’s fourth-
largest wheat exporter, kept its forecast for the next harvest
little changed, according to a government agency.  
 Output may be 22.1 million metric tons in 2010-11, compared
with a March estimate of 21.94 million tons, the Canberra-based
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics said
today in an e-mailed report. Production the previous season was
21.66 million tons, the bureau said.  
 Farmers typically plant winter crops including wheat and
canola from April to June in Australia, with harvesting
completed by January. Beneficial rainfall in recent weeks had
“supported a positive start” to the season, Rabobank Groep NV
said in a report last week.  
 The opening of the winter-cropping season in Australia’s
eastern states “is one of the best for several years,” Paul
Morris, the bureau’s deputy executive director, said in the
report. The forecast output would be a 2 percent increase from
this financial year, assuming average yields, the bureau said.  
 Wheat for September delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade
gained 0.1 percent to $4.6775 a bushel at 10:31 a.m. Melbourne
time. The futures have dropped 30 percent in the past 12 months
amid rising global stockpiles.  
 Canola production next harvest may reach 2 million tons,
the bureau said, raising its outlook from a March estimate of
1.6 million tons. Output last year was 1.9 million tons,
according to the agency.  
 The total winter-cropping area next year may fall 1 percent
to 22.1 million hectares, with total winter-crop production
forecast to reach 35.1 million tons compared with 35.2 million
tons last season, the bureau said.
