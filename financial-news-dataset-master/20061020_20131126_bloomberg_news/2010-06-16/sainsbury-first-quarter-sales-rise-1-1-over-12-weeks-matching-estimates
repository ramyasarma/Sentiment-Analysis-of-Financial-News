             J Sainsbury Plc, the U.K.’s third-
largest supermarket owner, said sales at stores open at least a
year rose 1.1 percent, excluding fuel and including value-added
tax, in the 12 weeks ended June 12. That compares with the 1
percent median estimate of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg.
