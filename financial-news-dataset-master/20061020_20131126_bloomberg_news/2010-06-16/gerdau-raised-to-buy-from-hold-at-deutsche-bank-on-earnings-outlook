             Gerdau SA, Latin America’s biggest
steelmaker, was raised to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank
AG, which said the company’s earnings will probably increase and
it has a “positive strategy outlook.”  
 Deutsche Bank boosted its one-year price estimate for the
company’s American depositary receipts to $19 from $18,
according to a research note dated yesterday.
