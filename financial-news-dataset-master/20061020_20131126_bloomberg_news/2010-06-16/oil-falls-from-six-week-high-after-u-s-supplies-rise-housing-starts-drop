             Oil fell from a six-week high after
a government report showed U.S. crude supplies increased last
week as refiners cut processing, and as  declining  housing starts
fanned concern over the strength of the economic recovery.  
 Oil reversed yesterday’s 1 percent gain after the Commerce
Department said new U.S. home construction fell 10 percent in
May, the most since March last year. Crude  supplies  unexpectedly
increased 1.69 million barrels, the Energy Department said. A
median 1 million-barrel drop was forecast by analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  
 “Inventories are generally still pretty high, but the oil
price has held up well relatively,” said  David Moore , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in
Sydney. “Markets are still assuming a U.S. recovery, albeit an
uneven recovery road.”  
 Crude for July delivery dropped as much as 80 cents, or 1
percent, to $76.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $77.04 at 2:19 p.m.
Singapore time. Yesterday, the contract rose 73 cents to $77.67,
the highest settlement since May 5. Futures are down 2.9 percent
in 2010.  
 Oil climbed yesterday as motor fuels gained on signs of
higher consumption during the peak U.S. driving season from the
Memorial Day weekend in late May to Labor Day in early September.
Gasoline  demand  rose 1.6 percent to 9.34 million barrels a day,
the highest level since the week ended Aug. 28.  
 Gasoline stockpiles  fell  636,000 barrels to 218.3 million
in the week ended June 11, the lowest level this year, according
to the Energy Department. Analysts were split on whether
supplies gained or declined.  
 Refinery Runs  
 Refiners cut processing runs by 0.5 percent and capacity
utilization declined to 87.9 percent. The plants increased their
output of gasoline, contributing to the build in stockpiles.  
 “The gasoline simple yield jumped 2.1 percent to 62
percent which boosted production by 162,000 barrels a day
despite a reduction in refinery runs,”  Sung Yoo , an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a report yesterday.  
 Crude inventories gained as overall U.S. imports climbed
1.7 percent to 9.6 million barrels a day, the Energy Department
said. Supplies brought into the mid-continent  region  jumped to a
record 1.8 million barrels a day, the report showed.  
 Oil stockpiles rose to 363.1 million barrels last week.
Inventories at  Cushing , Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New
York crude futures, climbed by 194,000 barrels to 37.6 million.  
 Brent crude for August settlement fell as much as 45 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $77.69 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was at $77.89 at 2:20 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, the contract rose $1.04, or 1.4 percent, to end
the session at $78.14. The North Sea grade traded at a premium
of 86 cents to New York futures.  
 Inventories of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, increased 1.8 million barrels to 156.6
million, the highest since the week to Jan. 22. A 1 million-
barrel gain was forecast.
