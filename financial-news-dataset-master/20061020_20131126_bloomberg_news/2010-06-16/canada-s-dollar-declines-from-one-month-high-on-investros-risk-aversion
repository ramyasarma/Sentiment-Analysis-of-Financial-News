             Canada’s dollar erased an earlier
gain versus its U.S. counterpart as equities fell, making
growth-linked currencies less attractive.  
 The currency, known as the loonie, earlier rose as much as
0.7 percent after equities rebounded from the day’s lows and
Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  suggested economic
conditions require steadily increasing interest rates.  
 The Canadian currency traded at C$1.0246 per U.S. dollar at
4:36 p.m. in Toronto, matching yesterday’s C$1.0254 close, the
strongest since May 13. It earlier fell as much as 0.7 percent
and rose as much as 0.3 percent. One Canadian dollar buys 97.60
U.S. cents  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent, after an
earlier gain of 0.3 percent. Movements in Canada’s dollar are 89
percent correlated to the S&P 500 and 65 percent correlated to
crude oil, according to 30-day Bloomberg data. A correlation of
100 percent would mean they move in lockstep.  
 The central bank head said the uneven global recovery and
prospects of renewed weakness in Europe mean that future
increases in the central bank’s benchmark interest rate aren’t
“preordained.”  
 Carney “cautions that monetary policy is not preordained
but the economic conditions will continue to warrant small but
steady hiked in the Bank of Canada rate,”  David Semmens,  an
economist with Standard Chartered Bank in New York, said in an
e-mail. His remarks are “Canadian-dollar positive.  
 U.S. housing starts fell 10 percent, the biggest decline
since March 2009, to a 593,000 annual rate, Commerce Department
figures showed today in Washington. Economists forecast starts
would fall to a 648,000 annual rate, according to the median of
78 projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Russia may add the Australian and Canadian dollars to its
international reserves after fluctuations in the U.S. dollar and
euro. Russia’s international reserves, the world’s third
biggest, reached $458.2 billion on June 4.  
 “Adding the Australian dollar is being discussed,” Alexei
 Ulyukayev , the central bank’s first deputy chairman, said in an
interview at an event hosted by Bloomberg in Moscow yesterday.
“There are pros and cons. We have added the Canadian dollar but
haven’t yet begun operations” with the currency.  
 Canada auctioned C$3 billion of three-year bonds, drawing
an average yield of 2.393 percent. The 2.5 percent notes will
mature in September 2013, according to a statement on the Bank
of Canada’s Web site. The previous auction of three-year bonds
on May 12 fetched an average yield of 2.604 percent and had a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.219 times, according to Bank of Canada
data.  
 Canada’s 10-year government bond yield fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.36 percent. The 3.5
percent security due in June 2020 rose 49 cents to C$101.18.
