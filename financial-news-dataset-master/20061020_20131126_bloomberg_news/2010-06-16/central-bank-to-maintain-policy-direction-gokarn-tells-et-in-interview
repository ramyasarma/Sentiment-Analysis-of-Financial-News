             The Reserve Bank of India, which
raised benchmark interest rates twice this year to curb
inflation, will maintain the direction of its monetary policy,
the Economic Times reported, citing an interview with Deputy
Governor Subir Gokarn.  
 “The direction of the policy is very clear and it’s a
question of pacing,” Gokarn said, according to the report.
“The RBI does recognize the fact that the actions taken during
the crisis took our policy position far down the road and the
current level of policy instruments is not fully in alignment
with the state of the economy,” the newspaper cited Gokarn as
saying in the interview.
