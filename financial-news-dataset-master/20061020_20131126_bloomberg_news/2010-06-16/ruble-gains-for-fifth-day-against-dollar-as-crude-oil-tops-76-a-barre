             The ruble rose for a fifth day
against the dollar, extending its longest winning streak in more
than two months as oil, Russia’s main export earner, traded near
a one-month high.  
 The Russian currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 31.2450
per dollar at the close in Moscow, bringing its five-day gain to
1.9 percent. The yield on Russia’s benchmark dollar bonds due
April 2020 fell 4 basis points to 5.405 percent, the lowest
level since May 13.  
 Crude for July delivery traded at $76.90 a barrel in New
York, close to its highest closing level since May 6.  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.3294
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 31.4012
yesterday. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The ruble added 0.2 percent to 38.4000 per euro. The
movements against the dollar and the euro left the ruble at
34.4568, the strongest level since June 4, against the central
bank’s  target  currency basket, which is used to manage swings
that hurt Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
