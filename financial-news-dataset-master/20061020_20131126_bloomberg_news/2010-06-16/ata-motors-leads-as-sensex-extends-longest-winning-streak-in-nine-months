             India’s benchmark stock index
extended its longest string of gains in nine months as investors
bought shares in companies whose earnings are likely to rise.  
 Tata Motors Ltd. , the nation’s largest truckmaker, rose to
the highest in a month after global sales increased 50 percent
in May. Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the biggest copper
producer, gained for a third day as the metal’s price headed for
its longest rally in 11 months.  
 “Investors are picking up stocks that offer value,” said
 Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd., a New
Delhi-based brokerage. “Domestic consumption is very good story
for the Indian market.” Gupta advises investors to buy shares
in financial companies, banks and auto-makers, while declining
to name specific stocks.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 50.95, or 0.3 percent, to 17,463.78 at 11:03 a.m. in
Mumbai, advancing for a sixth day to its highest level since
April 30. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock Exchange
rose 0.3 percent to 5,235.15. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.3
percent to 2,211.59.  
 Tata Motors rose 2.7 percent to 780 rupees. Global sales,
including Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, gained 50 percent in
May to 79,819 units, the company said yesterday.  
 Sterlite Climbs  
 Sterlite  climbed 2.7 percent to 694.05 rupees, its highest
level in a month. Copper advanced for a seventh day, heading for
its longest winning streak since July 2009 on expectations
demand will strengthen with global economic growth.  
 India proposes imposing a capital gains tax on all stock
transactions by Indians and overseas funds, aimed at boosting
revenue and paring the budget shortfall from a 16-year high.
The draft on the new tax code and a paper for public discussion
was released in August last year, and the government yesterday
released a revised document, seeking comments from investors.  
 Fitch Ratings on June 14 cited India’s “strong prospects”
and the view the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio will be
reduced as the government collects higher-than-expected revenue
when it raised the local currency outlook to “stable” from
“negative.”  
 Gokaldas Exports Ltd. , a garment manufacturer 68 percent
owned by Blackstone Group LP, climbed 1.5 percent to 142.55
rupees. The company plans to start making suits and industrial
clothing as demand revives in the U.S., the company’s biggest
market. Gokaldas will spend 100 million rupees ($2.1 million)
this year to expand capacity, and expects the U.S. to account
for more than half of its sales in the year through March, said
Executive Director  Dinesh Hinduja .  
 Fund Inflows  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  3.81 billion rupees  ($81.7
million) of Indian equities June 14, increasing total purchases
of the stocks this year to 234.2 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd.  (GISP IN), a
construction company, jumped 5.7 percent to 27.65 rupees, poised
for its steepest climb since April 22, after saying it signed an
agreement to buy a company that is setting up a 250 megawatt
coal-based power plant in Western India.  
 KEC International Ltd.  (KECI IN), a maker of power
transmission equipment, climbed 2.1 percent to 473.90 rupees, on
course for its biggest gain in a month. The company expects to
match the industry’s revenue growth of 20 percent in two years,
Managing Director  Ramesh Chandak  said in an interview today.
