             Czech yields may rise at an auction
of 2024 koruna bonds as the government will probably sell more
debt than planned to meet record borrowing needs, Societe
Generale SA said in a report to clients today.  
 The Finance Ministry is offering 5 billion koruna ($240
million) of the security today to fund the budget deficit and
repay older debt. It plans to raise 280 billion koruna this
year, the largest amount on record.  
 “Since the ministry has secured only a minor share of its
total 2010 gross financing to date, it is pressured to sell as
much as possible,” analysts  Esther Law  in London and  Anne- Francoise Bluher  in Prague wrote in the report. The debt may be
“sold even cheaper than actually priced and a larger volume
than planned.”  
 The security traded at a yield of 4.641 percent today at
10:40 a.m. in Prague, its highest in a week. This compares with
the record-low yield of 4.332 at the previous offering of the
bond on April 21.  
 The first round of bidding ends at 12 p.m. local time.
