             European governments should aim not
only to reduce deficits but to balance budgets over the economic
cycle, Poland central bank Governor Marek Belka said in an
interview with the Financial Times.  
 Belka said European attempts to cut deficits to 3 percent
of gross domestic product are not ambitious enough, the FT
reported. Germany’s budgetary discipline is a good example to
the rest of Europe, he told the FT. Belka also said Poland
remains on track to join the euro, according to the report.
