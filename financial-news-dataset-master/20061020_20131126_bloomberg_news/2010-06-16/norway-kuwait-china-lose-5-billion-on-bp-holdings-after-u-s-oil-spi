             The governments of Norway, Kuwait,
China and Singapore have lost 3.4 billion pounds ($5 billion) on
BP Plc’s share slide since the Gulf of Mexico oil spill started
in April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 The sovereign wealth funds were four of the 12 largest
holders of BP’s London-traded shares at the start of May, the
data show.  Norway’s state fund  held 336 million shares, or 1.79
percent of the company, a stake that’s dropped 1.1 billion
pounds in value since the April 20 explosion aboard a rig in the
Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers. The Kuwait Investment
Authority held 328 million shares. The People’s Bank of China
had 1.1 percent of BP, the Government of Singapore 1.07 percent.  
 BP attracted investors last year after producing more oil
and gas than  Exxon Mobil Corp.  for the first time. The shares
gained 14 percent in 2009, more than Exxon or Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, its closest European rival. BP won plaudits for its ability
to discover new reserves. In September, it made the biggest U.S.
oil find in three years under the Gulf of Mexico.  
 “BP was the Goldman Sachs of the oil industry,” said
 Christine Tiscareno , an analyst at Standard & Poor’s in London.
“They were attractive because they had high dividends, were
winning environmental awards and had done so well with
exploration and production. If I were an investor, I would feel
this is an unfair situation.”  
 BP  shares  fell 3 to 342 pence yesterday in London, the
Lowest close since 1997. The stock has fallen 48 percent since
April 20, wiping about 60 billion pounds off the value of the
London-based company. The company dropped 2.3 pence, or 0.7
percent, to 339.7 pence at 10:06 a.m. local time.  
 Fund Managers  
 Among private fund managers, BlackRock Inc. is BP’s largest
shareholder with 1.1 billion shares, according to the latest
filing of Dec. 31. Legal & General Group Plc is the second-
largest, with a total of 751 million shares. The  12 top
investors  in BP held 4.72 billion shares as of May 4, or the
equivalent of 25 percent of BP, the data show.  
 BP may need to spend $40 billion to clean up the cost and
settle claims, London-based bank Standard Chartered Plc said
last week. The Obama Administration is pressing BP to set up an
escrow account for claims. Lawmakers are demanding BP defer
 dividends  until coastal businesses are compensated.  
 Kuwait Investment Authority isn’t considering selling its
stake in BP Plc, newspaper Al-Rai reported, without saying where
it got the information. No one was available to comment
yesterday. Norges Bank, which manages government investments,
doesn’t comment on individual holdings.  
 People’s Bank  
 The Government of Singapore Investment Corp. declined to
comment in an e-mailed response to questions. Calls to the
People’s Bank of China weren’t answered today, which is a public
holiday in China.  
 Steve Leach, a spokesman of Legal & General Group, declined
to comment. Alexandra Ring, a London-based spokeswoman of
BlackRock Inc. said the company doesn’t discuss individual
holdings.  Marc Hazelton , a London-based spokesman for Barclays,
couldn’t immediately comment when contacted over the phone.  
 Standard Life Investments, Capital Research & Management
and M&G Investment Management declined to comment. Insight
Investment Management didn’t immediately return phone calls for
comment.
