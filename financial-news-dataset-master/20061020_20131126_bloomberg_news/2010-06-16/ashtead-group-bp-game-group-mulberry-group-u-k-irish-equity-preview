             U.K. stocks  rose for a seventh day,
with the FTSE 100 Index heading for its longest streak of gains
since July 2009, after BP Plc agreed to cancel its dividend and
set up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims of the worst
spill in U.S. history.  
 BP  soared 7.5 percent.  Game Group Plc  dropped 5.7 percent
as the U.K.’s biggest electronic-games retailer said revenue
declined.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100  advanced 32.22, or 0.6 percent, to
5,270.14 at 2:40 p.m. in London. The FTSE 100 remains 49 percent
higher than in March 2009 amid signs the global economy is
recovering. Still, the gauge has fallen 9.4 percent from this
year’s high on April 15 on concern that Europe’s debt crisis
will hurt the economic recovery and as BP lost more than a third
of its value following the oil spill. The  FTSE All-Share Index 
rose 0.6 percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  climbed 0.2 percent
today.  
 “The setting up of a $20 billion claims response fund and
a cut in the dividend has clarified two of the most important
issues which have been overhanging the shares” of BP,  Gordon Gray , a London-based analyst at Collins Stewart, wrote in a
report today, recommending that investors buy the shares.  
 BP climbed 7.5 percent to 362.3 pence. The London-based
slashed its $10 billion-a-year dividend and agreed to create an
escrow fund to pay damages from Gulf of Mexico spill following a
meeting between Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  and U.S. President
 Barack Obama  yesterday.  
 Game Group  sank 5.8 percent to 83.1 pence. The retailer
said sales at stores open at least a year fell 12 percent in the
19 weeks ended June 12.  
 WS Atkins Plc declined 4.1 percent to 696 pence after
saying full-year revenue fell to 1.39 billion pounds.  
 Bodycote Plc climbed 3.8 percent to 203.9 pence as
Arbuthnot Securities Ltd. upgraded the shares to “buy” from
“neutral.”
