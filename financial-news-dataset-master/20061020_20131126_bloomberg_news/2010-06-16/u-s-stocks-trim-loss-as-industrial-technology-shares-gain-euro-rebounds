             U.S. stocks trimmed losses as shares
of industrial and technology companies advanced and the euro
erased declines after falling as much as 0.6 percent against the
dollar.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
1,113.69 at 11:22 a.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 0.7
percent earlier. The gauge rallied 2.4 percent yesterday and
closed above its 200-day average for the first time in almost a
month, a bullish sign to investors who make trading decisions
based on chart patterns. The euro was little changed at $1.2332.
