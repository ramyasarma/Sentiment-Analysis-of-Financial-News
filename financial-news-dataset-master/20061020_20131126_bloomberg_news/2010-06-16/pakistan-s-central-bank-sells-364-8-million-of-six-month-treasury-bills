             Pakistan’s central bank sold 31.2
billion rupees ($364.8 million) of benchmark six-month treasury
bills in an auction today at yields higher than in the previous
sale.  
 The State Bank of Pakistan offered the notes at 12.3
percent, compared with a rate of 12.24 percent in the previous
auction on June 2, according to a statement by the Karachi-based
central bank today. It also sold 21.6 billion rupees of three-
month bills at 12.1 percent, from 12.01 percent and 62.6 billion
rupees of one-year paper at 12.4 percent, compared with 12.34
percent in the previous sale.  
 The central bank will probably sell the three-month, six-
month and one-year treasury bills at yields of 12.07 percent,
12.29 percent and 12.39 percent, according to the median results
of a survey by Bloomberg News.  
 The central bank received offers worth 149.3 billion
