             Mexico’s peso dropped as builders in
the U.S., the nation’s largest trading partner, started building
fewer homes in May than forecast, fueling speculation the global
economic recovery may be slowing down.  
 The peso fell 0.5 percent to 12.6350 per dollar at 8:58
a.m. New York time, from 12.5763 yesterday. The loss pared the
peso’s gain this year to 3.5 percent, the best performance among
the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 The housing data “is definitely adding to peso weakness,”
said  Dirk Willer , head of Latin American local markets strategy
at Citigroup Inc. in New York.  
 Housing starts fell 10 percent, the biggest decline since
March 2009, the Commerce Department in Washington said today.
The U.S. buys about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 was
little changed at 7.23 percent, according to Banco Santander SA.
