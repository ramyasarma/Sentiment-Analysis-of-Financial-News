             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s largest shipyard, said it won a $1.6 billion order from
Dhuruma Electricity Co. to build a power plant in Saudi Arabia,
its biggest contract in eight months.  
 Hyundai Heavy will build a 1,729-megawatt power plant in
Dhuruma, 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of Riyadh by March 2013,
the Ulsan, South Korea-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. The shipyard won a record $2.06 billion order
in October to build processing facilities for Chevron Corp.’s
Gorgon project in Australia.  
 South Korean companies may win a record $70 billion in
overseas orders this year, according to government estimates,
helped by demand from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the Arab
world’s biggest economy, plans to increase generating capacity
as its population grows and industrial demand for power rises.  
 Hyundai Heavy  gained as much as 2.7 percent to 231,500 won
and traded at 229,000 won as of 11:37 a.m. in Seoul. The stock
has advanced 32 percent this year, outperforming a 1.1 percent
rise in South Korea’s Kospi index.  
 Saudi Arabia plans to spend $80 billion to raise its
capacity and transmission network in the next decade as demand
increases to 65,000 megawatts in 2018.
