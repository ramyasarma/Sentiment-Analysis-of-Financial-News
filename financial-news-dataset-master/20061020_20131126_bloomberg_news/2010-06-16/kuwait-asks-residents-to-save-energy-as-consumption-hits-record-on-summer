             Kuwait’s government urged residents
to conserve energy as summer temperatures rose and power
consumption reached a record, the state news agency  KUNA 
reported, citing cabinet ministers.  
 The ministry of electricity and water’s consumption gauge
rose to a record 10,921 megawatts yesterday, according to the
ministry’s  website . The maximum temperature recorded at Kuwait
International Airport was 50.7 degrees Celsius, and in desert
areas temperatures rose above 53 degrees, according to the
 website  of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.  
 “The electricity consumption gauge recording at peak time
yesterday was extremely dangerous,” Roudhan al-Roudhan, the
state minister for cabinet affairs, told KUNA. Excessive use of
electricity should be avoided, he said.  
 Power cuts in some areas were due to “strains on power
transformers and the technicians operating them,” KUNA cited
Bader al-Shruaian, the electricity and water minister, as
saying. The government hopes “programmed blackouts” will be
unnecessary, al-Shruaian said.  
 Lawmakers requested an extraordinary session on June 20 to
discuss the electricity situation.
