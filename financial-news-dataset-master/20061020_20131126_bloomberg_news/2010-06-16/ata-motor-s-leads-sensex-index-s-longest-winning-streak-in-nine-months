             India’s benchmark stock index
completed its longest string of gains in nine months as
investors bought shares in companies whose earnings are likely
to rise.  
 Tata Motors Ltd. , the nation’s largest truckmaker, rose to
the highest level in a month after global sales increased 50
percent in May. Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the biggest
copper producer, gained for a third day as the metal’s price
headed for its longest rally in 11 months.  
 “Investors are picking up stocks that offer value,” said
 Avinash Gupta , an analyst at Bonanza Portfolio Ltd., a New
Delhi-based brokerage. “Domestic consumption is a very good
story for the Indian market.” Gupta advises investors to buy
shares in financial companies, banks and automakers, while
declining to name specific stocks.  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 50.04, or 0.3 percent, to 17,462.8, advancing for a sixth
day to its highest level since April 30. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index
on the National Stock Exchange rose 0.2 percent to 5,233.35. The
 BSE 200 Index  increased 0.1 percent to 2,207.29.  
 Tata Motors increased 2.7 percent to 780.35 rupees. Global
sales, including Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, gained 50
percent in May to 79,819 units, the company said yesterday.  
 Sterlite Climbs  
 Sterlite  climbed 2.1 percent to 689.85 rupees, its highest
level in a month. Copper advanced for a seventh day, heading for
its longest winning streak since July 2009 on expectations
demand will strengthen with global economic growth.  
 India proposes imposing a capital gains tax on all stock
transactions by Indians and overseas funds, aimed at boosting
revenue and paring the budget shortfall from a 16-year high. The
draft on the new tax code and a paper for public discussion was
released in August last year, and the government yesterday
released a revised document, seeking comments from investors.  
 Fitch Ratings on June 14 cited India’s “strong prospects”
and the view the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio will be
reduced as the government collects higher-than-expected revenue
when it raised the local currency outlook to “stable” from
“negative.”  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  3.81 billion rupees  ($81.7
million) of Indian equities June 14, increasing total purchases
of the stocks this year to 234.2 billion rupees, according to
the nation’s market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
 Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd.  (GISP IN), a
construction company, jumped 6.1 percent to 27.75 rupees, its
biggest gain in almost two months, after saying it signed an
agreement to buy a company that’s setting up a 250 megawatt
coal-based power plant in Western India.  
 Gokaldas Exports Ltd. , (GEXP IN), a garment manufacturer 68
percent owned by Blackstone Group LP, climbed 5.3 percent to 148
rupees, its steepest advance in two months. Gokaldas will spend
100 million rupees ($2.1 million) this year to expand capacity,
and expects the U.S. to account for more than half of its sales
in the year through March, said Executive Director  Dinesh Hinduja .  
 Punj Lloyd Ltd.  (PUNJ IN), a construction company, rose 3.9
percent to 125.9 rupees, its biggest gain since Feb. 16, after a
unit got an order from Resorts World at Sentosa Pte to build the
last phase of the Singapore leisure property for S$419 million
($300 million).  
 Vivimed Labs Ltd.  (VILA IN), a maker of chemicals and drugs,
rose 2.1 percent to 170.15 rupees after signing a manufacturing

Specialty Products Inc. for sun protective sprays and lotions.
