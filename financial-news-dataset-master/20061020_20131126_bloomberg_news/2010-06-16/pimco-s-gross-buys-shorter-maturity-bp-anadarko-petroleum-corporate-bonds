             Bill Gross , co-chief investment
officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., recently bought
$100 million of shorter maturity BP Plc bonds and some Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. debt, spokesman  Mark Porterfield  wrote today in
an e-mail.  
 BP’s 5.25 percent notes due in 2013 rose 2.5 cents to 93.5
cents on the dollar as of 4:20 p.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. BP is based in London.  
 The debt fell as low as 87 cents on the dollar earlier
today and has declined from a high this year of 110.8 cents,
according to Trace data.  
 Gross, manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, also
purchased 6- to 12-month Anadarko debt, Porterfield wrote. The
Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko’s 6.75 percent notes due in 2011
rose 0.5 cent to 98 cents, Trace data show. In earlier trading
the securities declined to 96.5 cents, the lowest ever, and down
from 106.25 cents on Dec. 31.  
 Reuters and CNBC earlier reported the bond purchases by
Newport Beach, California-based Pimco.  
 The worst oil spill in U.S. history began April 20 after an
explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP.  Anadarko 
owns 25 percent of the well in the Gulf of Mexico that is
spewing the oil.
