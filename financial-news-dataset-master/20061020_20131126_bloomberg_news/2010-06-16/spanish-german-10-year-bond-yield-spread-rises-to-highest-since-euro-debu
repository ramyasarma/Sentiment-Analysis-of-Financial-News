             The yield premium investors demand
to hold Spanish 10-year government bonds instead of German bunds
rose to a euro-era record after newspaper El Economista reported
that the International Monetary Fund, the EU and the U.S.
Treasury are putting together a credit line of as much as 250
billion euros for Spain.  
 The difference in yield, or spread, between the securities
widened to 216 basis points at 9:52 a.m. in Madrid. That’s the
most since 1997, according to Bloomberg generic data. The
Spanish government and the European Commission denied the report
in El Economista.
