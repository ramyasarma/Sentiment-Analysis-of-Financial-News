             Japanese  stocks  rose for a fifth day
as growth in New York manufacturing, higher sales forecast for
semiconductors and rising commodity prices boosted optimism a
recovery in the global economy will boost corporate earnings.  
 Canon Inc. , which gets 27 percent of its sales from the
Americas, jumped 3.9 percent.  Advantest Corp. , the world’s
largest maker of memory-chip testers, gained 2.5 percent after
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s projection for global
demand boosted U.S. chip shares.  Mitsubishi Corp. , a trading
company that gets 41 percent of its sales from commodities,
climbed 2.3 percent after prices for oil and metals rose
yesterday.  
 The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  increased 1.8 percent to close
at 10,067.15 in Tokyo. The broader  Topix index  rose 1.5 percent
to 892.38 with all but one of its 33 industry groups gaining.
Both gauges climbed for a fifth day, the longest streak of
advances in at least five months.  
 “The continuing improvement in earnings will drive down
valuations even further, so there is little concern that the
market will decline,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , a fund manager at
Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees about $6 billion in
Tokyo. “We are bullish on the U.S. economy.”  
 The Topix advanced less than 0.1 percent yesterday as
analysts’ ratings boosted shares of brokerages and automakers,
outshining a credit-rating downgrade on Greece by Moody’s
Investors Service. The gauge has fallen 11 percent from a 52-
week high on April 15 on concern mounting government deficits
will deter some European nations from shoring up their economies
through spending.  
 The slump has driven down the  average  price of shares in
the Topix to 17.2 times estimated earnings, compared with 35.6
times at the beginning of this year.
