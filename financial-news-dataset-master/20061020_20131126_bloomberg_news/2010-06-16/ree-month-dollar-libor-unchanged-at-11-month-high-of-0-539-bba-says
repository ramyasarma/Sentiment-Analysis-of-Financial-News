             The rate that banks say they borrow
from each other for three months in dollars was unchanged,
according to the British Bankers’ Association.  
 The London Interbank Offer Rate, or Libor, for such loans
was at 0.539 percent, equalling the highest level since July 6,
the BBA said.  
 The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was little changed at 31.94 basis points as of 11:39
a.m. in London.
