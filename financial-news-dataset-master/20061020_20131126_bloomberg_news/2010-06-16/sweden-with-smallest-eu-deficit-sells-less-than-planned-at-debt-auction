             Sweden sold 325 million kronor
($41.66 million) less than planned at a government debt auction
today, the country’s debt office said.  
 The government sold 675 million kronor of 3.5 percent 2039
bonds, compared with the 1 billion kronor originally planned,
the debt office said in a statement today. The average yield was
3.190 percent.  
 “This is far lower than usual and odd considering Sweden’s
strong debt position,” IDEAGlobal said in a note to clients
today. “As such, it is probably an anomaly.”  
 Sweden boasts the European Union’s smallest deficit to
gross domestic product ratio at 0.5 percent in 2009, the
European Commission said on May 5. The shortfall will widen to
2.1 percent this year, the commission estimates.
