             Telemar Norte Leste SA , Brazil’s
biggest fixed-line phone company, tumbled the most since
December 2008 in Sao Paulo trading after  Brasil Telecom SA 
minority shareholders rejected the price in a share-swap offer.  
 Telemar, known as Oi, slid 6.4 percent to 52 reais.  
 Investors turned down the deal after Oi, which bought
control of Brasil Telecom last year, cut the proposed swap ratio
by about 21 percent, saying its rival had higher-than-estimated
legal liabilities. The failure of the offer limits Oi’s savings
following the takeover, said  Maria Tereza Azevedo , an analyst at
Link Corretora.  
 “They aren’t big costs, but some synergies can’t be
captured,” Azevedo, who rates Oi “outperform,” said by phone
from Sao Paulo. “Oi might propose a new share swap. The most
likely outcome is that they don’t incorporate and remain two
separate companies. I don’t see it as too harmful for Oi.”  
 Telemar parent  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA  lost 4.6
percent to 28.66 reais, while Brasil Telecom dropped 3.5 percent
to 12.06 reais.
