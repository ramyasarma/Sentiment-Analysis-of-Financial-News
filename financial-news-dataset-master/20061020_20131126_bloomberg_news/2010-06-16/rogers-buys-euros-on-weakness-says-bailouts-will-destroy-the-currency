             Jim Rogers , chairman of Rogers
Holdings, said he is buying euros even as he predicts that
bailouts for European nations will eventually destroy their
single currency.  
 The Singapore-based investor, who predicted the start of
the global commodities rally in 1999, said he bought euros this
week and may acquire more because investor sentiment has turned
too negative in the short term. It will take 10 to 15 years for
the currency to disappear, he said in an interview in Madrid.  
 “It’s time to go in and take the other side,” Rogers said
today. “It got beaten down so much.”  
 The euro fell almost 11 percent against the dollar in the
last three months as European Union nations struggled to contain
budget deficits more than triple the bloc’s 3 percent limit.
Last month the EU announced a 750 billion-euro ($923 billion)
rescue mechanism to stem contagion from Greece as the risk
premium on Spanish and Portuguese bonds surged.  
 “That’s not the way it’s supposed to work,” Rogers said
at the Rafael Del Pino Foundation in the Spanish capital. “I
don’t think it’s good for Europe, and I don’t think it’s good
for the world to bail out people who have failed.”  
 The euro was down 0.1 percent to $1.2298 as of 11:38 p.m.
in Madrid.  
 The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
government bonds rather than the benchmark German bunds touched
a euro-era record today of 2.22 percentage points on an intraday
basis after Spain’s El Economista newspaper said the
International Monetary Fund is coordinating a 250 billion-euro
credit line for the country. The EU and IMF denied the report.  
 ‘Long on Euro’  
 Rogers, who co-founded the Quantum Hedge Fund with  George Soros  in 1970, said the process of undermining the euro is a
long one.  
 “Debasing what has been a strong currency and making it
weaker and weaker is in the end going to destroy the euro,”
Rogers said. “In the interim, I’m long the euro.”  
 Separately, the 67-year-old investor said BP Plc is too
“crippled” by its costs in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill for
its stock to be attractive, though he doesn’t rule out a future
purchase.  
 “Is it the end of BP? I doubt it,” Rogers said.
“Somewhere along the line I expect that I will buy BP. But I’m
not buying it now -- just watching to see what happens.”
