             Switzerland’s lower house of
parliament voted to open the  UBS AG  tax agreement with the U.S.
to a possible referendum, holding up approval until differences
with the upper house are resolved.  
 The lower chamber’s ballot, by 94 votes to 77 with 14
abstentions, means the deal will now be submitted to a conflict-
resolution panel with a final round of voting in both houses of
parliament by Friday.  
 Switzerland agreed in August 2009 to hand over data on as
many as 4,450 UBS clients suspected of tax dodging to the
Internal Revenue Service. Parliamentary approval became
necessary after a court ruled on Jan. 21 that the agreement
couldn’t be enforced as it then stood. If a referendum is
ultimately held, a deadline for disclosure of the information
may be missed.  
 “If Parliament ultimately fails to approve the treaty, the
U.S. could swiftly start taking measures,” Justice Minister
 Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf  told Bloomberg after the debate. “It
would have negative consequences for Swiss companies and for
U.S. companies investing in Switzerland.”  
 While both houses of the Swiss legislature have approved
the UBS deal in principle, the upper house has rejected a
nationwide vote and the lower house continues to insist on it
being allowed.  
 A panel composed of 26 members from both houses will now
propose a compromise. If no common ground can be found, the
agreement will fail.
