             Take in an al fresco witch hunt as
you set off on your summer weekend in London.  
 “ The Crucible ” --  Arthur Miller’s  ‘50s parable about the
Salem “witch trials” of innocent young women in 1692
Massachusetts -- has its closing weekend at the  open-air theater 
in Regent’s Park. Britain’s oldest permanent outdoor stage hosts
performances for 16 weeks each summer, drawing more than 130,000
people.  
 The forest-like surroundings add to the ominous feel of the
play, which is staged by Timothy Sheader and features Oliver
Ford Davies as Danforth, the deputy governor.  
 Open Air Theatre is at the Ironworks, Inner Circle,
Regent’s Park, London NW1 4NR, and runs through Sept. 11.
Information:  http://openairtheatre.org  or +44-844-826-4242.  
 Iberica, on Portland Place near the park, is popular with
the Spanish community for its excellent tapas and wines. You can
also buy meats and cheeses to take for a picnic. Information:

 Saturday  
 Hear  Wynton Marsalis   play  for free at Victoria Park in East
London.  
 The trumpeter and his  Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra 
bring Latin swing and big-band sound to the park. It’s the 15-
member ensemble’s first-ever open-air concert in the U.K.  
 Marsalis and his cohorts play at 5 p.m., in between other
acts, at Victoria Park, Grove Road, E3. Information:
 http://www.paradisegardensfestival.org.uk  or +44-20-7264-7925.  
 If you want to pay to hear Marsalis and his big band,
they’re at the  Barbican  Friday and the  Hackney Empire  Sunday.
Information:  http://www.barbican.org  or +44-20-7638-4141.  
 Saturday Night  
 Green Day makes a return visit to London on its world tour.
The trio is perfecting its “American Idiot” sneer after more
than two decades and 65 million records sold.  
 Expect hits from the incendiary “21st Century Breakdown”
to the rabble rousing “Minority.”  
 Green Day, Wembley National Stadium, HA9 0WS. Information:
+44-844-980-8001,  http://www.greenday.com  or

 Sunday  
 See  Charles Saatchi’s  pick of today’s young British artists
at his sprawling gallery in Chelsea.  
 “Newspeak: British Art Now -- Part I” is the biggest
exhibition to be held at the new  Saatchi Gallery  since it opened
in October 2008 off King’s Road. The show rounds up work from
several dozen upstarts, many of them little known. But so were
 Damien Hirst  and  Tracey Emin  once upon a time.  
 An established name in the mix is  Goshka Macuga , a 2008
Turner Prize nominee who, at the  Whitechapel  Gallery last year,
recreated the  United Nations  Security Council’s circular chamber
and arranged for the loan of the tapestry of Picasso’s
“Guernica” that usually hangs at the UN in New York.
Brilliant!
