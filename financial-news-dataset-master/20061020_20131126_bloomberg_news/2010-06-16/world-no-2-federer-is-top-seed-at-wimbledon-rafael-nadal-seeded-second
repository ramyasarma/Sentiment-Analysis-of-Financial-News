              World No. 2  Roger Federer  was named
top seed at next week’s Wimbledon tennis championships while
top-ranked  Rafael Nadal  was seeded second by the All England
Club.  
 Defending champion Federer of Switzerland is seeking his
seventh title at  Wimbledon , which starts June 21 on the grass
courts of the All England Club. Nadal, who won his lone
Wimbledon championship two years ago by beating Federer, was
unable to defend his title last year because of tendinitis in
both knees.  
 Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam event where seedings can
differ from a player’s ranking. Organizers take into account a
player’s performance on grass in the previous two years.  
 Spain’s Nadal regained the top spot on the ATP World Tour
from Federer on June 7, a day after he won his fifth French Open
championship in Paris. His return to the No. 1 spot in men’s
tennis prevented Federer from surpassing  Pete Sampras ’s record
of 286 weeks at the top. Federer has been No. 1 for 285 weeks.  
 Serbia’s  Novak Djokovic  was seeded third for Wimbledon,
while  Andy Murray  of Britain was seeded fourth.  Andy Roddick  of
the U.S., last year’s losing finalist, was named the No. 5 seed.  
 The women’s seedings follow the WTA Tour singles rankings
list, the All England Club said. Top-ranked  Serena Williams , the
defending champion, is the top seed ahead of her sister Venus.
Denmark’s Caroline Wozniacki is the No. 3 seed, followed by
Jelena Jankovic of Serbia at No. 4.  
 French Open champion and sixth-ranked  Francesca Schiavone 
of Italy was named fifth seed after world No. 5 and Olympic
champion Elena Dementieva of Russia pulled out with a calf
injury.
