             The U.K. should cut the amount of
alcohol drivers are allowed in their bloodstream by more than a
third, according to a government review.  
 The Labour government, which lost power in May, asked
lawyer Peter North to study whether the rules should change. He
submitted his findings to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
coalition last month. The document, released by the government
today, urges a reduction in the blood alcohol limit to 50
milligrams per 100 milliliters from 80mg per 100ml. That would
bring it into line with much of Europe.  
 “With a blood alcohol level between my proposed new limit
of 50mg/100ml and the current 80mg/100ml limit, a driver has a
six times greater risk of road death than a non-drinking
driver,” North said in an e-mailed statement. “The public is
ready for a lower limit. It is time to give them what they
want.”  
 North said such a move might save as many as 168 lives in
its first year. In 2008 there were 430 drink-driving deaths in
Britain. North also said he wants rule changes to make it easier
to catch and prosecute those driving under the influence of
drugs.
