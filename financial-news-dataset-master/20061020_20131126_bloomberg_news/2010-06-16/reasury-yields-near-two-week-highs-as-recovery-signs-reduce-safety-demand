             Treasury 10-year notes rose for the
first day this week on speculation the economic recovery is yet
to take hold and Europe’s debt crisis hasn’t been contained.  
 The gain sent the 10-year yield down from near the highest
in 10 days. The Commerce Department will say today that work on
new houses slowed last month, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Spain, the International Monetary Fund and the European
Commission dismissed claims published in newspaper El Economista
that the country is set to receive a 250 billion-euro ($307
billion) credit line, Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said.  
 “Treasuries are driven by swings in sentiment,” said
 Orlando Green , an interest-rates strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “There’s still doubt
over the economic recovery, which remains fragile. There are
still concerns over Spain. This uncertainty creates an
environment which benefits good-quality bonds.”  
 The yield on the 10-year note fell one basis point to 3.30
percent as of 6:54 a.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market Data. It reached 3.32 percent on each of the past four
trading days, the highest level since June 4. The 3.5 percent
security maturing in May 2020 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000
face amount, to 101 23/32.  
 Treasuries pared earlier gains as the Stoxx Europe 600
 Index  advanced for the sixth straight day.  
 Market turmoil stemming from the euro-region’s sovereign
debt crisis has increased demand for the relative safety of U.S.
government bonds. The 10-year note yield fell to 3.06 percent on
May 25, the lowest since April 2009.  
 Spanish Premium  
 The  yield premium  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
government bonds instead of German bunds rose to a euro-era
record, widening to 217 basis points. That’s the most since
1997, according to Bloomberg generic data.  
 Work began on 648,000 houses at an  annual pace  last month,
down from a 672,000 rate in April, according to the median
forecast of 78 economists surveyed before an 8:30 a.m. report
from the Commerce Department in Washington.  
 Treasuries fell earlier, extending yesterday’s decline
after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erased its loss for the
year.  
 Fed officials may trim forecasts for economic growth when
they meet next week as Europe’s debt crisis saps demand for
American goods and roils financial markets.  
 Estimate Reductions  
 Central bankers may reduce their 2010 estimates by
“several tenths” of a percentage point and as much as 0.75
point for 2011, former Fed Governor  Lyle Gramley  said. That
would mark a reversal from April, when officials raised their
projections for this year to a range of 3.2 percent to 3.7
percent and left 2011 and 2012 forecasts little changed.  
 The new estimates are likely to reinforce the Fed’s pledge,
in place since March 2009, that interest rates will stay low for
an “extended period,” said former Fed researcher  John Ryding .  
 The Federal Open Market Committee meets in Washington on
June 22-23. The U.S. central bank lowered its Fed Funds  target
rate  to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 to
reduce borrowing costs and help stimulate the economy.  
 “The Fed is apparently in no hurry to normalize interest
rates,” said  Koichi Kurose , chief strategist at Resona Bank
Ltd, a unit of Japan’s fourth-largest banking group in Tokyo.
“This rate outlook will help Treasury yields to stay low.”  
 Futures on the CME Group Inc. exchange show a 28 percent
chance the Fed will raise its benchmark rate by at least a
quarter-percentage point by its December meeting, down from 40
percent odds a month earlier.  
 Treasuries have returned 4.2 percent since the start of the
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds have returned 6.5 percent, while Spanish securities
declined 3.6 percent, the indexes showed.
