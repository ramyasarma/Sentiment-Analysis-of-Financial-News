             Kobe Bryant  scored 26 points and the
Los Angeles Lakers got a spark from their bench in an 89-67
defeat of the Boston Celtics that tied the NBA Finals at three
games apiece, forcing a decisive Game 7.  
 The Lakers, facing elimination if they lost, led by 10
points after the first quarter, by 20 at halftime and by 25 at
the end of the third quarter last night in Los Angeles.  
 After a six-month National Basketball Association regular
season, two months of playoffs and six games in the Finals, the
NBA championship will come down to one game tomorrow in Los
Angeles.  
 “We have to come with the same energy, the same dedication
to the defensive end,” Bryant said of Game 7 in an on-court
televised interview.  
 The Lakers outrebounded the Celtics 52-39 last night, and
the Los Angeles bench outscored Boston’s substitutes 25-13 -- a
sharp contrast to the Celtics’ win in Game 4 in which their
bench outscored the Lakers’ 36-18.  
 “Our defense was good, our rebounding was better,” Los
Angeles coach  Phil Jackson , who is trying to win his 11th NBA
title, said in a news conference.  
 Pau Gasol  had 17 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for
the Lakers.  Sasha Vujacic  had nine points and  Lamar Odom  had
eight off the bench for Los Angeles.  
 Ray Allen  had 19 points to lead Boston, which shot 33
percent from the field.  
 “I thought we’d play better,” Boston coach  Doc Rivers 
said in a news conference. “The Lakers played harder, better.”  
 Both teams lost their starting centers to injury last
night, and their availability was unclear for Game 7. Boston’s
 Kendrick Perkins  left the game in the first quarter with a right
knee injury. The Lakers’  Andrew Bynum , who has struggled with
leg problems throughout the playoffs, was limited to 16 minutes.  
 “He’s one of our guys who gives us great spirit,” Rivers
said of Perkins. “I hope he can play. It’s going to be tough if
he can’t.”
