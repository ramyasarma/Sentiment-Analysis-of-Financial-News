             EasyJet Plc founder Stelios Haji-
Ioannou told a London court that the airline is in danger of
sullying the “Easy” brand by squeezing revenue from extras
such as food sales and car rentals.  
 Ticket sales are the only core airline activity under a
licensing agreement, said Stelios, who prefers to be known by
his first name, adding that EasyJet resorted to other activities
that aren’t covered after over-expansion damaged profitability.  
 The company was “gouging the customer with useless
services” as a “short term response” to increase revenue,
Stelios said in a written statement submitted to the court.  
 EasyJet, Europe’s second-largest discount carrier behind
 Ryanair Holdings Plc , signed a brand license agreement with the
EasyGroup holding company in November 2000, shortly before its
initial offering of shares to investors. The contract said the
Luton, England-based airline must derive at least 75 percent of
its sales from airline operations.  
 Stelios is suing the airline over the services that can be
offered under the “Easy” and “EasyJet” name. A lawyer for
Stelios’s EasyGroup this week said that the dispute hinges on
the difference between “core” and “ancillary” airline
services.  
 Stelios said that the growth of EasyJet over the last
decade has damaged profitability, leading the airline to
“squeeze whatever revenue it can from its customers regardless
of the potential adverse impact this can have on the way
customers relate to the ‘Easy’ and EasyJet brands.”  
 EasyJet had a profit margin of 1.6 percent in its last
financial year, Stelios said. “This contrasts with the position
in the first year following the IPO” when EasyJet had an 11.2
percent margin, he said.  
 ‘Inexplicable Optimism’  
 “I cannot be sure what the reason is” for the EasyJet
management’s “inexplicable optimism that the company should
continue to push for fleet growth in spite of poor economic
returns and market changes,” Stelios said. “What I do know is
what the results of this strategy have been and what it is
likely to lead to.”  
 The sale of services such as food, travel insurance and car
hire at the passengers’ destinations aren’t integral to the
airline’s business, Stelios’s EasyGroup said in court papers.
EasyJet said those services, along with luggage and priority
boarding fees, are part of its main business.  
 Stelios resigned from EasyJet’s board May 14 after failing
to persuade its management team to rein in expansion plans and
start paying dividends. The entrepreneur, who set up EasyJet in
1995, owns about 38 percent of the shares.  
 In-Flight Food  
 The carrier has argued that services are integral to its
business and items only have value when sold in connection with
a plane ticket. EasyJet made 238 million pounds ($351 million)
from baggage fees in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and said it
wants to increase revenue with better in-flight food offerings.  
 The carrier said in court documents that EasyGroup vetoed
participation in supermarket chain  J Sainsbury Plc ’s loyalty-
card program and leases for two or three aircrafts and crew.  
 The case is: EasyGroup IP Licensing Ltd. vs. EasyJet
Airline Company Ltd., No. HC 08 C02329, U.K. High Court.
