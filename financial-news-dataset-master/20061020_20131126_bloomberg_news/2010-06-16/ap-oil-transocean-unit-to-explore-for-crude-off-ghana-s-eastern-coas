             Ghana, the West African nation set
to begin production of oil for export in the fourth quarter of
this year, will start exploring its eastern coast for crude,
companies leading the exploration said.  
 Australia’s  Tap Oil Ltd.  has a 36-percent stake in the
exploration deal, the companies said in a statement handed to
reporters yesterday. The area, called the  Keta Basin , stretches
east of the capital city, Accra, toward the border with
neighboring Togo in the area.  
 Closely-held U.S. explorer Afex International has 27
percent, Challenger Minerals Inc., a unit of  Transocean Ltd. 
also holds 27 percent and state oil company Ghana National
Petroleum Corp. owns 10 percent, according to the statement.  
 The companies will acquire seismic data on the area and
drill a single exploration well within the next 2 1/2 years, the
statement said.  
 Ghana’s Jubilee oilfield, which has potential resources of
1.8 billion barrels according to field operator  Tullow Oil Plc ,
is off the western coast, near the border with Ivory Coast.
