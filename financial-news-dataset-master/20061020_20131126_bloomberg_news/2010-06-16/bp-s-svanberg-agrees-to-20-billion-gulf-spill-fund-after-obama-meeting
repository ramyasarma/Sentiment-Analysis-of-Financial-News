             BP Plc  Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg 
agreed to provide $20 billion to pay “all proper claims” from
the Gulf of Mexico oil spill after what he called a constructive
meeting with President Barack Obama.  
 “He’s frustrated, because he cares about the small people,
and we care about the small people,” Svanberg said today after
the White House meeting. “I hear comments sometimes that large
oil companies are greedy companies that don’t care. That is not
the case in BP. We care about the small people.”  
 Svanberg spoke after meeting Obama and his senior advisers
to hammer out the plan for compensating Gulf Coast residents and
businesses affect by the oil spill from a damaged BP well. The
chairman apologized for the oil spill, which he called an
accident that shouldn’t have happened.  
 He was accompanied by Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward ,
Lamar McKay</a>, president of BP America Inc.,  Robert Dudley , BP
managing director, and company lawyers.  
 Along with Obama and Vice President  Joe Biden ,
administration officials in the meeting included Attorney
General  Eric Holder , Energy Secretary  Steven Chu , chief of staff
 Rahm Emanuel ,  Lawrence Summers , head of the National Economic
Council,  Bob Bauer , chief lawyer to the president, and  Carol Browner , the president’s adviser on energy and climate change.
