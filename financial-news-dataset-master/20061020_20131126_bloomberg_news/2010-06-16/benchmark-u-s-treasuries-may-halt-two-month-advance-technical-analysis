             Treasury  10-year notes may halt two
months of gains should yields rise above 3.48 percent, National
Australia Bank Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  
 “That’s the mid-point of a consolidation and if it gets
violated back to the upside in the case of 10-year yields, it
would suggest that the downward move is probably in trouble,”
said  Gordon Manning , a technical analyst at Australia’s fourth-
largest bank. A break means “we would enter a very choppy
period” with the chance of sudden increases in yields, he said.  
 A failure to advance above 3.48 percent may signal a
decline to 3.03 percent and 2.81 percent, Manning said. A
Fibonacci  graph  shows the level of 3.02 percent is a 50 percent
retracement of an increase in yields that started from a record
low on December 2008 and ended on April 5.  
 The benchmark 10-year note yielded 3.30 percent as of
12:42 p.m. in Tokyo, little changed from yesterday and from
3.29 percent on May 31. Ten-year debt returned 3.2 percent in
May as yields sank as low as 3.06 percent, the least since
April 2009, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
They rose 1.7 percent the previous month.  
 Fibonacci  analysis is based on a formula developed by 13th
century mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who
discovered the sequence while studying the reproduction rate of
rabbits. Analysts use the indicator to determine levels where
buy and sell orders may be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
