             U.S. corporations that gave stock
options to executives claimed tax deductions in 2008 that were
$52 billion higher than the costs they reported to shareholders,
a U.S. senator said.  
 Michigan Senator  Carl Levin , who has been trying to pass
legislation to limit tax deductions for stock options since
1997, said the difference between the deductions and expenses
increased by $4 billion from 2007. He said the numbers were
released by the  Internal Revenue Service .  
 “Current stock option accounting and tax rules are out of
kilter,” Levin said in a statement. He said companies
“benefited from an outdated and overly generous stock option
tax rule that produces tax deductions that often far exceed
companies’ reported expenses. It’s a stock option tax break we
can no longer afford and ought to end.”  
 Levin’s legislation would limit tax deductions that
companies claim on tax filings to the amount they report as an
expense to shareholders. He previously introduced versions of
the bill in 1997, 2003 and 2007.  
 Current rules allow companies to report different stock
option expenses to the IRS than they do to investors. An option
provides the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a
specific amount of stock at a set time.  
 Levin’s proposal would also subject stock options to rules
limiting to $1 million the amount of employee compensation that
can be deducted. Performance-based pay, including stock options,
currently is exempt from the cap.  
 Levin said his Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
found that hundreds of companies are benefiting from a gap
between new accounting rules that require companies to report
stock options to shareholders as an expense when granted and 41-
year-old tax rules that let them deduct any gains when the
options are exercised.  
 Levin estimated his bill would generate as much as $15
billion in revenue annually.
