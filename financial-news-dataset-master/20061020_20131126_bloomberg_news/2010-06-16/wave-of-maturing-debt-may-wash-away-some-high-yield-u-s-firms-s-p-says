             A wave of maturing debt may “wash
away” some speculative-grade U.S. companies as Europe’s
sovereign crisis pushes up borrowing costs and credit markets
freeze, according to Standard & Poor’s.  
 Junk-rated borrowers led by “consumer-dependent
companies” will struggle to “refinance at the rates they’ll
need for long-term survival, if they can find financing at
all,” S&P said in an e-mailed report today.  
 U.S. non-financial corporate borrowers have more than $1.7
trillion of bonds and loans due from 2011 through 2014, and
those rated BB+ or below may “encounter serious hurdles to
their refinancing needs,” S&P managing director  John Bilardello 
said in the report.  
 Companies sold the least amount of bonds in a decade last
month as concern Europe’s debt crisis will slow the global
economy drove up relative borrowing costs by the most since the
aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse in 2008.
U.S. high-yield bond sales totaled $6.8 billion in May compared
with $24 billion in the same period last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The three-month London interbank offered rate, the most
widely-used measure of bank lending costs, jumped to 0.539
percent yesterday, the highest in 11 months, as Europe’s fiscal
woes increased banks’ reluctance to provide credit.  
 Maturing corporate debt will peak at more than $550 billion
in 2014, with 72 percent of that owed by U.S. junk-rated issuers,
according to S&P. A rating below BBB- is known as high yield,
junk or speculative grade.  
 Consumer Spending  
 Restaurants and retailers have $8.9 billion of debt due in
2011, $12 billion in  2012  and $16.9 billion maturing in 2013,
S&P said. Media, entertainment and leisure companies have $17.7
billion due in 2011, $36.5 billion in 2012 and $50.6 billion
maturing in 2013.  
 Though U.S. speculative-grade defaults dropped to 6.7
percent at the end of May from a high of 11.3 percent in
November, the “apparent improvement in credit quality is
fragile and may not ultimately be sustainable,” S&P said.  
 “While many companies shored up their balance sheets and
took advantage of favorable rates and accessible credit markets
earlier in the year, we don’t really expect speculative-grade
companies to enjoy a broad sustained improvement in credit
quality,” Bilardello said.
