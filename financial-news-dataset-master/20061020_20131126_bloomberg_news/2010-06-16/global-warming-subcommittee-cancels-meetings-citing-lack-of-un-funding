             A subcommittee overseeing carbon
dioxide emission credits created under United Nations treaties
on global warming said it would cancel meetings this year
because of a lack of funds.  
 The Joint Implementation Supervisory Committee, which
manages credits used to offset CO2 emissions limits under the
1997 Kyoto Protocol, said it would cancel a meeting of its
accreditation panel scheduled in August and of its main body in
September and December. Delegates will meet in October instead.  
 “Cancelling these regular meetings of the JISC should send
a clear message to the parties that funds are needed
immediately,” Benoit Leguet, chair of the JISC, said in a
statement released by the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, the Bonn-based body organizing the international
global warming talks.  
 The next round of talks involving delegates from 190
nations is set for August to set out the agenda for meetings in
November and December in Cancun, Mexico. The UNFCCC hasn’t yet
confirmed dates for a meeting it hopes to organize in October.
