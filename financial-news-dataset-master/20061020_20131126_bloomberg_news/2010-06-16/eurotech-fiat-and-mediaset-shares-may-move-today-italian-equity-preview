             Italy’s FTSE MIB Index declined
20.09, or 0.1 percent, to 20,562.63, ending the longest winning
streak in more than three months, in Milan.  
 The following stocks were among the most active on the
Italian market today.  
 Assicurazioni Generali SpA  (G IM) gained 20 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 15.48 euros. “Insurance stocks were among those
that suffered the most from the drop in equity markets and are
now getting up to speed after the recovery of the last few
days,” said  Davide Manenti , a fund manager at Nuovi
Investimenti in Milan.  Fondiara-Sai SpA  (FSA IM) gained 7 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to 8.61 euros.  
 Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM), Italy’s second-biggest cement
maker, followed construction shares lower in Europe, falling
27.5 cents, or 3 percent, to 8.85 euros, ending a five-session
gain.  
 FastWeb SpA  (FWB IM) dropped 34 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
13.13 euros, ending a five-session gain. UBS AG cut its price
estimate on the provider of Internet-based television and video-
on-demand to 15 euros from 19.5 euros. The brokerage kept a
“neutral” rating.  
 Mediaset SpA  (MS IM) retreated 13 cents, or 2.6 percent, to
4.98 euros, the first loss this week. Italy’s biggest private
television broadcaster lost a court challenge to a European
Union decision forcing it to repay millions in subsidies for the
purchase of digital-broadcast decoders. “Implications for
Mediaset are very limited,” Cheuvreux said in a note. The
brokerage kept the stock on its “selected list.”  
 Pirelli & C. SpA  (PC IM), Europe’s third-largest tiremaker,
retreated 0.95 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 48.1 cents, a second
day of losses. Automobile stocks were the worst performers in
Europe today. “European new car sales for May provided evidence
of difficult momentum,” Manenti said.  
 STMicroelectronics NV  (STM IM), Europe’s largest chipmaker,
dropped 24.5 cents, or 3.4 percent, to 6.96 euros, the steepest
decline in more than three weeks. Nokia Oyj cut the second-
quarter outlook for its devices and services unit. Nokia is
STMicro’s main client.
