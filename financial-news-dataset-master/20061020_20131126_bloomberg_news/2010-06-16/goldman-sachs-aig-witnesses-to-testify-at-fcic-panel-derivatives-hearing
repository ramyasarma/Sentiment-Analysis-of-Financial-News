             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and
 American International Group Inc.  representatives will appear at
the next hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission as
the panel explores the role of derivatives in the credit crunch.  
 The hearing will be held June 30 and July 1 in Washington,
the FCIC said today in a  statement  on its website.  
 AIG was bailed out by the U.S. in 2008 after collateral
calls from Wall Street firms including New York-based Goldman
Sachs on contracts tied to subprime mortgages. Derivatives have
been blamed by lawmakers and investor  Warren Buffett  for
bringing the financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008.  
 The panel, led by former California Treasurer  Phil Angelides , will also call witnesses from the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
and the New York State Insurance Department. The statement
didn’t name the witnesses.
