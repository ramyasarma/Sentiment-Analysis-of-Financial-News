             J Sainsbury Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest supermarket chain, said it expects to sell out of
vuvuzela horns within 48 hours as British fans seek to recreate
the atmosphere inside South Africa’s World Cup soccer stadiums.  
 Sainsbury bought 70,000 of the yard-long plastic vuvuzelas,
which have been blaring throughout games during the first week
of the tournament, and has sold 50,000 already, Chief Executive
Officer  Justin King  said on a call with journalists today.  
 “When we bought them, we thought 70,000 was a huge number,
our buyer thought he was being quite bold,” King said. “I
suspect people will be scrabbling away to find stock. I wouldn’t
be surprised if there is stuff coming around from South Africa
as we speak.”  
 Thousands of South Africans have been blaring vuvuzelas at
matches and in the streets during the World Cup tournament.
Sound coming from the instruments can reach 127 decibels, making
them louder than a lawnmower or chainsaw. The horns are selling
for 2 pounds ($2.96) each at Sainsbury, which King said is the
only U.K. supermarket to stock them.  
 The vuvuzelas haven’t contributed “in a major way” to
Sainsbury’s same-store sales, the CEO said.  
 The British Broadcasting Corp. reported two days ago that
vuvuzelas would be banned from inside stadiums “if there are
grounds to do so,” citing  Danny Jordaan , head of the local
organizing committee. The local committee then said use of the
horns will continue to be allowed during the soccer tournament
and that “the status quo hasn’t changed.”
