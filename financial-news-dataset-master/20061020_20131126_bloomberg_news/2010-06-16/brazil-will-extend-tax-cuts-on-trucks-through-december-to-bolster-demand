             Brazil plans to extend tax cuts on
the sale of trucks, tractors and pick-ups through December to
boost sales, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said.  
 Truck sales haven’t rebounded as fast as passenger car
sales following the global economic slump, Mantega told
reporters today in Brasilia. The government will also keep tax
breaks on imports of auto parts, he said.  
 Brazil first cut taxes on vehicle sales in December 2008 to
shore up domestic demand amid the global financial crisis. The
government has dialed back some tax breaks and raised interest
rates twice this year after domestic demand pushed inflation
over the government’s 4.5 percent target and fueled 9 percent
annual growth in the first quarter, the  fastest  in 15 years.  
 Consumer prices  rose 5.22 percent in the 12 months through
May. Inflation has exceeded the target in every month this year.  
 Brazil sold 51,972 trucks in the first four months of the
year, up 73 percent from 30,120 in the same period a year ago,
according to figures by the country’s automaker association.
Sales are up 36 percent when compared with the same period two
years ago, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.  
 Mantega said in November that he would leave the tax breaks
of trucks in place for another six months to renew the country’s
aging truck fleet, which has an average age of 18 years, and
improve air quality.
