             Angola plans to increase oil exports
in August when 58 cargoes are scheduled to load, according to
the preliminary shipping schedule.  
 Companies including  BP Plc , Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil
Corp. will load at least 55.6 million barrels, or an average of
1.79 million barrels a day, according to shipping programs
