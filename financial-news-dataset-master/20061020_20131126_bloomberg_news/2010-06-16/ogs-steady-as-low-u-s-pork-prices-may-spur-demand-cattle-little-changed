             Hog futures were unchanged after
rising to a two-week high on speculation that U.S. retail pork
demand is increasing as wholesale prices slipped to a two-month
low. Cattle were steady.  
 Wholesale pork  was little changed yesterday at 82.76 cents
a pound, after slipping the previous day to the lowest level
since April 14, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Meatpackers  shipped  5.34 million pounds of pork yesterday, the
most in two weeks.  
 “We saw down movement on product prices, but we followed
it up with very good movement of pork,” said  Chad Henderson , a
market analyst with Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin. “We’re finding a little more demand now,
especially with prices” at current levels.  
 Hog futures for August settlement were unchanged at 82.375
cents a pound at 9:45 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price touched 82.6 cents, the highest for a most-
active contract since June 3.  
 Cattle futures for August delivery were down 0.075 cent, or
0.1 percent, to 88.525 cents a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle
futures for August settlement fell 0.1 cent to $1.10875 a pound.
