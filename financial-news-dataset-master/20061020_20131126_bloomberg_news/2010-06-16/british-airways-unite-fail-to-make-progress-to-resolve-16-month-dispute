             British Airways Plc  and the Unite
union held talks yesterday aimed at solving a 16-month dispute
over staffing levels and the future wage bill for the carrier’s
12,000 cabin crew, the labor group said.  
 No progress was made in the discussions, which were
brokered by Britain’s state-funded Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service, Unite joint General Secretary  Tony Woodley 
said today in a telephone interview, adding that the union hopes
negotiations will resume later this week.  
 A series of strikes that had grounded flights on 22 days
since March 20 ended on June 9 with Unite saying it would ballot
flight attendants on fresh action. Yesterday’s meeting involved
“proximity talks,” with negotiators sitting down in separate
rooms and Acas acting as a mediator, Woodley said.  
 “The process is continuing but we’re not going to give a
running commentary,” British Airways spokesman  Laura Goodes 
said today by telephone.  
 Acas said today that it had presented a “potential way
forward” to both British Airways and Unite last week, with the
aim of trying to break the deadlock, though “regrettably,” the
meeting yesterday had failed to advance talks.  
 “At present there are no further meetings planned but Acas
will monitor developments and our services remain available,”
the mediator said in the e-mailed statement.  
 Prior to this week, negotiations between the two sides were
last held on June 1. Unite has said that while the latest plan
from London-based British Airways may be acceptable, Chief
Executive Officer  Willie Walsh  must also reinstate travel perks
that have been withdrawn from workers who went on strike.  
 British Airways closed down 0.9 percent at 210.9 pence in
London. The stock has gained 0.1 percent since Unite said on
Feb. 22 that members had voted to strike, valuing the company at
2.43 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).
