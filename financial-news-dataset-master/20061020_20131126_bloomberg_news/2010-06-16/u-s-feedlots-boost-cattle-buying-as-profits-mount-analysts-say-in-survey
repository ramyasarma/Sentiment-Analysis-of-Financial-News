             Cattle purchases by U.S. feedlots
may have surged 23 percent in May from a year earlier, as
profits continued for a fourth straight month, analysts said.  
 Feedlots  bought 2.014 million young cattle last month, up
from 1.638 million in May 2009, when purchases were the smallest
for the month since 1996, according to the average estimate of
12 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture will release monthly feedlot inventory figures at 3
p.m. on June 18 in Washington.  
 Feedlots without risk-management plans made $90 for each
steer or heifer sold in May, compared with losses of $55 per
head in May 2009, said  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at the
University of Missouri in Columbia. Purchases, or placements, in
line with analysts’ estimates would mark a 2.5 percent increase
over the average for the previous five years.  
 “There was a lot of red ink a year ago, and that just
caused placements to be very light,” Plain said. “Now
slaughter-steer prices are well above year-ago levels,”
encouraging feedlots to expand herds, he said.  
 Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,200 pounds, when
they are sold to meatpackers.  
 Slaughter-ready cattle futures for August delivery rose
0.475 cent, or 0.5 percent, to 88.6 cents a pound yesterday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price is up 9.6 percent in
the past year. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement
gained 0.55 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.10975 a pound

 Spot-market steer prices  averaged  about 97.5 cents a pound
in May, up 15 percent from the same month last year, according
to USDA data. Corn, the main ingredient in cattle feed, sold for
an average $3.68 a bushel last month on the Chicago Board of
Trade, down 13 percent from May 2009.  
 Cattle prices have rebounded as global meat demand
recovered from the recession, and as U.S. beef output shrank
after farmers cut herds in the past year, Plain said. As of Jan.
1, the U.S. cattle herd was the smallest size in 51 years.  
 “Last year at this time, we were just coming out of the
low in the stock market,” spurring feedlots to slow cattle
purchases over concern for future beef demand, said  Jim Clarkson , an analyst at A&A Trading Inc. in Chicago. “We also
had a wet spring, so there were a lot of things a year ago not
conducive to placing cattle. This year it’s just a more normal
year.”  
 The  total feedlot herd  on June 1 may have increased 0.7
percent to 10.476 million head of cattle, from 10.407 million
last year, according to the survey. Producers sold about 1.89
million cattle to meatpackers in May, down 3.2 percent from a
year earlier, analysts said.
