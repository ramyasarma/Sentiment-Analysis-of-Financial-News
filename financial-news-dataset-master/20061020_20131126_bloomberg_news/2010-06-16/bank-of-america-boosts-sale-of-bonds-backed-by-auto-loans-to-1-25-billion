             Bank of America Corp. increased its
sale of bonds backed by auto loans to by 25 percent to $1.25
billion, according to a person familiar with the offering.  
 The largest top-rated portion, a $481 million slice
maturing in about 1.99 years, will yield 20 basis points more
than the benchmark interest rate, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the terms aren’t public.
