             Germany’s grain harvest will be
higher than previously forecast this year after rain in May and
June boosted wheat and barley yields, agriculture association
Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V. said.  
 Grain production is forecast to be 47 million metric tons,
up from last month’s forecast of 46.5 million tons and down 5.4
percent from 49.7 million tons a year earlier, the Berlin-based
association, known as DRV, said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  
 Germany is the European Union’s second-largest grower of
wheat and barley after France. DRV raised its outlook for at
least a third time.  
 “Weather conditions that were relatively beneficial to
vegetation, with somewhat productive precipitation at the end of
May and beginning of June, clearly improved the yield
development,” DRV said.  
 German wheat production is now forecast to rise 0.4 percent
to 25.3 million tons from 25.2 million tons in 2009, compared
with a May outlook for a drop to 25.1 million tons. The outlook
for yields was lifted to 7.64 tons per hectare (2.47 acres) from
7.57 tons last month.  
 The barley harvest will slip 14 percent to 10.6 million
tons from 12.3 million tons in 2009, DRV said. Last month’s
forecast for the crop was 10.5 million tons. Barley yields will
be 6.28 tons per hectare, up from a May forecast of 6.24 tons.  
 Germany’s corn crop is expected to decline 2.2 percent to
4.43 million tons this year from 4.53 million tons in 2009,
better than the 3 percent drop forecast by DRV in May.  
 The outlook for rapeseed production was lifted to 5.91
million tons, down 5.9 percent from 6.28 million tons in 2009.
The forecast was raised from 5.8 million tons a month ago.
