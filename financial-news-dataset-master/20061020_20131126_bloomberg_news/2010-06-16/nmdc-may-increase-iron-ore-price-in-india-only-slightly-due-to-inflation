             NMDC Ltd. , a state-run Indian iron-
ore producer, may increase prices “only slightly” for local
steel mills this quarter as the country seeks to curb inflation.  
 The company, Asia’s third-largest producer of the material,
will charge more for exports to Japanese and Korean mills next
quarter, Finance Director  Swaminathan Thiagarajan  said in a
phone interview today, without giving details of price gains.  
 “We cannot raise local prices to the extent of export
prices due to inflationary pressure,” Thiagarajan said.  
 Inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 10.16 percent in May.
NMDC, based in Hyderabad, raised the price of so-called iron-ore
fines for Indian clients an interim 35 percent to 2,600 rupees
($56) a ton from April 1 as it continued negotiations with
buyers. It doubled prices for Japanese and South Korean mills
including Nippon Steel Corp. and Posco to more than $122 a ton.  
 NMDC  rose 0.4 percent to 263.30 rupees by 2:31 p.m. in
Mumbai trading.
