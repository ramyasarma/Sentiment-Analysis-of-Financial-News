             Copper advanced for a seventh day,
after a U.S. economic report signaled the recovery is on track,
boosting the outlook for demand. Aluminum, zinc and nickel rose.  
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange gained as
much as 1.4 percent to a two-week high of $6,770 a metric ton,
before trading at $6,760 at 12:19 p.m. in Singapore. Futures in
New York also climbed a seventh day, heading for the longest
rally since August 2007. China’s financial markets are closed
today and will reopen on June 17.  
 “Market worries about some of the more pessimistic
economic scenarios appear to have abated,” David Moore,
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in
an e-mailed report today. “Strong gains on international equity
markets imparted a positive spin on base metal market
sentiment.”  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said production from
factories in the region grew for an 11th month in June,
signaling they are weathering the turmoil caused by Europe’s
fiscal crisis, and triggering gains in equities and oil.
Economists are expecting a report today to show U.S. industrial
production expanded in May by the most in four months.  
 Asian stocks today extended a global rally on optimism the
economic recovery will boost corporate earnings. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index climbed for a fifth day, by as much as 1.3 percent,
while oil gained for a third day to trade above $77 a barrel.  
 Among other LME-traded metals, aluminum rose 0.9 percent to
$2,030 a ton, zinc added 1.4 percent to $1,865 a ton and nickel
added 0.8 percent to $20,380 a ton. Lead gained 0.9 percent to
$1,775 a ton, and tin climbed 0.9 percent to $17,650 a ton.
