             China has rejected North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il’s request to be provided with fighter jets
free of charge, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported, citing a
person in North Korea it didn’t identify. The request was made
last month when Kim visited China, the Korean-language newspaper
said.
