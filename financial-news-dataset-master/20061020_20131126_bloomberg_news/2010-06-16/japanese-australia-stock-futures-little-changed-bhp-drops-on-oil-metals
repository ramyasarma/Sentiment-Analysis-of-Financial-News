             Japanese and Australian  stock 
futures were little changed after the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index in the U.S. dipped less than 0.1 percent with FedEx Corp.
projecting lower-than-estimated earnings.  
 American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. , an electronics
maker that gets 21 percent of its sales in the U.S., finished
1.9 percent down from the Tokyo close. Those of  NTT DoCoMo Inc. ,
whose dividend yield is near its highest level since March 2008,
advanced 0.5 percent. ADRs of BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, slipped 0.4 percent in Sydney after
prices of metals and oil dropped.  
 Yen-denominated futures  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 10,090 in Chicago yesterday,
unchanged from the close in Osaka. They were  bid  in the pre-
market at 10,080 as of 8:06 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 jumped
1.8 percent to 10,067.15 yesterday.  
 “Investors are inclined to book profit after yesterday’s
gain,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees the equivalent of
$450 million in assets at Tokyo-based Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “Uncertainty over the market outlook and a loss
of confidence have driven down the market even though the global
economy remains resilient. Considering corporate earnings, share
prices should be higher.”  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  were little
changed. New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  lost 0.3 percent in
Wellington.  
 Chip Stocks  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  jumped 1.1 percent yesterday to
the highest close since May 18 as growth in New York
manufacturing and gains in U.S. chip shares boosted optimism
corporate earnings will increase. The gauge has fallen 10
percent from a 52-week high on April 15 as swelling government
deficits prompted Standard & Poor’s to cut credit ratings on
Spain, Portugal and Greece.  
 The slump has driven down the average price of shares in
the gauge to 14.8 times estimated earnings, near the lowest
level since January 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 In New York,  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  futures dropped
0.3 percent. The gauge fluctuated yesterday before finishing
down 0.06 percent. A Commerce Department report showed housing
starts fell 10 percent in May, the biggest drop since March 2009.
FedEx Corp., the world’s largest air-cargo carrier, tumbled 6
percent after saying earnings will be $4.40 to $5 a share for
the year that began June 1, trailing the $5.07 estimated by
analysts.  
 Crude oil for July delivery slid 0.5 percent today for the
first decline in four days. Copper futures for September
delivery lost 0.4 percent, adding to a 0.4 percent retreat
yesterday.  
 Henderson Land Development Co., controlled by Hong Kong
billionaire Lee Shau-kee, said it will take a charge of HK$734
million ($94 million) against earnings after sales of 20 luxury
flats were canceled, including one it had claimed as a world
record.
