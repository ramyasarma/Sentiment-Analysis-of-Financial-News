             Vale SA may seek to exchange assets
with Aquila Resources Ltd. as the companies try to settle a
dispute over two coal projects in Australia’s Queensland state,
the Australian Financial Review reported, citing Vale spokesman
Noel Herley. A swap where Vale receives Aquila’s stake in the
Belvedere project in exchange for giving up control of the Eagle
Downs joint venture has been discussed, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information.
