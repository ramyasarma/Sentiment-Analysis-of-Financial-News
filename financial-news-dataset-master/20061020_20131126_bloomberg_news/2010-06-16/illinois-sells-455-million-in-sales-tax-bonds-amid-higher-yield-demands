             Illinois , whose projected deficit
equals half its proposed $25.9 billion budget, sold $455.1
million in sales tax-backed bonds yesterday, as investors
demanded higher yields from the state.  
 The debt carries the top rating from Standard & Poor’s and
AA+ from Fitch Ratings, the second-highest. That’s better than
the state’s grade on general-obligation debt, which is ranked A
by Fitch, its sixth-highest, and A1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, the same as California. The state’s debt servicing on
the bonds has priority over the general fund for the sales-tax
revenue.  
 Bonds with a 5 percent coupon maturing in 2020 yielded 4.02
percent, 82 basis points above  top-rated  tax-exempts, according
to Municipal Market Advisors. Investors paid 108 cents on the
dollar for the debt. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “The depth of Illinois buyers has been somewhat sparse due
to the noise that’s been coming from the state,” said  Mitch Kapnick , managing director of municipal securities at Cabrera
Capital Markets LLC, which led underwriters. “We saw strong
investor demand particularly when we compare to the similar deal
in December.”  
 Chicago-based Cabrera Capital had orders from about 35
buyers who were mostly money managers and institutions, compared
with “only a handful of interest in December,” he said. The
decision to reduce the offering to $455.1 million from $500
million was made before the sale.  
 ‘Less Bonds’  
 “We determined that we could achieve the goals of the sale
with less bonds,”  John Sinsheimer , Illinois’s director of
capital markets, said in an e-mail. “We were oversubscribed in
all maturities. Pricing was far better than we anticipated.”  
 The state’s previous issue of sales-tax-backed bonds was
for $375 million. Securities maturing in 2020 with the same
coupon, priced to yield 3.9 percent, with investors paying more
than 107 cents on the dollar.  
 The yield at pricing was 76 basis points higher than  11-
year  top-rated debt. The bonds traded June 14 at 3.77 percent, 
59 basis points  more than top-rated comparable maturities,
according to MMA.  
 “The Illinois name is creating a drag on all the credits
coming out of the state,” Kapnick said. “Ten to 15 accounts
didn’t play because they said it was priced too tight with the
Illinois name, regardless of the senior lien.”  
 Illinois 5-year credit-default swap jumped 4 basis points
today to 295 basis points, or $295,000 per $10 million of debt,
the highest level ever, according to CMA DataVision. That brings
the total two-week jump to 70 basis points.  
 Five-year credit-default swaps for California have climbed
50 basis points in 14 days, reaching $299,000, as of 11:30 a.m.
in New York.
