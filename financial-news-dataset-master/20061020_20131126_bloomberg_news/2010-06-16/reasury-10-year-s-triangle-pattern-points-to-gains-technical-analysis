             The  Treasury  10-year note yield is
poised to decline beyond its lowest level this year as the its
trend lines form a “bullish triangle pattern” according to
Nomura Holdings Inc., citing technical analysis.  
 A triangle pattern is formed when upper and lower trend
lines intersect. Ten-year yields fell on May 25 to 3.06 percent,
the lowest level this year, as Europe’s debt crisis spurred
demand for the relative safety of U.S. debt. The yield
subsequently rose, reaching 3.41 percent on June 3.  
 The two levels formed the base and apex of the triangle,
said  Walter Burke , a fixed-income technical strategist at
Nomura, one of the 18 primary dealers obligated to participate
in Treasury auctions.  
 “The chart pattern suggests the market will try to push
toward the low yield of the range again,” Burke said in a phone
interview. “The market is signaling there will be a breaking
down to new yield lows, below 3.06 and possibly toward 3
percent.”  
 The yield on the 10-year note today dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.28 percent at 1:29 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. It earlier
touched 3.31 percent, near the highest level since June 4.  
 In technical analysis investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
