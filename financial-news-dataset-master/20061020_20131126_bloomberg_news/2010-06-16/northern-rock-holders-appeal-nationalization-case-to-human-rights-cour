             Northern Rock Plc  shareholders
seeking payment from the U.K. government for stock they claim
was made worthless when the bank was nationalized asked the
 European Court of Human Rights  to take their case.  
 Small shareholders expect to win “fair compensation” from
the court in Strasbourg, France, since investors in other
bailed-out banks were treated more favorably, Dennis Grainger, a
plaintiff in the case, said today in a statement.  
 “The shareholders, the true owners, of Northern Rock, were
treated very differently by the government when compared to
shareholders in other U.K. banks which subsequently received
financial assistance,” Grainger said in the statement.  
 Northern Rock, nationalized in February 2008, was the first
U.K. casualty of the credit crunch. The lender nearly collapsed
in 2007 after it had to seek emergency funding from the Bank of
England and then suffered a run on its deposits.  
 Shareholders in July 2009 lost a court bid for compensation
after a three-judge panel at the Court of Appeal in London threw
out a lawsuit filed by hedge funds SRM Global,  RAB Capital Plc 
and a group of private investors.  
 A call to the U.K. Treasury office wasn’t immediately
returned.
