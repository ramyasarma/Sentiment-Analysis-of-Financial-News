             Oil dropped from close to a one-
month high in New York as a stronger dollar reduced the appeal
of commodities to investors.  
 Oil retreated as the U.S. currency rebounded against the
euro, limiting crude’s appeal as an inflation hedge. The euro
fell as low as $1.2264 from $1.2332 yesterday. A U.S. government
report today is expected to say crude  inventories  declined last
week, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 “The link between oil and other markets, like equities and
the euro-dollar, is still very strong,” said Sintje Diek, an
analyst at HSH Nordbank in Hamburg. “The fundamental picture is
improving a bit, but nevertheless we still have very high
inventories.”  
 Crude for July delivery fell as much as 71 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $76.23 a barrel and was at $76.26 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:07 p.m. London time. The
contract surged $1.82 yesterday to $76.94, the highest closing
price since May 6.  
 New York crude broached a closely watched pricing point
yesterday, ending above the 200-day moving average of $76.77 for
the first time in a month.  
 Oil is set to surpass this year’s highs above $87 a barrel
after breaching the 200-day moving average yesterday, a
“major” chart resistance level, according to Schork Group Inc.  
 “At this point it is now hard to argue against a retest of
the highs from early May,” Schork said in an instant message.  
 Crude reached a 19-month high of $87.15 a barrel on May 3
before tumbling as much as 26 percent.  
 Inventory Outlook  
 Brent crude for August settlement declined 27 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $76.83 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange as of 1:03 p.m. It climbed $1.44, or 1.9 percent, to
$77.10 a barrel yesterday. The July contract expired after
rising $1, or 1.3 percent, to end the session at $76.20 a barrel
yesterday, the highest settlement since May 14.  
 The Energy Department is likely to say  inventories  declined
1 million barrels in the week ended June 11, according to the
median of 15 analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 U.S. gasoline  inventories  were probably little changed last
week, the Bloomberg News analyst survey shows. Stockpiles of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, are forecast to climb 1 million barrels. The department
is due to release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  
 Oil’s gains yesterday were tempered after the industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude
stockpiles rose 579,000 barrels to 358.7 million.  
 Statoil Rig Orders  
 The API report also showed a gain of 107,000 barrels at the
Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for the New York oil futures,
pushing supplies to 37.5 million, according to a note by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts.  
 Statoil ASA , Norway’s biggest oil and gas producer,
declared force majeure to change the terms on two rig contracts
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico because of a ban introduced on
deepwater drilling after the BP Plc oil spill.  
 “The moratorium created a very challenging situation for
all parties involved in Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling,”
 Kjersti Tvedt Morstoel , a Statoil spokeswoman, said today by
telephone. There’s “considerable cost exposure, as well as many
operational, legal and other challenges facing rig operators,
suppliers and contractors,” she said.  
 Force majeure is a contractual provision under which a
supplier may claim legal immunity from failing to deliver goods
or services because of events outside its control.
