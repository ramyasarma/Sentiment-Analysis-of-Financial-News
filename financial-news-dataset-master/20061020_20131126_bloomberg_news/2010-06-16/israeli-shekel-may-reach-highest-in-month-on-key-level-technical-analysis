             The shekel may strengthen against
the dollar to a one-month high as the currency approaches a key
level, according to analysts at Barclays Capital.  
 If the currency breaches 3.809 per dollar, it may pull back
toward 3.76 per dollar, analysts led by  Jordan Kotick , the
global head of technical analysis at Barclays, wrote in a note
dated June 15.  
 On May 6 Kotick wrote that the shekel would weaken to a
nine-month low against the dollar to 3.95. The currency fell as
much as 2 percent after his report, trading as low as 3.8963 per
dollar on June 8.  
 “Evidence of bearish divergence on daily charts points to
a significant correction, and if trendline support at 3.809 were
to give way, then we would allow for a pullback towards 3.76,”
Kotick wrote.  
 The shekel advanced 0.1 percent to 3.8122 per dollar as of
1:45 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The Israeli currency has strengthened 1.7
percent versus the dollar in the past week.  
 Technical analysts look at price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines.
