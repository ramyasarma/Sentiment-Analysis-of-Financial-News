 George Williamson Kenya Ltd.  (GWKL KN), a Kenyan tea
producer, advanced 3.7 percent to 227 shillings at the close,

country’s weekly auction in Mombasa. African tea prices
increased “substantially” amid strong demand, James Finlay
(Mombasa) Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  
 MRS Oil Plc  (CHEVRON NL) climbed to an 11-month high after
the Vanguard newspaper reported the company formerly known as

fuel in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. The stock gained
4.35 naira, or the daily maximum limit of 5 percent, to close at
91.35 naira in Lagos, the highest since July 13, 2009.  
 Safaricom Ltd. , Kenya’s biggest mobile-network operator,
advanced 15 cents, or 2.7 percent, to 5.75 shillings, its
highest since May 10, as Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd. said
investors outside the country showed renewed interest in the
stock. “Foreign buyers” have become interested in Safaricom
following the company’s “roadshows,” which the company has held
in several countries to give information to investors about
performance and outlook, said  Gregory Waweru , an analyst at the
Nairobi-based brokerage, in a phone interview.
