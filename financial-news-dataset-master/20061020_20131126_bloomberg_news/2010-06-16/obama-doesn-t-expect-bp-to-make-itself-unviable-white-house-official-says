             The Obama administration doesn’t
expect BP Plc to agree to anything that would make the company
unviable, including dismantling itself, a senior White House
official said today.  
 BP Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  and Chairman  Carl- Henric Svanberg  arrived at the White House for a meeting that
will include President  Barack Obama . The president is scheduled
to make a statement on the result at 12:15 p.m. Washington time.  
 The administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the White House expects “tangible progress” in
talks on an escrow fund to cover cleanup costs and claims
stemming from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 Obama plans to attend the meeting for 20 minutes as the
administration and oil-company executives try to hammer out an
accord on a compensation fund administered by a third party.
 David Axelrod , Obama’s senior adviser, said today there is no
limit on the so-called escrow account.  
 “There’ll be no upward cap there. If they owe more money,
they’ll have to pay more money,” Axelrod said on NBC’s
“Today” show. “This is not a get-out-of-the-situation-free
card.”  
 Legal Authority  
 At issue is the size of the fund, the naming of a person to
administer it and whether BP shareholders would have to approve
the transfer of money required for the account, according to
people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be
identified describing the private talks.  
 “We believe we have the authority to compel” creation of
a compensation fund administered by a third party, Axelrod said
on NBC.  
 Obama said in a nationally televised address yesterday from
the Oval Office that he will inform Svanberg “that he is to set
aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers
and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his
company’s recklessness.”  
 Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, has
suggested that BP set aside $20 billion for the fund.  
 The White House, for the moment at least, has declined to
release a list of administration and BP officials attending the
negotiating session, which will be held in the Roosevelt Room
across a hallway from the Oval Office.
