             Polska Grupa Energetyczna SA ,
Poland’s largest power utility, and the Polish unit of France’s
GDF Suez will build a power plant together as the central
European country seeks to expand and upgrade capacity.  
 Each company will own 50 percent of the coal-fired plant to
be built near the city of Lublin, the Warsaw-based company known
as PGE said in an e-mailed statement today, without giving a
capacity or value for the venture.  
 Poland, which depends on coal for about 95 percent of its
power, needs to invest more than 200 billion zloty ($60 billion)
in power generation through 2025 to comply with European Union
rules.  
 Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA  would be the “natural” fuel
supplier for the plant,  Tomasz Zieba , a spokesman for the
company that mines coal near Lublin, said in an e-mailed
response to questions from Bloomberg News.  Sylwia Filimon , a
spokeswoman for PGE, declined to comment beyond the information
in the statement.
