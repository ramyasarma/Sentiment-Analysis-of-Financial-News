             U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said  BP Plc  wants certainty about the level of compensation it
will have to pay over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 “I know from my conversations with BP they want to play
their full part,” Cameron told BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show
today. “While it’s important they pay reasonable claims, they do
want a level of certainty there won’t be claims entered that
will be three or four times removed from the oil spill.”  
 BP Chairman  Carl-Henric Svanberg  will meet President  Barack Obama  at the White House today to discuss how to compensate
victims of the spill after Obama called yesterday for the
creation of a fund. U.S. lawmakers, who will question Chief
Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  tomorrow, have said the company
should suspend its dividend and put $20 billion in an
independently administered escrow account to pay claims.  
 Cameron said he wouldn’t enter into “megaphone diplomacy”
with Obama in the face of calls from listeners to the show for
him to take a more aggressive stance in defense of the London-
based company.  
 “In the end, the company that holds the license has to take
the predominant responsibility,” Cameron said. He said the
company was important to the economies of both the U.K. and U.S.

                          June 16 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Hans Nichols reports on President Barack Obama's national address on Tuesday about BP Plc's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
     Obama said the spill is an urgent call for action to cut U.S. dependence on fossil fuels and vowed that BP will be required to spend whatever is needed to repair damage caused by the company’s "recklessness." The oil gushing from a damaged BP well in the Gulf is threatening the shores of four states, and a team of scientists yesterday raised the estimate of the leak rate to 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. Bloomberg's Mark Barton also speaks. (Source: Bloomberg)
