             Royal Dutch Shell Plc said it has
restored output at its Forcados crude export terminal in
Nigeria, which was shut because of disruptions by armed groups
in the southern Niger River delta.  
 “We’ve been able to restore production to the level we
were before,”  Mutiu Sunmonu , head of Shell companies in
Nigeria, said in an interview in Lagos yesterday. “We’re
beginning to see an upward swing in production because of the
peace returning to the delta.”  
 He didn’t give current output figures. The Forcados
terminal normally has capacity for about 400,000 barrels a day.  
 Attacks by armed groups in the delta, home to Nigeria’s oil
and gas industry, cut the country’s output by more than 28
percent between 2006 and 2009, according to Bloomberg data.
Nigeria, which vies with Angola as Africa’s top producer, is the
fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports.  
 Rebel attacks on the energy industry have dropped since
thousands of fighters accepted a government amnesty last year
and agreed to disarm. Nigeria’s oil production rose to almost
2.1 million barrels a day last month from 1.75 million barrels a
day in July 2009, according to Bloomberg data.  
 Shell is the operator of a joint venture in which the state
oil company Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. holds a 55 percent
stake. Shell holds a 30 percent interest, followed by Total SA
with 10 percent and Eni SpA with 5 percent.
