             Harvard University lacrosse  coach
John Tillman is moving to the  University of Maryland  to try to
guide the school to its third national title.  
 Tillman, 41, signed a seven-year contract for an
undisclosed amount at Maryland. He resigned the Harvard job with
a 20-19 record in three seasons.  
 Tillman replaces  Dave Cottle , who stepped down following
Maryland’s 7-5 loss to Notre Dame in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association quarterfinals.  
 Cottle had a 99-45 record in nine seasons at Maryland, and
guided the Terrapins to eight consecutive postseason
appearances, including three Final Fours, but never took them to
the championship game. Maryland’s national titles came in 1973
and 1975.  
 “What makes this lacrosse program special is its
importance to the school and the state of Maryland,” Tillman
said in a  press release . “The tradition here is phenomenal.”  
 He inherits a team that finished the 2010 season ranked
14th in the nation in scoring (11.3 goals a game) and ninth in
defense (8.4 goals a game) and that will only lose two starters
to graduation.  
 Tillman’s final recruiting class at Harvard was rated No. 3
in the nation, according to Inside Lacrosse.  
 Before he was hired at Harvard, Tillman spent 12 years as
an assistant coach at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Maryland.
