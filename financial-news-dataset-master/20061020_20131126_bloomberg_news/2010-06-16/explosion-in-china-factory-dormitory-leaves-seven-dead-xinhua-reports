             An explosion in a dormitory of a
plant in northern China left seven workers dead and one injured,
the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Baoding
city government.  
 The explosion in the four-story building is believed to
have been caused by explosives that were being illegally held at
the privately-owned slabstone plant in Yixian county, Hebei
province, Xinhua said.  
 Six workers were found dead in the collapsed building and
and another died later in hospital, Zhang Gangqiang, deputy
director of the Baoding government information office, was
