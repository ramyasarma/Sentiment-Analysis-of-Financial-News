             Japan will tighten controls on
sending money to North Korea next month as part of additional
sanctions in response to a suspected sinking of a South Korean
warship.  
 The cap on undeclared cash transfers will be lowered to 3
million yen ($32,800) from 10 million yen, according to a
statement released by the  Ministry of Finance .  
 The ministry also will reduce the amount of money an
individual can take into North Korea to 100,000 yen from
300,000 yen. The change will take effect on July 6, the
statement said.
