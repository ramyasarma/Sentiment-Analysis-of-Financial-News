             Wheat prices rose to a one-month
high and soybeans climbed for the third time in four sessions as
wet weather disrupted field work in the U.S. Midwest and Great
Plains. Corn advanced to a five-week high.  
 As much as six times the normal amount of precipitation
fell in the past week from Iowa through Texas, National Weather
Service  data  show. The rain may delay soybean planting that the
government said was 91 percent  complete  on June 13. Winter-wheat
harvesting was 9 percent finished, below the five-year average
of 12 percent for this time of year, government data show.  
 “We have a situation where there’s a lot of moisture in
the Corn Belt, and we don’t have all the beans in the ground,”
said  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter, Kansas.
“There may be some ponding, and we may have to replant some
bean acres. You have the winter-wheat harvest at a standstill in
a good area.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 2
percent, to $4.7675 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $4.83, the highest price for a most-
active contract since May 13. The price has gained 11 percent in
the past week.  
 The Canadian Wheat Board has said that as many as 12.5
million acres normally planted with spring crops would be
unseeded because of wet weather. Wheat planting in Western
Canada, the biggest growing area, will be 19.15 million acres,
the lowest amount since 1971, the board said.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 9 cents, or 1
percent, to $9.245 a bushel.  
 Corn Rally  
 Corn rose on signs of increased demand from importers and
ethanol producers. China bought 120,000 tons from U.S. shippers
for delivery before Aug. 31, the Department of Agriculture said
this week. Ethanol producers may use 4.7 billion bushels in the
year that starts on Sept. 1, up from 4.55 billion a year
earlier, the agency has said.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, at $3.7725 a bushel. The price reached $3.815, the
highest level since May 12. The price has gained 12 percent
since June 7, the last time the grain closed lower.  
 The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of all three
crops.  
 Oat futures for July delivery fell 4 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.70 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price
soared 41 percent in the previous six sessions on adverse
Canadian weather.  
 This year, oats have dropped 2.5 percent, corn has declined
9 percent and soybeans and wheat are down 12 percent.  
 Russia is the top oats producer, followed by Canada. The
grain is used mostly in livestock feed.
