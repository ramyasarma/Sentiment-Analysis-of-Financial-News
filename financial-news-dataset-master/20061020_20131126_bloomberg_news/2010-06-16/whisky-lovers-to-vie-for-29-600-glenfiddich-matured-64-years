             A Scotch whisky matured for more
than six decades sold for 25,200 pounds ($37,245) at an
Edinburgh auction today as collectors vied for rare malts.  
 The bottle is one of 61 produced by the Glenfiddich
distillery and the whisky has matured for 64 years, host
Bonhams said in its catalog. It was bought by an unidentified
purchaser over the telephone. Bidding started at 10,000 pounds.  
 The price, which includes the auctioneer’s fee, compares
with a presale estimate of as much as 20,000 pounds at hammer
prices -- and a world record of 29,400 pounds for a bottle of
Scotch set in Glasgow in 2007.  
 “Prices have been fantastic,” Martin Green, the whisky
specialist at Bonhams, said while setting up the auction.
“Collecting seems to be reaching an all-time high. It’s the
alternative investment angle people are looking at.”  
 The Scotch whisky industry has been weathering the
financial crisis, Green said in an interview. Distillers
meanwhile have been adding capacity to cater to demand in
countries such as China and India.  
 Bonhams  in November sold the Dalmore Oculus, made from
whisky malt vintages as much as 141 years old and stored in a
crystal decanter, for  27,600 pounds  after pricing it in the
same 15,000 to 20,000-pound range as the Glenfiddich.  
 The Glenfiddich sold today was distilled on July 17, 1937,
and bottled on Oct. 24, 2001, according to the label.  
 The sale of 396 lots in total in Edinburgh may raise
between 113,320 pounds and 144,050 pounds based on guide
prices, London-based Bonhams said in an e-mail.
