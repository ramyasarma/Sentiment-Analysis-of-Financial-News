             Cash  premiums for soybeans shipped
to export terminals near New Orleans narrowed relative to
Chicago futures on speculation that U.S. farmers are selling
supplies from last year’s harvest. Corn premiums were steady.  
 The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
June narrowed to 65 cents to 68 cents a bushel above July
futures yesterday from 66 cents to 68 cents on June 15,
government data show. Farmers are selling because July futures
are 33.25 cents above the November contract. Corn’s premium was
unchanged at 37 cents to 39 cent a bushel above July futures.  
 “There are a few beans here and there, and they just kind
of leak out,” said  Ron Uhe , a commodity risk consultant at Mid-
Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois. “They look at the
old-crop price versus the new-crop price, and they’re more
willing to part with them a little bit.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery, after this year’s
U.S. harvest, rose 9 cents, or 1 percent, to $9.245 a bushel
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active
contract has declined 12 percent this year.  
 Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest, rose
2.25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.7725 a bushel yesterday on the
CBOT. Corn is down 9 percent this year, partly on forecasts for
increased U.S. production.
