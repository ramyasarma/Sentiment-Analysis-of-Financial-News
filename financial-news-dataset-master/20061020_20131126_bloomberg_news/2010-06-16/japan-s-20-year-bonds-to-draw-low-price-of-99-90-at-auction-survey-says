             Japan’s sale of 1.1 trillion yen
($12 billion) in 20-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted price
of 99.90, according to the median forecast of 14 traders
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 2 percent
bonds ranged from 99.95 to 99.80, according to the survey.  
 Eight traders said 99.90, three said 99.95, two said 99.85
and one said 99.80.  
 The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.
