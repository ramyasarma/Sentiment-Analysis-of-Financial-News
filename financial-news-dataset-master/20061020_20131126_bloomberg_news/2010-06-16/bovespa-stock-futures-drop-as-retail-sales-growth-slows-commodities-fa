             Brazil’s  Bovespa  stock index
advanced for a second day as a rebound in commodities prices and
an increase in U.S. industrial production overshadowed a
slowdown in domestic retail sales.  
 Cosan SA Industria e Comercio , the world’s biggest sugar-
cane processor, jumped after sugar prices rose to a seven-week
high in New York.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-
controlled oil company, gained for the first time in four days
as crude reversed an earlier loss. Gains were limited as  Telemar
Norte Leste SA  plunged, leading declines in telecommunications
shares after a share-swap offer was rejected.  
 The  Bovespa  stock index rose 0.5 percent to 64,750.71.
Forty-two stocks increased while 21 fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small
Cap  index rose 0.1 percent to 1,145.34. The real weakened 0.2
percent to 1.7907 per dollar.  
 “The macro outlook continues to be positive for Brazilian
companies,” said  Julio Martins , a partner at Adinvest
Consultoria, a Rio de Janeiro-based equity advisory firm. “The
outflows of foreign capital because of the turbulence in Europe
have stopped.”  
 Retail sales in Brazil rose 9.1 percent in April from a
year earlier, down from a 15.7 percent increase in March, which
was the most since the national statistics agency’s series began
in 2001. The April figure was less than the 10.1 percent median
estimate of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Production gains in the U.S., Brazil’s second-biggest
trading partner, were led by increases in automobiles and
utilities, showing manufacturers are weathering the European
debt crisis. Output at factories, mines and utilities increased
1.2 percent last month after a 0.7 percent gain in April,
figures from the Federal Reserve in Washington showed today.  
 Takeover Vote  
 Telemar slid the most since December 2008, losing 6.5
percent to 52 reais after  Brasil Telecom SA  minority
shareholders rejected the price in a share-swap offer. Investors
turned down the deal after Telemar, which bought control of
Brasil Telecom last year, cut the proposed swap ratio by about
21 percent, saying its rival had higher-than-estimated legal
liabilities.  
 Brasil Telecom fell 3.5 percent to 12.06 reais. Cosan rose
4 percent to 22.54 reais, the highest price since April 26.  
 The Bovespa index  trades  for 12.1 times analysts’ 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 11.8 times for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations’ stocks and 15.4
times for Mexico’s IPC index, according to weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 13.7 times the reported
profits of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November,
the most in almost six years, weekly data show.  
 Brazilian stocks rose yesterday after reports showed the
economies of China and the U.S., the two biggest buyers of
Brazilian exports, gained strength.
