             Canadian lawmakers are urging Prime
Minister Stephen Harper’s government to “clarify” regulations
that prohibit foreigners from controlling phone companies.  
 The House of Commons Industry Committee, which held
hearings on the issue earlier this year, issued a report today
saying a “control in fact” rule that forbids foreigners taking
effective control of a company through non-equity means such as
debt is open to interpretation and controversial. The committee
also recommended the satellite industry be open to foreign
competition.  
 While only making two recommendations, the report also said
the “economic case” for removing foreign ownership
restrictions in the telephone industry is “clear.”
