             An index of  mortgage applications  in
the U.S. jumped 18 percent as refinancing rose to the highest
level in a year and purchases increased for the first time in
six weeks.  
 The gain in the Mortgage Bankers Association’s index in the
week ended June 11 followed a 12.2 percent decrease the previous
week. The Washington-based group’s refinancing gauge surged 21
percent while  purchases  rose 7.3 percent, halting a plunge that
took the measure the prior week to the lowest level since 1997.  
 Financing requests by prospective homebuyers sank after a
government tax credit worth as much as $8,000 expired in April,
indicating the housing industry will take time to recover
without assistance. Sales instead will depend on the magnitude
of gains in employment and a deceleration in foreclosures.  
 “We’re kind of going from a government-aided recovery to a
more sustainable recovery and it will take a while to make that
switch,”  Leif Thomsen , chief executive officer of Mortgage
Master, a Walpole, Massachusetts-based lender, said in an
interview before the report.  
 The  share  of applicants seeking to refinance a loan rose to
74.8 percent from 72.2 percent the prior week.  
 The average rate on a  30-year  fixed loan increased to 4.82
percent from 4.81 percent the prior week. The rate reached a
record low of 4.61 percent in March 2009 after the Federal
Reserve expanded a mortgage-purchasing plan aimed at reducing
borrowing costs. The program ended in March of this year.  
 At the current 30-year rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be about $525.87, compared with $567.79
a year ago, when the rate was 5.50 percent.  
 Mortgage Rates  
 The average rate on a 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 4.23
percent from 4.26 percent, and the rate on a one-year adjustable
mortgage increased to 7.07 percent from 6.94 percent.  
 The tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which was
extended in November to include some current owners, required
contracts be signed by April 30 and settled by June 30.  
 Homebuilders are becoming more  pessimistic  as the lapse of
the credit brought fewer potential buyers. The National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index
fell to 17 in June from 22 a month earlier. Readings below 50
signal more builders view the market as poor.  
 Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. , the largest homebuilder in New
Jersey, earlier this month reported a narrower loss for the
fiscal second quarter as it reduced writedowns on land it owns.
Orders for new homes fell 17 percent and contract signings in
May were slower.  
 “The tax credit helped pull some sales forward,”  Ara K. Hovnanian , chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “We recognize that the expiration of the federal
homebuyer tax credit, the lack of job growth and a potential
increase in foreclosures all pose risks to a housing industry
recovery.”
