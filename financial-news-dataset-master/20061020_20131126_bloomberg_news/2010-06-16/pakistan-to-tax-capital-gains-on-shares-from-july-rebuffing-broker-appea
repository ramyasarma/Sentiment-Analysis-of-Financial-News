             A Pakistani panel of lawmakers said
a capital gains tax on shares introduced in the federal budget
will be imposed on stocks sold after July 1, rejecting an appeal
by stockbrokers that purchases before June 30 be exempted.  
 Any shares sold after July 1 will attract a levy of 10
percent if they were held for less than six months and 7.5
percent for those held for between six months and a year, Sohail
Ahmed, the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue said at a
meeting of the panel of lawmakers in Islamabad today. According
to the budget, there will be zero tax for equities held longer.  
 Finance Minister  Abdul Hafeez Shaikh  announced in his
annual budget speech on June 5 that a capital gains tax would be
imposed for the first time since 1976. Former finance minister
 Shaukat Tarin , Shaikh’s predecessor, had agreed with the  stock
exchange  the levy would be applied only on shares bought after
July 1, according to Haroon Askari, operations manager at the
exchange.  
 The panel also rejected a request by brokers’ that overseas
investors be taxed in their currencies, Ahmed said today.
Brokers had asked capital gains be levied in foreign currency
for overseas investors to minimize their currency conversion
losses.  
 The benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange 100 index, rose 2
percent to 9,436.88 at the close today, before the panel’s
decision.
