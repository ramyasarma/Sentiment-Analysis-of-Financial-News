             The New Zealand dollar rose to a
one-month high against its U.S. counterpart as increased demand
at an auction of Spanish bonds damped concern about Europe’s
debt crisis.  
 The Australian dollar declined from its strongest level in
four weeks as crude oil declined after a report showed an
unexpected increase in U.S. jobless numbers. The New Zealand
dollar reversed earlier losses as swaps traders  bet  the nation’s
central bank will raise interest rates for a second straight
meeting in July. Spain sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of
bonds, the maximum set for the auction.  
 “There’s an easing of concerns at least for the European
markets here,” said  Dennis Cajigas , a senior market strategist
at broker Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “Other currencies are seeing
a bit more stabilization.”  
 New Zealand’s dollar traded at 70.09 U.S. cents at 12:28
p.m. in New York from 69.79 yesterday. It touched 70.34 cents,
the highest since May 18. The so-called kiwi was at 63.65 yen
from 63.81 yen. Australia’s dollar traded at 86.35 U.S. cents,
from 86.40, after touching 86.83, the strongest since May 18.
The currency fell 0.7 percent to 78.45 yen.  
 Positive Signals  
 Crude oil declined as much as 1.8 percent to $76.25 on the
New York Mercantile Exchange as U.S. initial jobless claims
increased by 12,000 to 472,000 in the week ended June 12, Labor
Department figures showed. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected the number of applications would drop to 450,000,
according to the median forecast.  
 The Australian dollar has climbed 2.2 percent this month
against the greenback and New Zealand’s currency has gained 3
percent as concern over Europe’s debt crisis eased, spurring
demand for assets linked to growth.  
 Benchmark interest rates are 4.5 percent in  Australia  and
2.75 percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in  Japan 
and as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the
South Pacific nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such
trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.
