             FedEx Corp.,  the world’s largest
air-cargo carrier, forecast annual profit that trailed analysts’
estimates as labor costs climb in a “moderate” economic
recovery. The shares fell the most since December.  
 Earnings for the fiscal year that began June 1 will be
$4.40 to $5 a share, the Memphis, Tennessee-based company said
today. Analysts projected $5.07, the average of 21 estimates
 compiled by Bloomberg . Profit this quarter will be 85 cents to
$1.05, compared with the average analysts’ projection of $1.02.  
 The outlook reflects higher fixed pension expenses, as well
as restoring raises and employee-retirement contributions that
were halted in the recession. FedEx said its forecast is based
on stable fuel prices and “a continued moderate recovery.”  
 “These are some one-time, FedEx-specific expenses which
are putting a cap on their earnings outlook compared to
consensus expectations,”  Kevin Sterling , a BB&T Capital Markets
analyst, said in an interview. “What they’re saying about the
global economy is pretty compelling. They are continuing to see
growth, even in Europe.”  
 FedEx  fell $4.94, or 6 percent, to $78.07 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest one-day drop
since Dec. 17. The shares have declined 6.4 percent this year.  
 Increased Demand  
 The company forecast U.S. economic growth of 3.2 percent
for fiscal 2011. Industrial production, which correlates to
FedEx’s shipping volumes, will rise to 5 percent, Chief
Executive Officer  Frederick Smith  said on a conference call with
analysts and investors.  
 “People have an undue sense of pessimism relative to what
is actually happening out there,” Smith said, referring to
growth in the shipment of high-value goods. Shipping demand is
rising as a growing middle class in India, Brazil and China
increasingly uses the Internet to order goods, he said.  
 “We expect stronger demand for our services and continued
growth in revenue and earnings as global economic conditions
continue to improve in fiscal 2011,” Smith said.  
 FedEx’s annual forecast missed analysts’ estimates in seven
of the past eight years, and there was a similar risk heading
into today’s report because of increased costs to restore cuts
made during the recession,  Jon Langenfeld , an analyst at Robert
W. Baird & Co., wrote in a June 1 note.  
 The Milwaukee-based analyst rates FedEx shares “neutral.”  
 Pension Costs  
 FedEx said it expects pension and retiree medical expenses
to increase $260 million this fiscal year, while cash
contributions to U.S. pension plans will fall by $350 million to
$500 million in fiscal 2011.  
 “We expect the growth in earnings to be constrained by
significant increases” in labor-related expenses as well as for
costs to pull aircraft out of storage to re-enter service, Chief
Financial Officer  Alan Graf  said in the statement.  
 The company took six planes from storage in the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2010 and will add an unspecified number over
the next several quarters, said  Dave Bronczek , chief executive
of FedEx Express.  
 “It’s a big expense to bring an aircraft out of storage,”
said Sterling, the BB&T analyst, who recommends holding FedEx
shares. “They are gearing up for demand, but they have to incur
some expenses for that now.”  
 FedEx reported net income of $419 million, or $1.33 a
share, for the quarter ended May 31, matching analysts’
estimates. Revenue rose 20 percent to $9.43 billion.  
 The income compared with a loss of $876 million, or $2.82 a
share, in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding one-time costs,
the company had a year-earlier profit of 64 cents.  
 Operating profit at FedEx Express, the company’s largest
division, was $413 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of
$136 million. Sales rose 23 percent to $5.88 billion, the
company said.
