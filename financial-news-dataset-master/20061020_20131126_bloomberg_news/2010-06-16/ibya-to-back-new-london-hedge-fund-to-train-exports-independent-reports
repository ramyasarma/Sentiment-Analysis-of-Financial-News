             Libya is putting hundreds of 
millions of dollars behind a hedge fund to be started in London
this summer, as it seeks to diversify its economy and train a 
corps of investment experts, the Independent reported.  
 FM Capital Partners will be run by Frederic Marino and its 
board will include Libyan diplomats and sovereign wealth fund 
officials, the newspaper said.  
 Marino told the Independent the purpose of the project 
isn’t just to generate investment returns but to bring on “a 
generation of people who, in four or five years, will have a 
good level of technical international financial knowledge.”
