             Oil dropped from close to a one-
month high in New York as a stronger dollar reduced the appeal
of commodities to investors.  
 Oil retreated as the U.S. currency rebounded against the
euro, limiting crude’s appeal as an inflation hedge. The euro
fell to $1.2305 at 8:48 a.m. in London from $1.2332 yesterday. A
U.S. government report today is expected to say crude
 inventories  declined last week, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 “The link between oil and other markets like equities and
the euro-dollar is still very strong,” said Sintje Diek, an
analyst at HSH Nordbank in Hamburg. “The fundamental picture is
improving a bit, but nevertheless we still have very high
inventories.”  
 Crude for July delivery was at $76.63 a barrel, down 31
cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 8:49 a.m. London
time. The contract surged $1.82 yesterday to $76.94, the highest
closing price since May 6.  
 Crude broached a closely watched pricing point yesterday,
ending above the 200-day moving average of $76.94 a barrel for
the first time in a month.  
 Brent crude for August settlement dropped 20 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $76.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It climbed $1.44, or 1.9 percent, to $77.10 a
barrel yesterday. The July contract expired after rising $1, or
1.3 percent, to end the session at $76.20 a barrel yesterday,
the highest settlement since May 14.  
 Energy Department Report  
 The Energy Department is likely to say  inventories  declined
1 million barrels in the week ended June 11, according to the
median of 15 analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 U.S. gasoline  inventories  were probably little changed last
week, the Bloomberg News analyst survey shows. Stockpiles of
distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, are forecast to climb 1 million barrels. The department
is scheduled to release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. in
Washington.  
 Oil’s gains yesterday were tempered after the industry-
funded American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude
stockpiles rose 579,000 barrels to 358.7 million.  
 The API report also showed a gain of 107,000 barrels at the
Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for the New York oil futures,
pushing supplies to 37.5 million, according to a note by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts.
