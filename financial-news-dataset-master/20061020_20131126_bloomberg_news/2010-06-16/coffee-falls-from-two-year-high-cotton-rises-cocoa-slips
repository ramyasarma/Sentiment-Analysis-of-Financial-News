             Arabica-coffee futures fell from the
highest price in more than two years on speculation that the
bean’s six-session rally was overdone. Cotton advanced, while
cocoa declined.  
 Coffee output by Brazil, the world’s largest producer, will
rise 23 percent in the year starting July 1, according to a unit
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Through yesterday,
arabica coffee jumped 20 percent since June 7. Earlier, prices
reached $1.6295 a pound, the highest level since March 6, 2008.  
 “The timing of the current rally is wrong,”  Kona Haque , a
London-based analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a report
e-mailed today. “With the upcoming harvest, producers will be
selling heavily at these prices and look to hedge.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery slipped 0.35 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $1.596 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. On London’s Liffe exchange,  robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery  dropped $4, or 0.3 percent, to $1,566 a
metric ton.  
 Arabica futures will retreat to $1.50 by July, Haque said.  
 “This rally that we’ve seen here in the last week is
overdone,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision
Financial Markets in Chicago. “With the volatility being so
high, you don’t really get a rational market. The market’s
overbought.”  
 Cotton futures for December delivery gained 0.08 cent, or
0.1 percent, to 79.7 cents a pound on ICE. The fiber has climbed
5.4 percent this year.  
 In New York, cocoa for September delivery fell $14, or 0.5
percent, to $2,955 a ton. In London, cocoa for July delivery
dropped 34 pounds, or 1.4 percent, to 2,430 pounds ($3,599) a
ton on Liffe.
