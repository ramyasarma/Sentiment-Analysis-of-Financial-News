             The U.S. Department of Agriculture
has banned a private inspector of organic foods from certifying
products bound for the U.S., saying some of its workers were
connected to the Chinese government.  
 The  Organic Crop Improvement Association  may re-apply to be
a certifier of Chinese products in one year, the USDA’s
Agricultural Marketing Service said yesterday in  statement . The
nonprofit organization may continue certifying products in other
countries, including the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the department
said.  
 The USDA said it became aware of the inspectors’
connections to the Chinese government as the result of an onsite
audit of the association’s operations in 2007.  
 Organic-product sales to businesses including Whole Foods
Market Inc. and  Dean Foods Co.  totaled $3.16 billion in 2008,
the USDA said in February, releasing its first-ever  survey of
organic operations .
