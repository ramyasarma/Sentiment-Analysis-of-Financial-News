             The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of
commodity-shipping costs that’s tumbled 28 percent during its
longest losing streak this year, may decline further, according
to technical analysis by Barclays Capital.  
 The gauge fell to 3,020 points yesterday, extending a 13-
day fall on speculation weaker Chinese construction may curb raw
material demand. That may include iron ore, more of which is
hauled at sea than any other dry-bulk commodity. The attached
chart shows the index’s 200-day moving average of 3,164. It fell
as low as 2,911 points in April, 3.6 percent less than now.  
 “The market is running down to its lows from April,”
 Philip Roberts , a technical analyst at Barclays Capital in
London, said by phone. On June 14 it went “below its 200-day
average, which is a bearish signal and suggests those lows are
going to be tested again.”  
 China is the biggest consumer of iron ore, used in
steelmaking, as well as coal, copper and aluminum. Authorities
there have moved to cool the property market. Property sales in
Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen fell as much as 70 percent in May
as developers delayed sales, Shanghai Securities News reported
on June 1, citing data from the Beijing local government.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
