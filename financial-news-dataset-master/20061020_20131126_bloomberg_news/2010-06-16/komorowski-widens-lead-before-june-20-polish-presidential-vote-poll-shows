             Acting Polish President Bronislaw 
Komorowski led Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the opposition
Law & Justice party, by 48 percent to 34 percent before the 
first round of presidential elections set for June 20, Gazeta 
Wyborcza reported, citing a June 11-13 survey of 1,002 voters 
by PBS DGA.   
 Support for Komorowski, the candidate of the ruling Civic 
Platform party, fell 2 percentage points from the previous poll
on June 4, while Kaczynski lost 4 percentage points, the 
newspaper said. According to the survey, Komorowski would 
defeat Kaczynski by 60 percent to 40 percent in a two-candidate
runoff.
