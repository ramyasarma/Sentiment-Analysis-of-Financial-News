             The three Czech parties negotiating
the formation of a new government agreed to delay setting a
target date for euro adoption, sticking to their election-
campaign stance.  
 The Civic Democratic Party, TOP09 and Public Affairs are in
talks to form a Cabinet after winning a combined majority in
elections on May 28 and May 29. The parties, which have pledged
to narrow the fiscal deficit, said they want a coalition
agreement by the middle of July so they can shape the 2011
budget draft.  
 The parties “are currently not setting a date for euro
adoption,” Prague-based Public Affairs said in a statement on
its  website  today. Meeting the Maastricht criteria is “the
first step toward balanced public finances.”  
 Petr Necas , the Civic Democrat leader and the likely next
prime minister, said on May 3 his party was against setting a
euro target because curbing the fiscal deficit was the priority.  
 The public finance shortfall widened to 5.9 percent of
gross domestic product last year, almost double the 3 percent
limit for joining the euro area, after the country fell into the
worst recession since the end of communism two decades ago.  
 The deficit target for this year is 5.3 percent of GDP, and
the gap should narrow to 4.8 percent in 2011, Necas said in a
June 11 interview.
