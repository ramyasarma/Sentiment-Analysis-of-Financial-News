             Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd.’s
incoming Chief Executive Officer Mark Hooper described Aspen
Pharmacare Holdings Ltd.’s takeover bid as “opportunistic”,
the Australian newspaper reported, citing an interview with
Hooper. His appointment yesterday was part of a plan to improve
Sigma’s business so it can continue without a takeover, the
newspaper said.
