             Sugar prices rose to a seven-week
high in New York as importing nations boost purchases. Orange
juice also gained.  
 Sugar exports from Brazil to countries including Iran,
China and in the Black Sea region are increasing, according to a
report by FCStone Group Inc. Prices have jumped 13 percent in
June, heading for the first monthly increase since January.  
 “There is enough physical demand to support prices,” said
 Bruno Lima , a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group in
Campinas, Brazil.  
 Raw sugar for October delivery added 0.1 cent, or 0.6
percent, to 16.05 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier,
prices climbed to 16.17 cents, the highest level for a most-
active contract since April 23.  
 White-sugar futures for August delivery advanced $4.50, or
0.9 percent, to $532.50 a metric ton on the Liffe exchange in
London after touching $535.30, the highest level since March 19.
The 10-session streak of gains is the longest for a most-active
contract since early January.  
 “There’s residual demand and not a lot of sugar going
around,”  Jake Wetherall , a trader with Rabobank International
Ltd. in London, said by telephone. “It is also probably
attracting a little bit of interest from funds.”  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.2 cent,
or 0.1 percent, to $1.446 a pound in New York. The commodity has
advanced 12 percent this year.
