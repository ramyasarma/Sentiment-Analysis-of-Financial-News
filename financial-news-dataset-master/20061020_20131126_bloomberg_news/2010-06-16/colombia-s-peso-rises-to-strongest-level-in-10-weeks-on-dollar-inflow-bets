             Colombia’s peso rose to a 10-week
high amid speculation increased dollar flows into the South
American country will boost the local currency.  
 The peso gained 0.4 percent to 1,911.15 per U.S. dollar at
2:30 p.m. New York time, from 1,919.25 yesterday. That’s the
strongest level on a closing basis since April 5. The peso has
jumped 6.9 percent this year, the best performance among world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 “You not only have foreign direct investment flows coming
into Colombia but also amid the European debt crisis, a lot of
flows are seeking refuge in Latin America given that the
region’s fundamentals are much stronger,” said  Felipe Campos ,
head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Alianza Valores.  
 The government yesterday announced a revised financing plan
that assumes an exchange rate of 1,956 per U.S. dollar this
year, compared with a previous forecast of 2,365, and 1,910 next
year.  
 Colombia will attract about $10 billion in foreign direct
investment this year, Trade Minister Luis Guillermo Plata has
said. The nation received $7.2 billion of foreign direct
investment in 2009 after a record $10.6 billion the previous
year, according to the central bank.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.98
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.126 centavo to 120.374 centavos per peso.  
 ‘Weighing Down’  
 Speculation Colombia’s central bank will extend plans to
buy dollars in the foreign exchange market while selling part of
its peso bond holdings to reduce liquidity is “weighing down”
the bonds, known as TES, according to Campos.  
 Policy makers announced March 3 the bank would buy $20
million a day through June 30 to curb a rally they say left the
peso “misaligned.” Campos said it’s likely that central
bankers will announce at their June 18 monetary policy meeting
that they will continue the daily dollar purchases through the
third quarter.  
 Colombia’s central bank sold 1.2 trillion pesos ($628
million) worth of TES holdings in April while it didn’t sell any
last month. At the end of May, Banco de la Republica held 1.5
trillion pesos of the peso securities, the bank said in a
statement last week.  
 Colombia’s borrowing costs fell at a government auction of
250 billion pesos of inflation-linked bonds today.  
 The nation sold inflation-linked bonds, known as TES UVR,
due February 2023 to yield 4.38 percent, down from 4.46 percent
in the previous sale on May 19, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Finance Ministry. The yield on the securities
maturing in May 2017 fell to 4.10 percent from 4.29 percent.
