             Japan’s  bonds  rose, pushing down
10-year yields from near a two-week high, as Europe’s lingering
fiscal crisis spurred demand for the safety of government debt.  
 Bond futures advanced after local stocks fell and Spain’s
central bank said it plans to publish the results of stress
tests carried out on the nation’s lenders to counter
speculation it needs international aid. Japanese bonds also
gained after an auction of 20-year securities drew the
strongest demand in more than two decades yesterday.  
 “Spain’s financial sector still seems to be under stress,
stoking concern about another disruption in markets,” said
 Akito Fukunaga , Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “Investors are buying bonds
because yields are unlikely to rise much from here.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 fell one
basis point to 1.225 percent at 3:33 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.089 yen to 100.667.  
 Ten-year yields touched 1.245 percent on June 11, the
highest since June 4. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Five-year yields dropped one basis point to 0.4 percent.
Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.13 to
140.41 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.7 percent.  
 Ten-year yields may fall to 1.2 percent by the end of
September, Royal Bank of Scotland’s Fukunaga said. If his
forecast proves accurate, investors who buy securities today
will make a 0.6 percent return, Bloomberg calculations show.  
 Fiscal Problems  
 Spain Prime Minister  Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  is
trying to convince investors he can trim the euro region’s
third-largest deficit, shore up the country’s banks and lift
the economy out of a two-year slump. The euro weakened on
speculation European Union leaders will agree on new financial-
market regulations when they hold a summit meeting today.  
 “External factors such as lingering fiscal problems in
Europe continue to support bonds,” said  Kazuhiko Sano , chief
strategist in Tokyo at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.  
 Yesterday’s 20-year sale drew bids for 4.60 times the
amount on offer, up from a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.93
times at the previous auction in May. That was the highest
ratio since September 1987.  
 “Investors have a consensus that yields will stay low as
the central bank continues monetary easing,” said  Makoto Noji ,
a senior market analyst at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo, a
unit of Japan’s second-largest banking group. “Given that
background, demand rose at the auction with a 2 percent coupon.
The results were pretty good.”  
 The Bank of Japan this week unveiled a new credit program
of as much as 3 trillion yen ($32.9 billion) that will extend
loans to companies for as long as four years to strengthen the
economic recovery. New loans will be extended at the benchmark
interest rate of 0.1 percent.  
 The yen gained to 112.10 per euro from 112.57 in New York
yesterday. The dollar climbed to $1.2271 per euro from $1.2311.
