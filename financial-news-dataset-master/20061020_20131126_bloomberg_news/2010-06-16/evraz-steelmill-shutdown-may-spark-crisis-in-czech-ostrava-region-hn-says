             Shutting down the Evraz Vitkovice
Steelmill could trigger a wave of layoffs that would deal a
heavy blow to the economically troubled Ostrava region,
Hospodarske Noviny reported.   
 Evraz may announce the Vitkovice steelmill shutdown today,
the newspaper said. While the mill has 320 employees, the
shutdown could affect other steel producers including
ArcelorMittal and could result in a loss of as many as 1,000
jobs across the region, according to the report.
