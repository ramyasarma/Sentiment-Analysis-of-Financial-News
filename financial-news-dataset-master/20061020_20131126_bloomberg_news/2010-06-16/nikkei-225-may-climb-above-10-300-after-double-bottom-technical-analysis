             Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  may
surpass 10,300 after its chart formed a so-called double bottom,
according to Mizuho Securities Co.  
 The Nikkei 225 fell to as low as 9,395.29 on May 27 and
rebounded to as high as 9,962.42 on June 4 before sliding to
9,378.23 on June 9. As the average exceeded the June 4 high
today, it formed a double bottom, suggesting a further advance,
said  Yutaka Miura , a senior technical analyst at Tokyo-based
Mizuho.  
 “This double bottom is unusually clear and should be
fairly valid,” he said. “For the Nikkei, 10,000 is a
psychological resistance line. After exceeding that level, the
average is gaining upward momentum and we can expect it to reach
the 200-day moving average.”  
 The  Nikkei 225 , whose 200-day moving average is 10,305,
jumped 1.6 percent to 10,041.80 as of 12:30 p.m. in Tokyo today.  
 The double-bottom form appeared between February and March.
After the form was completed on March 8, the Nikkei 225 climbed
7.1 percent to this year’s high of 11,339.30 on April 5.
