             U.S. stocks retreated as declines in
consumer and energy companies wiped out an afternoon rebound
from early losses. The euro returned lower after briefly erasing
losses in midday trading.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent to
1,111.29 at 3:33 p.m. in New York after gaining as much as 0.3
percent and slumping as much as 0.7 percent. The euro slipped
0.2 percent to $1.2303, erasing a gain of 0.2 percent.
