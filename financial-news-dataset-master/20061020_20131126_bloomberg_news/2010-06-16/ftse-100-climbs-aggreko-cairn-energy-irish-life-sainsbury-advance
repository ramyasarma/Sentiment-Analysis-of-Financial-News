             U.K. stocks  climbed for a sixth day,
the longest stretch of gains in nine months, led by a rally in
Aggreko Plc and Shire Plc after analysts recommended the shares.  
 Aggreko , the world’s largest provider of mobile power-
supply equipment, rose 1.7 percent after Citigroup Inc. upgraded
the stock to “buy.” Shire advanced 2 percent as Deutsche Bank
AG rated the drugmaker “buy” in new coverage. Schroders Plc
limited declines on the FTSE 100 Index, falling more than 3
percent.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100  rose 20.10, or 0.4 percent, to
5,237.92 in London, after swinging between gains and losses at
least five times today. The  FTSE All-Share Index  gained 0.3
percent and Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  advanced 0.3 percent.  
 Aggreko climbed 1.7 percent to 1,470 pence after Citigroup
raised its recommendation for the shares to “buy” from
“hold,” citing the company’s “unique assets.”  
 “Last week’s investor trip to Africa highlighted the sheer
magnitude of opportunity which Aggreko has over the short,
medium and long run in temporary power,” London-based analyst
 David Phillips  wrote in a report to clients. “We think there
are many years of growth in prospect.”  
 Shire  gained 2.5 percent to 1,462 pence after Deutsche Bank
recommended investors buy the drugmaker which said “strong
earnings per share growth and improving sales persistency”
would drive the share price higher.  
 Schroders  led declining shares, falling 3.3 percent to
1,320 pence as Citigroup downgraded the second-largest publicly
traded U.K. money manager by assets to “sell” from “buy.”
Analysts cited concern that retail investor demand will slow
this year.  
 Man Group Plc  also fell, falling 2.6 percent to 239.2
pence. The largest publicly traded hedge-fund firm reported a
3.1 percent decline in the net asset value of its flagship Man
AHL Diversified Futures Ltd. over the last week.  
 Irish Life & Permanent Plc  surged 7.6 percent to 1.86 euros
in Dublin trading.  Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of the
Dublin-based lender with a “buy” recommendation, saying
pessimism on the shares looks “well overdone.”  
 Jupiter Fund Management Plc  climbed 15 percent to 190
pence on their first day of trading in London. The company
priced its initial public offering at 165 pence.
