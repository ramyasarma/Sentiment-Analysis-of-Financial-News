             The International Monetary Fund has
approved a $67.7 million, three-year loan facility for Burkina
Faso to promote economic growth and reduce poverty, the
Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed statement dated June
14.  
 Economic growth, which slowed to 3.2 percent last year from
5.2 percent in 2008, will accelerate to about 4.4 percent this
year and 4.7 percent in 2011, the IMF said.
