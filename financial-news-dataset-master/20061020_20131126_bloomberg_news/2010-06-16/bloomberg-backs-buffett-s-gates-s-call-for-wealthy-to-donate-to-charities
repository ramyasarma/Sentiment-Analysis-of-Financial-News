             New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  backed an initiative promoted by fellow billionaires
 Warren Buffett  and  Bill Gates  calling for rich Americans to
pledge at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes.  
 “This is a fantastic idea, and Bill and  Melinda Gates  and
Warren Buffett are great Americans for leading with it,”
Bloomberg said in an e-mailed statement today. “I am a big
believer in giving it all away and have always said that the
best financial planning ends with bouncing the check to the
undertaker.”  
 Bloomberg, 68, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP, has a net worth that  Forbes Magazine 
estimated in March at $18 billion, ranking him 23rd on its list
of world billionaires.
