             Copper prices slipped, halting a
six-session rally, after a U.S. government report signaled
weaker demand from the construction industry.  
 U.S. housing starts fell 10 percent in May, the biggest
decline since March 2009, the Commerce Department said today.
Building permits, a sign of future demand, dropped to a one-year
low. Construction accounts for a quarter of copper demand,
according to the Copper Development Association. The metal is
down 10 percent this year.  
 “These numbers show there is still a lot of weakness in
housing, and that’s very negative for sentiment in the copper
market,” said  Gijsbert Groenewegen , a partner at Gold Arrow
Capital Management in New York. “There’s been some volatility
lately because people are going back and forth about the
strength of the recovery.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 1.05 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $3.0135 a pound on the Comex in New York, the
first decline since Jun 7. Copper gained 9.3 percent in the
previous six sessions.  
 The metal pared losses of as much as 1.7 percent after a
report showed U.S. industrial production rose last month by the
most since August, reducing economic concerns.  
 Copper for delivery in three months lost $30, or 0.5
percent, to $6,650 a metric ton ($3.02 a pound) on the London
Metal Exchange.  
 Nickel, aluminum, and zinc prices also fell on the LME.
Lead and tin rose.
