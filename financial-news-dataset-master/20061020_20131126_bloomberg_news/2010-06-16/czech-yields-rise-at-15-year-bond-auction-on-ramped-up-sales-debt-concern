             Czech yields rose at today’s auction
of 15-year bonds as the government sold more debt than it had
planned to meet record funding needs and concern about sovereign
debt keeps borrowing costs higher across Europe.  
 The European Union country sold 6.95 billion koruna ($333
million) of its 5.7 percent bonds due in 2024, exceeding the
planned volume of 5 billion koruna, the central bank in Prague
said on its Bloomberg page. The average accepted yield in the
seventh offering of the security rose to 4.582 percent from its
record-low of 4.332 percent at the previous sale on April 21.  
 European bonds have dropped in the past two months, driving
up yields, on concern the Greek sovereign crisis may spread. The
Czech Finance Ministry said on June 1 it will almost double
sales of koruna debt in the third quarter compared with the
previous three months as the country plans to borrow a record
280 billion koruna this year to fund its budget deficit.  
 “Since the ministry has secured only a minor share of its
total 2010 gross financing to date, it is pressured to sell as
much as possible,” Societe Generale SA analysts  Esther Law  and
 Anne-Francoise Bluher  wrote in a report before today’s auction.
“Czech bonds recently came under pressure due to rising
issuance activity and growing risk aversion.”  
 Bids in the first round of today’s sale fell to 11.04
billion koruna from 13.2 billion koruna on April 21, when the
government offered 6 billion koruna of the paper.  
 The secondary-market yield was little changed at 4.623
percent shortly after the auction, up from the record-low 4.367
percent on April 22. Yields move inversely to prices.
