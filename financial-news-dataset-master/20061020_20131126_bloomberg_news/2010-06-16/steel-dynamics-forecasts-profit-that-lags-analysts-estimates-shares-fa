             Steel Dynamics Inc. , the fourth-
largest U.S.-based steelmaker,  forecast  second-quarter earnings
that trailed analysts’ estimates amid decreased profit margins
on recycled metals and lower sales of flat-rolled steel.  
 Earnings-per share will be 20 cents to 25 cents, Fort
Wayne, Indiana-based Steel Dynamics said today in a statement.
Analysts projected profit of 34 cents, the average of 12
 estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The company reported per-share  earnings  of 29 cents a share
in the first quarter and a net loss of 8 cents in the second
quarter of 2009.  
 Steel Dynamics fell 24 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $13.97 at
5:23 p.m. after the close of regular Nasdaq Stock Market
trading.  The shares  had declined 20 percent this year at the end
of the trading day.  
 Nucor Corp. , U.S. Steel Corp. and AK Steel Holding Corp.
are the three largest U.S. steelmakers by 2009 revenue.
