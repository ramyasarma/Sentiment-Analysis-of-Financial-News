             Nomura Holdings Inc. , Japan’s
largest brokerage, may hire as many as 35 bankers in the U.S.
this year, part of a push to become a global securities firm
rivaling Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 The firm plans to have about 100 bankers in the U.S. by the
end of 2010, from about 65 currently,  Glenn Schiffman , Nomura’s
head of Americas investment banking, said in an interview this
week at the firm’s New York headquarters at the World Financial
Center. It has already recruited 50 bankers, he said.  
 Nomura is investing 250 billion yen ($2.74 billion) to
expand in the U.S. after it bought Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.’s Asian and European units in 2008. Chief Executive Officer
 Kenichi Watanabe  said in April that he aims to transform Nomura,
which generates most of its revenue in Japan, into a global
financial firm.  
 “We are in the early stages of creating a full scale
investment bank in the U.S.,” said Schiffman, 40, a former
Lehman banker who helped manage the sale of Lehman’s assets to
Nomura and led the integration of the businesses in Asia.  
 Nomura said this week it hired Deutsche Bank AG’s  Mark Epley  as co-head of a unit that advises on mergers and
acquisitions for buyout firms. Earlier this month, it recruited
 Michael Hill  and  James DeNaut  from Deutsche Bank as co-heads of
global natural resources, based in New York, according to two
people close to the situation. The firm in May appointed Bank of
America Corp.’s  Simon Western  as a managing director in the
financial services institutions group.  
 Competing for Talent  
 “Nomura faces market competition for similar talent, but
their advantage is that they are willing to pay attractively,”
said  Robert Sloan , head of U.S. financial-services recruiting at
Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm.  
 Schiffman started his career in 1991 at Lehman, where he
oversaw financings and mergers and acquisitions worth more than
$100 billion. He was responsible for Lehman’s cable business
from 1996 to 1999 and later ran the global media group. He
relocated to Hong Kong in 2007. That experience may help
Schiffman win business in the U.S.  
 “Natural resources, financial institutions and industrials
are our priority sectors because they represent 65 percent of
fees,” said Schiffman. “Consumer, media and technology are the
other sectors in which we want to expand.”  
 Cross-Border M&A  
 Nomura ranks 15th among global takeover advisers this year,
with $37 billion of deals, up from 19th in the same period a
year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-
based Goldman Sachs is first, with $156 billion of deals,
followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Zurich-based Credit Suisse.  
 Nomura helped advise Spain’s Grifols SA on its $3 billion
agreement last week to buy Talecris Biotherapeutics Holdings
Corp., together with Deutsche Bank and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA. It also advised Jupiter Telecommunications Co. on
the company’s $1.3 billion joint venture with Sumitomo Corp.  
 As head of investment banking, Schiffman is overseeing
Nomura’s U.S. mergers and acquisitions business and predicts
that cross-border deals will increase in volume.  
 “Tapping this trend is part of Nomura’s growth strategy,”
he said.
