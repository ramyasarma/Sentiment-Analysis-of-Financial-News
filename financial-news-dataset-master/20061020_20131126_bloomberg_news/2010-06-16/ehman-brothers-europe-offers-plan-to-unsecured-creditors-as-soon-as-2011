             Lehman Brothers International Europe
will pay unsecured creditors as early as next year under a new
distribution plan, if it is approved by a majority of claimants.  
 Under the so-called consensual approach, LBIE will use
various “processes, data sources and valuation methods” to
value creditors’ claims, the collapsed investment bank’s
administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers said in an e-mailed
statement. PwC said it holds LBIE’s 7.3 billion pounds ($10.8
billion) of available cash.  
 LBIE’s parent company,  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , filed
the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008. LBIE,
liquidating in London, has returned $17.2 billion to creditors
since its collapse, the firm said in  an April report .  
 If creditors approve the proposed plan, the administrators
may settle on the value of most unsecured claims by the end of
the year and begin cash distributions in 2011, PwC said.  
 The plan “will enable the claims to be determined in an
expeditious manner, resulting in significant time and cost
savings to both unsecured creditors and LBIE,” PwC partner
 Steven Pearson  said in the statement. “The timing at which cash
distributions can be made will be accelerated.”  
 The administrators had paid themselves $315 million for
their work liquidating the bank as of March 14, according to
their report in April.
