             Unichem Laboratories Ltd. , an Indian
drugmaker whose shares have doubled in the past year, rejected
several approaches by overseas pharmaceutical companies,
Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt. said.  
 Unichem, based in Mumbai, is receiving increasing interest
from “several” multinational companies producing branded and
generic medicines for collaboration, the brokerage said in a
report on the pharmaceutical industry today. Tie-ups may be
announced in one to two months, B&K said. Unichem Chairman and
Managing Director  Prakash Mody  declined to comment.  
 Mergers and acquisitions will increase in India as
drugmakers seek new sources of revenue growth in emerging
markets, B&K said. India’s pharmaceutical market will expand at
least 13 percent annually over the next five years, helped by
increased spending on health care and rising rates of heart
disease, diabetes and cancer, according to the report.  
 “Several large MNCs have approached Unichem for stake
sale, but management is not keen to sell,” B&K analysts  Rohit Bhat ,  Sudarshan Padmanabhan  and  Gaurav Chugh  wrote in the
report. “They expect revenues to comfortably grow at 15-18
percent” annually for the next three to five years, the
analysts wrote.  
 Unichem  fell 2 percent to close at 458.9 rupees in Mumbai
trading today, valuing the company at $356 million. The stock
has climbed 108 percent since June 16 last year.  
 B&K  rates  Unichem “outperform” with a price target of 482
rupees a share.
