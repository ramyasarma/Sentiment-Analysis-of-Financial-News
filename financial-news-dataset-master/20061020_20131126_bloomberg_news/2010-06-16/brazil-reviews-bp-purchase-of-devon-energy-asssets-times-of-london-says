             Brazil’s oil-industry regulator is 
reviewing BP Plc’s $7 billion agreement to buy deep-water 
assets owned by Devon Energy Corp. of the U.S., the 
London-based Times reported.  
 The Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, which grants licenses and
supervises safety in the Brazilian oil industry, told the 
newspaper the transaction is being examined and no decision has
yet been taken on whether to approve it.  
 The purchase of Devon Energy assets in Brazil’s Campos and 
Camamu-Almada basins, which lie at depths of as much as 2,780 
meters (9,120 feet), as well as two onshore licenses in the 
Parnaiba basin, was announced on March 11.  
 Magda Chambriard, who heads the Brazilian watchdog, and 
Raphael Moura, the official responsible for safety issues, will
meet with BP in Houston next week for talks on the Deepwater 
Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, the newspaper said.  
 Spokesmen for both BP and Devon said yesterday there’s no 
indication that permission for the transaction, which also 
includes assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Azerbaijan, will be 
withheld, the Times added.
