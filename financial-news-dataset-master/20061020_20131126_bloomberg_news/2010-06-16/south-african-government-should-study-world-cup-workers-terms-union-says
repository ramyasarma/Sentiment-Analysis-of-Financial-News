             South Africa’s government should
“urgently” establish under what terms workers at the soccer
World Cup are employed to avoid any further strikes, according
to a labor union.  
 The South African Police Service yesterday said it was
taking over security at four of the 10 stadiums being used at
the 64-match tournament after guards working for a private
security company went on a wages strike.  
 The guards didn’t receive the conditions they were promised
by their employers, the South African Transport and Allied
Workers’ Union said today in an e-mailed statement.  
 “Action must be taken to enforce legal compliance before
the country is embarrassed further by unscrupulous companies,”
the Johannesburg-based union said.
