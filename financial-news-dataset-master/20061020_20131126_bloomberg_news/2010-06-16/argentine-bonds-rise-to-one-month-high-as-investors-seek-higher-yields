             Argentine dollar bonds advanced to
their highest price in a month as investors sought the South
American country’s higher-yielding securities.  
 The yield on dollar bonds due in 2015 slid 35 basis points,
or 0.35 percentage point, to 13.31 percent at 5:02 p.m. New York
time. The price climbed 1.17 cents to 78.08 cents on the dollar,
the highest level since May 17.  
 Bonds are advancing as the government’s offer to
restructure $18.3 billion in defaulted debt held out of a 2005
settlement nears its June 22 deadline.  
 “Argentina is still a favorite” among investors, said
 Siobhan Morden , a debt strategist with RBS Securities Inc. in
Stamford, Connecticut. “The debt swap is better to do than not
and yields are still high.”  
 Argentina’s restructuring offer includes warrants linked to
economic growth, as well as dollar bonds due in 2033 and bonds
due in 2017 to pay past-due interest. The offer doesn’t include
past-due payments on the GDP warrants.  
 Argentine Finance Secretary  Hernan Lorenzino  said at a
press conference in Milan today that he’s confident the swap
offer will be accepted by the holders of at least 60 percent of
defaulted notes. The deadline won’t be extended, he said.  
 Italy is home to up to $4 billion in defaulted bonds,
according to the Argentine government. Earlier this week
Lorenzino traveled to Tokyo where he met with Japanese bankers
and government officials.  
 Japanese Creditors  
 Japanese creditors have turned in 72 percent of remaining
defaulted samurai bonds and 82 percent of euro-yen notes held
out of the 2005 settlement, the Economy Ministry said in a
statement yesterday. That brings total participation by
creditors holding Japanese-law Argentina bonds to 99 percent,
the ministry said.  
 As of June 11, creditors tendered about 56 percent of the
outstanding bonds, Economy Ministry spokesman Sergio Poggi said
on June 14.  
 President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  opened the debt
swap May 3, five years after her husband and predecessor,  Nestor Kirchner , offered creditors about 30 cents on the dollar, the
harshest restructuring terms since at least World War II,
according to  Arturo Porzecanski , an international finance
professor at American University in Washington.  
 Argentina defaulted on $95 billion in 2001 and a successful
restructuring will help the country regain access to
international credit markets. It will also lower borrowing costs
for provinces and companies that seek to sell debt.  
 The peso was little changed at 3.9258 per dollar, from
3.9248 yesterday.
