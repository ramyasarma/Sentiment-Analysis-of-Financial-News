             Cablevision Systems Corp. , the New
York area cable-television provider, will use loans arranged by
Citigroup Inc. to finance its acquisition of Bresnan
Communications Co. from Providence Equity Partners Inc.,
according to a person familiar with the deal.  
 Bank of America Corp. will be the lead arranger on the bond
portion of the financing, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the transaction is private.  
 Bank of America and Citigroup have provided commitments for
the debt financing, Bethpage, New York-based Cablevision said
June 14 in a news statement.  
 Cablevision has agreed to buy Bresnan for $1.37 billion to
expand in the western U.S., according to the statement.  
 The deal will be financed with about $1 billion in non-
recourse debt and an equity investment by Cablevision of less
than $400 million, according to the statement.  
 Total leverage, or debt to Bresnan’s quarterly earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be
about six times,  Gregg Seibert , executive vice president of
Cablevision, said June 14 on a call for investors.  
 A message left for Seibert was not returned.
