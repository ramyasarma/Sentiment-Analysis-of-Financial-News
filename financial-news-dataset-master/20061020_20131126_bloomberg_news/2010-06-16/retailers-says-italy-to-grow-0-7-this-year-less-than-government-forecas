             Italy’s biggest retailers’ lobby
Confcommercio forecasts this year’s growth to be 0.7 percent,
and 1 percent in 2011, lower than government estimates,
according to the group’s chief, Carlo Sangalli.  
 Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s administration forecasts
that growth will be 1 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2011.
Italy’s budget adjustment of 25 billion euros ($30.7 billion)
over the next two years is based on the the government’s more
optimistic forecasts.  
 Sangalli, speaking today during his group’s annual assembly
in Rome, said that the government’s management of the public
accounts is “necessarily sober.” The retailers’ group
estimates that the real tax burden, calculated by including the
underground economy, amounts to 52 percent of gross domestic
product.
