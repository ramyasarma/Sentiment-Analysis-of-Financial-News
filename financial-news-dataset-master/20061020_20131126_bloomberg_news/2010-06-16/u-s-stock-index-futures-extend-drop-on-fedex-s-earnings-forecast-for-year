             Most U.S. stocks fell, with a late-
day rebound failing to extend yesterday’s rally in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index, after housing starts dropped and  FedEx
Corp. ’s profit forecast trailed estimates.  
 FedEx slid 6 percent after saying rising health-care and
pension costs will constrain earnings. Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac sank more than 38 percent as regulators ordered them to
delist their stock from exchanges.  BP Plc ’s U.S.  shares  rose 1.4
percent, triggering a short-lived rebound in energy shares that
briefly pushed the market higher, after agreeing to a $20
billion fund to pay damages from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 About three stocks fell for every two that rose on U.S.
exchanges. The  S&P 500  slipped 0.1 percent to 1,114.61 at 4 p.m.
in New York after climbing as much as 0.3 percent.  The Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 4.69 points, or less than 0.1 percent,
to 10,409.46.  
 “The market is trading on headline news and we’re all
focused on that underwater camera in the Gulf,” said  Frank Ingarra , a Stamford, Connecticut-based money manager at Hennessy
Advisors Inc., which oversees $800 million. “Investors are very
skittish and we continue to have our other big headlines.”  
 The S&P 500 rallied 2.4 percent yesterday to 1,115.23, the
highest since May 18. The advance sent the index about 6.5
points above its average level in the past 200 days, considered
significant by investors who base trading decisions on chart
patterns. The gauge remained above the trend line today.  
 Recovery After Tumble  
 The index tumbled 14 percent from a 19-month high on April
23 through June 7 as concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis will
derail the economic recovery and BP’s leaking well triggered the
worst oil spill in U.S. history. The S&P 500 has since rebounded
6.1 percent as concern over European budget deficits eased and
investors speculated growth in China and the U.S. will bolster
the global recovery.  
 FedEx  fell 6 percent to $78.07 for the biggest drop in the
S&P 500. The largest U.S. air-cargo carrier expects a fiscal
2011 profit of $4.40 to $5 a share. The average  estimate  of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of $5.07 a share.  
 “Sentiment right now is fairly negative,” said  Michael K. McCarty , managing partner at Differential Research LLC. “FedEx
is a good peek into the economy because they ship so much and
when they disappoint it confirms that the economy remains weak
across a broad sector of industries.”  
 BP  rose 1.4 percent to $31.85. The company will cancel
dividend payments for the first three quarters of the year and
has agreed to put about $20 billion into a fund to pay damages
resulting from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, with claims
administered by  Kenneth Feinberg , the lawyer who oversaw
executive compensation for the government’s financial bailout.  
 ‘Hard Numbers’  
 “It puts hard numbers around quantity,” said  Evan Smith ,
who helps manage $2 billion at U.S. Global Investors Inc.,
including shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., the company that
owns a 25 percent stake in BP’s well. “High estimates I’ve seen
have been $30 billion or $40 billion and this is less than that.
I’d imagine that’s incrementally positive.”  
 Energy stocks  fell 0.2 percent as a group among 10
industries in the S&P 500. The sector fell as much as 1.1
percent earlier.  
 Apple  rose 2.9 percent to $267.25. The world’s  most
valuable  technology company logged more than 600,000 early
orders for the iPhone 4 yesterday, a record, imposing a strain
on computer systems that prompted carrier  AT&T Inc.  to suspend
sales of the device before its June 24 debut.  
 Technology stocks  increased 0.2 percent, the third-biggest
gain after utility and health-care companies among 10 industries
in the S&P 500.  
 Washington Post  
 Three erroneous orders in  Washington Post Co.  shares
briefly caused the stock to double, making it the first U.S.
company to be halted by circuit breakers imposed following the
May 6 crash that erased $862 billion from equities in 20
minutes.  
 The trades  totaling  766 shares at $919.18 or $929.18
crossed on NYSE Euronext’s NYSE Arca electronic platform at
3:07:30 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compared with a price of $462.84 before the
jump. After the halt, it traded at $457.69 as of 3:46 p.m. The
transactions in question were later canceled, the data show.  
 Home Depot  
 Home Depot  lost 0.4 percent to $32.14. Housing starts fell
10 percent to a 593,000 annual rate last month, the lowest level
this year, from a revised 659,000 pace in April that was less
than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures showed.  
 The  S&P 500’s Consumer Discretionary Sector Index  dropped
0.6 percent for the biggest decline among 10 industry groups in
the benchmark index for U.S. equities.  
 Alcoa Inc. , the largest U.S. aluminum maker, fell the most
in the Dow, retreating 1.7 percent to $11.41.  
 “The market is driven by sentiment and what we see now is
all a continuum of the problems that exist inside the credit
system in particular,” said  Liam Dalton , who oversees $1.4
billion as president of Axiom Capital Management in New York.
“Expectations for corporate earnings are probably set too high
given that we see the economic data is beginning to slow.”  
 Analysts have lifted their average 2010 earnings growth
forecasts for the S&P 500 to about 32 percent from 26 percent at
the end of March.  
 Fannie Mae  shares tumbled 39 percent to 56 cents and
 Freddie Mac  plummeted 38 percent to 75 cents after regulators
told them to delist their common and preferred shares from the
New York Stock Exchange. The mortgage firms 80 percent-owned by
U.S. taxpayers will be quoted on the over-the-counter Bulletin
Board once they’re de-listed from the NYSE.  
 Sunoco Inc.  advanced the most in the S&P 500, gaining 6.3
percent to $34.27. The Philadelphia refinery said it will
separate SunCoke Energy from the remainder of Sunoco in the
first half of 2011 as part of a strategy designed to unlock
shareholder value.
