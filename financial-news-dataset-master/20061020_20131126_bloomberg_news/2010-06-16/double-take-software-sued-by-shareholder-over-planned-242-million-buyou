             Double-Take Software Inc. , a
provider of computer system protection services, was sued by a
shareholder who contends he’ll be shortchanged in a planned
$242 million buyout by Thoma Bravo LLC’s Vision Solutions Inc.  
 Double-Take, based in Southborough, Massachusetts, said May
17 it would be bought by Irvine, California-based Vision
Solutions for $10.55 a share in cash.  
 Directors of Double-Take “have an affirmative fiduciary
obligation to act in the best interests of the company’s
shareholders” and under the announced transaction, shareholders
“will not receive adequate or fair value for their common
stock,” investor Ian Wyer said today in a complaint in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington.  
 Double-Take reported $83.2 million in sales last year. Its
products help businesses recover critical data and applications,
with more than 19,000 customers worldwide, the company said in
its statement.  
 S. Craig Huke , Double-Take’s chief financial officer,
didn’t immediately return an e-mail message seeking comment on
the lawsuit.  
 Double-Take fell 2 cents to $10.40 at 4:30 p.m.in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading.  
 The case is Wyer v. Goodermote, CA5569, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).
