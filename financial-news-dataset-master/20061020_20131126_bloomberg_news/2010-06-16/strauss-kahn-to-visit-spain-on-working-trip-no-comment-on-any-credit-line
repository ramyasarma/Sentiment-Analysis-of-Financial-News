             International Monetary Fund Managing
Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said that he is going to Spain
on a working visit.  
 He declined to comment on a report that the IMF, the
European Union and the U.S. Treasury are putting together a
credit line of as much as 250 billion euros for the Spanish
government. The report appeared today in El Economista.
