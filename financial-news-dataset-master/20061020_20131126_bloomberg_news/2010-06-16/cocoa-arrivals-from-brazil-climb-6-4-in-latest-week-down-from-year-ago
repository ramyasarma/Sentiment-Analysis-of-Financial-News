             Cocoa arriving from Brazil’s Bahia,
the largest producing region, and other states gained to 95,215
bags in the week ended June 13, analyst Thomas Hartmann said.  
 The arrivals advanced 6.4 percent from 89,523 bags in the
week ended June 6, and were down 4.7 percent from the year-ago
figure of 99,891 bags, Brazil-based Hartmann wrote in an e-
mailed report for the Commercial Association of Bahia. Each bag
is 60 kilograms each.  
 “Whereas the fluctuation of the Bahia figure is within the
range of expectations, the low values from the other states
cause concern,” the report said. “Government sources argue
that the volumes of cocoa beans coming out of Para state might
be under-declared, which we are trying to investigate.”
