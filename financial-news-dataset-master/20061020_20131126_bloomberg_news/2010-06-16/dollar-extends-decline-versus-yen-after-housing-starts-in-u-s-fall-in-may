             The dollar extended its drop versus
the yen after a report showed builders broke ground on fewer
U.S. homes in May than anticipated. Housing starts fell 10
percent to a 593,000 annual rate last month, the lowest level
this year.  
 The dollar declined 0.3 percent to 91.17 yen from 91.46
yen.
