             Shareholders of Kuwait Finance &
Investment Co., an investment and asset management firm,
approved plans to sell rights shares to raise its capital to
54.15 million dinars.  
 The company will first reduce its capital to 34.15 million
dinars from 41.9 million dinars to absorb accumulated losses,
and then offer the rights shares to raise the capital, according
to the plan approved in Kuwait City today.
