             Brazil plans to extend until
December tax cuts on the sale of trucks, tractors and pick-up
trucks to boost sales, a government official familiar with the
decision said.  
 The tax cut is being extended because truck sales haven’t
rebounded as fast as passenger car sales, said the government
official, who asked not to be identified because the measure
hasn’t been announced.  
 Brazil first cut taxes on vehicle sales in December 2008 to
shore up domestic demand amid the global financial crisis. The
government has dialed back tax breaks and raised interest rates
twice this year after domestic demand pushed inflation over the
government’s 4.5 percent target and fueled 9 percent growth in
the first quarter, the  fastest  in 15 years.  
 Brazil sold 51,972 trucks in the first four months of the
year, up from 30,120 in the same period a year ago, according to
figures by the country’s automaker association. Sales are up 36
percent when compared with the same period two years ago, before
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.  
 Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said last November that he
would leave the this fiscal stimulus on truck sales in place for
another six months to renew the country’s aging truck fleet,
which has an average age of 18 years, and improve air quality.  
 Consumer prices  rose 5.22 percent in the 12 months through
May. Inflation has exceeded the target in every month this year.
