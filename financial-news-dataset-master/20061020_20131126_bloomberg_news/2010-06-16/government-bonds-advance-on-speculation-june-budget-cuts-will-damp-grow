             U.K. government bonds rose,
narrowing the extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of German bunds, on speculation government
plans to narrow the budget deficit will damp economic growth.  
 The benchmark 10-year gilt snapped two days of declines
after the Nationwide Building Society said consumer confidence
dropped in May by the most since July 2008. Bonds of Europe’s
so-called peripheral nations fell after a report in a Spanish
newspaper, denied by the European Union and International
Monetary Fund, said Spain is set to receive a 250 billion-euro
($307 billion) credit line. Britain’s Debt Management Office
sold 550 million pounds ($812 million) of index-linked bonds due
in 2017 today.  
 “It’s bullish for gilts if you have stronger fiscal
consolidation,” said  Mohit Kumar , a fixed-income strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in London. “Today’s rally is also fueled by
broader risk aversion.”  
 The 10-year gilt yield fell six basis points to 3.49
percent as of 1:37 p.m. in London. The 4.75 percent security due
in March 2020 gained 0.54, or 5.4 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 110.32. The yield  premium  over German bunds narrowed
three basis points to 85 basis points, the least since May 3,
based on closing prices.  
 Two-year note yields fell five basis points to 0.81
percent.  
 The U.K. 10-year swap spread turned positive for the first
time since May 10. A positive swap spread means the gilt yield
is lower than the swap rate. It reached 0.59 basis point before
moving back to negative 0.27 basis point.  
 Emergency Budget  
 Spanish and Portuguese debt premiums to bunds widened
today. The European Union today “firmly” denied a report
published in newspaper El Economista that said the International
Monetary Fund, the EU and the U.S. Treasury are putting together
a credit line for the Spanish government.  
 Gilts outperformed bunds, narrowing the 10-year spread from
a four-and-a-half year high of 103 basis points on May 7. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  formed a coalition government last month
and said he planned to tackle the nation’s deficit sooner than
 Gordon Brown ’s previous Labour administration.  
 Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is set to
outline spending cuts in an emergency budget on June 22. While
limiting economic growth, Kumar said deeper cuts by Osborne may
also help the U.K. avoid the rising bond yields afflicting Spain
and Portugal.  
 The sovereign-debt crisis risks spreading to Britain unless
decisive steps are taken to rein in the deficit, former Bank of
England policy maker  DeAnne Julius  said.  
 ‘Tides Shift’  
 “We’re living in a world economy where there are massive
pools of liquidity and the tides shift, and they usually shift
to target the weakest link,” Julius said in a Bloomberg
Television interview in London today. “The risk that this
economy and the U.S. faces is that unless we get control of our
debt burden, we could be in line at some point as well.”  
 Bonds stayed higher even after a report showed U.K.
unemployment fell in the quarter through April and jobless
benefits dropped last month by more than economists forecast.  
 Unemployment measured by International Labour Organization
methods slipped to 2.472 million people from 2.51 million in the
first quarter, the Office for National Statistics said today in
London. The number of people claiming jobless benefits dropped
30,900, exceeding the median forecast of 25 economists for a
decline of 20,000.  
 The U.K. sold 550 million pounds of index-linked bonds
maturing in 2017. Consumer prices increased 3.4 percent from a
year earlier in May, compared with 3.7 percent in April, the
Office for National Statistics said yesterday.  
 Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.4779 and was 0.4 percent
stronger at 83.01 pence per euro.
