             India’s  central bank  may refrain
from raising its benchmark rate before a July 27 meeting as
 money-market  rates have already climbed following license-fee
payments by phone companies, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  
 “We are not convinced that there will be an inter-meeting
hike, given the recent significant tightening of liquidity
conditions,” Nomura economists  Sonal Varma  and Ketaki Sharma
wrote in a June 15 research note.  
 Banks borrowed an average 384 billion rupees a day ($8.3
billion) from the central bank through its  repurchase-auction
window  this month, reflecting a shortage of funds. Last month,
they lent a daily average of 328 billion rupees of surplus cash
to the RBI. The companies that won permits to provide third-
generation services last month paid 677.2 billion rupees to the
government.  
 The yield on the  7.80 percent note  due May 2020 rose 20
basis points to 7.66 percent over the past week as investors
speculated an increase in policy rates after  industrial output 
growth approached the fastest pace in 16 years. Production rose
17.6 percent in April, just short of the 17.7 percent increase
achieved in December.  
 The benchmark  wholesale-price index  advanced 10.16 percent
in May from a year earlier, after a 9.59 percent gain in the
previous month, the commerce ministry said on June 14.  
 The Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates twice
since mid-March, by a quarter-percentage point each time. The
reverse-repurchase auction rate, or the rate at which the
central bank absorbs surplus cash, is 3.75 percent, while the
repurchase auction rate is 5.25 percent.
