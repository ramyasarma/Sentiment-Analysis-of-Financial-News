             Palm Inc., maker of the Treo e-mail
phone, will post an unexpected second-quarter loss after sales
missed its forecast because of delays in shipping a product. The
shares fell 17 percent in  late trading .  
 The loss totaled 8 cents to 10 cents a share, before some
costs, Palm said today in a statement. Revenue fell to as little
as $345 million in the period ended Nov. 30. Analysts on average
anticipated a 4-cent profit and $378.2 million in sales,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Palm, facing new competition from  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) 's
BlackBerry and Apple Inc.'s iPhone, failed to get a key product
certified for delivery in the quarter, Chief Executive Officer
Ed Colligan said in the statement. Higher warranty-repair costs
and increased demand for lower-priced products cut into profit,
the Sunnyvale, California-based company said.  
 ``There have been market share losses for Palm and this
increases the concerns,'' said  Lawrence Harris , an analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, who has a neutral rating on the
stock. ``We do need to see replacements for the traditional Treo
line.''  
 Palm dropped $1.10 to $5.49 in extended trading. The stock,
which has lost more than half its value this year, gained 27
cents to $6.59 as of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .  
 Palm spokeswoman Jennifer Stryd-Donahue declined to
identify the delayed product.  
 Second Loss  
 The announcement marked the  second straight  loss since
buyout firm Elevation Partners agreed to acquire a 25 percent
stake in the company in June. Palm hired  Jon Rubinstein , who was
head of Apple's iPod business, as executive chairman as part of
the Elevation arrangement.  
 In October, Palm predicted profit, excluding costs such as
stock-based compensation, of 6 cents to 8 cents a share on sales
of as much as $380 million.  
 Palm's profitability suffered after the company sold
cheaper devices to appeal to a younger and broader audience.
Sprint Nextel Corp. started offering Palm's $99 Centro device
last quarter, and sales of the device have been higher than
expected, the company said today. The Treo typically costs $199
with a monthly contract.  
 Gross margin, the percentage of sales left after deducting
the costs of production, was as little as 29.5 percent in the
second quarter, down from a previous prediction of at least 33.5
percent, the company said. Those figures exclude costs such as
stock-based compensation.  
 Trailing BlackBerry  
 Palm has been slower than Waterloo, Ontario-based Research
In Motion at updating its designs. Product delays also caused
Palm to miss its forecast in the same quarter last year. In
September, the company canceled plans to sell a portable
computer.  
 In the second quarter of last year, Palm reported net
income of $12.8 million, or 12 cents a share, on sales of $392.9
million.  
 Sales at Research In Motion, which has introduced new video
and music devices this year including the Curve, probably
doubled last quarter to $1.65 billion, according to  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Cupertino, California-based Apple sold
more than 1.4 million iPhones from June through the end of
September.  
 ``It's getting increasingly competitive in the smartphone
market,'' Harris said. ``It will take time before Rubinstein and
the new team brings new products to market.''
