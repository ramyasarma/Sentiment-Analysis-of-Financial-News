U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains after jobless claims increased more than forecast and
worker productivity topped estimates.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month rallied 0.9 percent to 1,207.3 at 8:35 a.m. in New York.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 85 points, or 0.8
percent, to 11,262.  Jobless claims rose by 20,000 to 457,000 last week, Labor
Department figures showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists called for an increase of 442,000. A
measure of employee output increased at a 1.9 percent annual
rate after falling 1.8 percent in the previous three months, the
Labor Department said. Economists had projected a 1 percent gain
in a survey.  Stocks rose yesterday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to its highest closing level since the week Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in September 2008,
as the Federal Reserve announced plans to buy an additional $600
billion in bonds to pump cash into the economy.       Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is using tools devised during
the financial crisis to add fuel to an economy that’s been
expanding for 15 months. Bernanke’s Fed is constrained by a key
interest rate near zero and bound by a Congressional mandate to
reduce unemployment.  The Labor Department may say tomorrow that the unemployment
rate was 9.6 percent in October for a third month, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
jobless rate peaked at 10.1 percent a year ago, the highest
since 1983.   Economists predict that private payrolls, which exclude
government agencies, rose by 80,000 last month, the survey
showed. That compares with an increase of 64,000 in September
and a loss of 806,000 non-government positions in January 2009
at the depths of the recession and President George W. Bush’s
final month in office. Private payrolls have grown every month
this year.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
