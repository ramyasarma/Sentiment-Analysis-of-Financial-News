BTG Plc , which makes an experimental
varicose-vein treatment called Varisolve, said first-half profit
fell 41 percent as marketing and sales costs rose.  Net income fell to 2.4 million pounds ($3.9 million) for
the six months to Sept. 30, from 4.1 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement
distributed by the Regulatory News Service.  Sales and marketing costs were 3.1 million pounds, against
1.4 million a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.8 percent to 46.1
million pounds.  “For the first time, we are marketing and selling our own
products in the U.S.,” Chief Executive Officer  Louise Makin 
said in the statement. “We have commenced the Phase III trials
of Varisolve and we have seen significant positive developments
in our partnered programs.”  BTG is looking to its poisoning remedies, CroFab and
DigiFab, to replace royalty revenue from products facing the
loss of patent protection such as the hemophilia drug Benefix.
The company has been named as a possible buyer for
 Biocompatibles International Plc , which is in advanced talks
with an unidentified party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
