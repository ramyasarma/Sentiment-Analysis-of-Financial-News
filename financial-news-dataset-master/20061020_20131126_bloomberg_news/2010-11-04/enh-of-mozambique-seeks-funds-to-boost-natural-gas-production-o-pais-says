Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos,
Mozambique’s state oil company, is seeking $400 million to
increase natural-gas production at the Pande/Temane field, O
Pais reported, citing company officials it didn’t identify.  ENH wants to boost output to 163 million gigajoules per
year from 120 million, the Maputo-based newspaper said.  ENH Chief Executive Officer Nelson Ocuane didn’t answer his
