European stocks  rose to a six-month
high after the Federal Reserve announced $600 billion of
additional bond purchases and earnings from BNP Paribas SA and
Unilever topped estimates.  BNP Paribas rose 3.7 percent after France’s biggest bank
reported a bigger-than-estimated jump in profit. Unilever soared
5.5 percent after the company also reported volume growth that
beat analysts’ estimates. BHP Billiton Ltd. jumped 6.6 percent
to a record high in London after Canada blocked its $40 billion
hostile takeover for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 1.6 percent to 270.83 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in London, its highest level since April 15.
The rally brings the measure’s gain since its low this year in
May to 17 percent. European stocks retreated yesterday as
investors waited to hear if the Fed would restart its program of
asset purchases to bolster the economy, a strategy known as
quantitative easing.  “A large number of more leveraged investors are using QE
as the argument to put money to work before the end of the
year,” said Edinburgh-based  Andrew Milligan , head of global
strategy at Standard Life investments, in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. “This has been a long time coming.”  ‘Extended Period’  The Fed said new purchases will be about $75 billion a
month through June and it will “adjust the program as needed.”
Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted policy makers
would add at least $500 billion to the financial system. The
central bank also left unchanged its pledge to keep interest
rates low for an “extended period.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in all of the 18 western
European markets today except Portugal and Greece. The U.K.’s
FTSE 100 Index gained 2 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index increased
1.9 percent and Germany’s DAX Index climbed 1.8 percent.  The Bank of England today kept its bond-purchase plan at
200 billion pounds ($325.5 billion) after pausing the program in
February and left its interest rate at a record low. The
European Central Bank, which has said it intends to continue
withdrawing its emergency stimulus measures, also today kept
interest rates at a record low of 1 percent.  About 63 percent of the companies on the Stoxx 600 that
have announced results since Oct. 7 have  beaten analyst
estimates  for per-share income, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In the U.S., 77 percent of S&P 500 companies have
topped predictions in the period.  BNP, Unilever  BNP Paribas rose 3.7 percent to 54.37 euros after the
Paris-based lender reported a 46 percent increase in third-
quarter profit to 1.91 billion euros ($2.7 billion), helped by
its consumer-banking networks in France, Belgium and the U.S.
 That beat  the 1.75 billion-euro average estimate of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The jump in retail earnings more than
offset lower corporate- and investment-banking profit.  Unilever rallied 5.5 percent to 22.48 euros in Amsterdam as
the world’s second-biggest consumer products maker reported a 19
percent rise in third-quarter net income to 1.25 billion euros,
beating the 1.18 billion-euro average analyst estimate.  So-called underlying volume grew 4.8 percent which also
topped the median analyst estimate of 4.4 percent.  Investor Opposition  BHP, the world’s largest mining company, rallied 6.6
percent to 2,430 pence, the highest price on record. The
Canadian government yesterday said the sale of Potash wouldn’t
provide a “net benefit” to the nation. BHP Chief Executive
Officer  Marius Kloppers  obtained $45 billion of loans in
September to fund the proposed $130 a share acquisition, which
has met opposition from politicians and investors. The company
has 30 days to lodge an appeal.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. Ltd. jumped 6.4 percent to 50.5 Swiss
francs after the world’s second-largest reinsurer agreed to
repay  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as third quarter
profit doubled to $618 million. That beat the average analyst
estimate of $484 million.  Swiss Re aims to regain its AA credit rating, which
Standard & Poor’s cut in February 2009 after record losses
forced the company to raise 3 billion francs ($3.1 billion) of
capital from Buffett.  HeidelbergCement AG  surged 8.9 percent to 40.95 euros after
the world’s third-largest maker of cement and concrete more than
doubled third-quarter profit to 322 million euros as sales rose
to 3.4 billion euros. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had
expected net income of 258 million euros from sales of 3.34
billion euros.  Man Group, Zurich  Man Group Plc  soared 15 percent to 290.8 pence, its largest
gain since April 2009. The biggest publicly traded hedge-fund
manager posted per-share earnings for the first half of 10.2
cents, topping a 9.5 cents a share projection from its trading
statement on Sept 28.  Zurich Financial Services AG  fell 1.5 percent to 238.2
francs after reporting a 22 percent drop in third-quarter profit
to $751 million after Switzerland’s largest insurer settled a
U.S. class action lawsuit. Earnings missed the $777 million
average analyst estimate.  Deutsche Telekom AG  slipped 1.7 percent to 10.27 euros
after Europe’s largest telecommunications company reported lower
third-quarter operating profit of 5.02 billion euros as the
company had higher costs to win U.S. clients.  Analysts had estimated operating profit of 5.09 billion
euros. Sales slid to 6.32 billion euros from 6.47 billion euros.  Rolls-Royce Group Plc  dropped 5 percent to 621.5 pence
after Qantas Airways Ltd. grounded its Airbus SAS A380 fleet
after an engine exploded in mid-flight, forcing an emergency
landing in Singapore earlier today. European Aeronautic Defence
& Space Co., the parent of planemaker Airbus SAS, lost 4.1
percent to 18.26 euros.  Cable & Wireless Communications Plc  plummeted 13 percent to
46.99 pence, the biggest drop since October 2005. The company
reported profit and sales that missed estimates and analysts
called the company’s cash flow “miniscule.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
