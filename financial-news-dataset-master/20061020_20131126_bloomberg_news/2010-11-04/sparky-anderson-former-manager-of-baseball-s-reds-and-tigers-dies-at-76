Sparky Anderson , the first manager in
Major League Baseball history to win World Series titles in both
leagues, has died. He was 76.  Anderson died today from complications of dementia,
according to a statement from Dan Ewald, a family spokesman. The
family said yesterday that Anderson had been placed in hospice
care at his home in Thousand Oaks, California.  Anderson led the Cincinnati Reds to World Series titles in
1975-76 and then turned in a 17-year stint with the Detroit
Tigers, where he set a franchise record with 1,331 and won the
Series in 1984.  Anderson had a career record of 2,194-1,834 losses with the
Reds and Tigers from 1970 to 1995. He ranks sixth all-time in
wins and was inducted into the National Baseball  Hall of Fame  in
2000.  Anderson received the nickname “Captain Hook” for his
frequent pitching changes, a practice that has become standard
in baseball today, according to the Hall of Fame’s website. He
won Manager of the Year awards twice with the Tigers.  George Lee Anderson was born Feb. 22, 1934, in Bridgewater,
South Dakota.  During his playing career, he spent  10 seasons  in
baseball’s minor leagues, developing a reputation as a good-
fielding middle infielder who couldn’t hit.  Anderson played one season in the majors as the
Philadelphia Phillies’ starting second baseman in 1959, when he
hit .218 in  152 games  with no home runs and 34 runs batted in.  Cooke Encouragement  Anderson returned to the minors for the next four seasons,
playing for the Triple-A Toronto Maple Leafs in the
International League. Anderson was encouraged to pursue a
managerial career by Leafs owner  Jack Kent Cooke , who also owned
football’s Washington Redskins, basketball’s Los Angeles Lakers
and hockey’s Los Angeles Kings.  Anderson took over the Maple Leafs in 1964 at the age of 30
and spent five seasons in the minors before joining the San
Diego Padres’ coaching staff in 1969. The following year,
Anderson was hired in Cincinnati and led the Reds to 102 wins
and a  National League pennant  in his first season as manager.  Cincinnati lost the World Series to five games to the
Baltimore Orioles that season and two years later lost in seven
games to the Oakland Athletics.  In 1975, Anderson’s Reds won 108 games, swept the NL
championship series and beat the Boston Red Sox for the World
Series in seven games. They successfully defended their title in
1976, winning 102 games and sweeping the New York Yankees in the
World Series.  Anderson was fired by the Reds in 1978 after consecutive
second-place finishes and joined the Tigers in 1979.  He won the first of his two American League Manager of the
Year awards in 1984, when the Tigers had a major league-record
35-5 start to the season, set a franchise mark with 104 wins and
beat the Padres in the World Series.  Anderson wears a Reds uniform on his Hall of Fame plaque.
The Reds retired his No. 10 jersey in 2005 and the No. 11 he
wore in Detroit has been inactive since his retirement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
