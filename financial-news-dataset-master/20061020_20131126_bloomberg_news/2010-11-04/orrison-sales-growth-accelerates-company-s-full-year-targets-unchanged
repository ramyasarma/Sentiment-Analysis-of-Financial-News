William Morrison Supermarkets Plc ,
the smallest of the U.K.’s four main food retailers, said sales
growth accelerated in the third quarter and left its full-year
outlook unchanged.  Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1.3 percent
excluding gasoline and value-added tax in the 13 weeks through
Oct. 31, the Bradford, England-based company said today in a
statement. That compares with the first-half’s 0.9 percent gain.
Morrison said sales are “in line with our expectations,” and
the financial outlook for 2010 “remains unchanged.”  Chief Executive Officer  Dalton Philips  said in September
that he’s considering convenience stores, an online food
offering and more own-label products to overcome “low market
growth.” British grocers offered record levels of promotions in
September as inflation buoyed languishing sales growth, Nielsen
market research said.  “Food trading volumes remain quiet in the U.K. at
present,”  Clive Black , an analyst at Shore Capital said in a
report before the release. “Strong growth is anticipated from
here on,” he said. Black has a “buy” rating on the stock.  Annual pretax profit will increase to 863.5 million pounds
($1.39 billion) this year, according to the average estimate of
24 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Morrison shares fell 1.8 pence, or 0.6 percent, to 290
pence in London trading yesterday. The stock has gained 4.5
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
