Cap Gemini SA , Europe’s largest
computer-services company, fell the most in more than 19 months
in Paris trading after Chief Financial Officer  Nicolas Dufourcq 
said sales growth is likely to be at the low end of forecasts.  Cap Gemini dropped as much as 6.6 percent to 34.18 euros,
the  biggest  intraday decline since March 27, 2009, and was down
3.9 percent as of 12:17 p.m.  After a forecast in July of 3 percent to 5 percent growth
in second-half revenue, excluding acquisitions or disposals, the
lower number “is something which I would say is in the bank,”
Dufourcq said today on a conference call with analysts. A gain
of as much as 5 percent “is probably now not achievable.”  Computer-services companies are betting that the global
economic recovery will drive companies to make information
technology investments they deferred during the recession.
Providers including Infosys Technologies Ltd. and Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. have signaled they’re receiving rising
demand from corporate clients.  Third-quarter sales rose 8.2 percent to 2.11 billion euros
($3 billion), with revenue at existing divisions and excluding
currency effects increasing 2.5 percent, Cap Gemini said today.
Bookings in the quarter rose 15 percent to 2.18 billion euros.
Paris-based Cap Gemini reiterated a target of a full-year
operating margin exceeding 6.5 percent of sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
