U.K. government departments have a
poor record of finding efficiency savings and may instead cut
deeper into the services they provide to reduce spending,
lawmakers said.  The efficiency drive started in 2008 has failed to yield
the desired results, Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee said
in a report published today. As of March this year, departments
had reported 15 billion pounds ($24 billion) of savings out of a
target of 35 billion pounds by April 2011, the panel said.  “My committee is gravely concerned about the ability of
government to make efficiency improvements on the scale
needed,” said Chairwoman  Margaret Hodge . “There is a serious
risk that, to reduce costs, departments will rely solely on
cutting front-line services.”  Department face cuts of 19 percent on average over the next
four years as the government seeks to narrow the deficit to 2
percent of economic output by 2015 from more than 10 percent
today. Prime Minister  David Cameron  has asked ministers to step
up the search for savings to minimize the impact on services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
