Brazil’s real climbed to the
strongest in two weeks as prices for commodities increased to
the highest level in since 2008 after the Federal Reserve
announced it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries.  The real advanced 1.1 percent to 1.6708 per dollar, from
1.6898 yesterday, extending its gain this year to 4.4 percent.
It climbed to 1.6690 per dollar earlier today, the strongest
level since Oct. 18.  Raw sugar for March delivery reached 31.81 cents a pound at
ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the highest level for a most-
active contract since Jan. 9, 1981. Brazil is the world’s
largest supplier of the sweetener. Oil rose for a fourth day,
gaining 2.1 percent to $86.49 per barrel. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index climbed 2.4 percent
to 312.30, the highest level since Oct. 7, 2008.  “The Brazilian real’s trade balance has a very high
dependence on commodity prices, so through the external channel
we have this connection between the real and commodities,” said
 Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP Paribas in Sao
Paulo.  The 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, including the
real, rose today versus the greenback on concern the Fed’s move
may flood the economy with dollars, debasing the world’s reserve
currency. The real’s gain trailed a 1.9 percent rise in New
Zealand’s dollar and 1.2 percent increase in the pound.  Tripled the Tax  The real lost 0.7 percent last month, the biggest decline
since May, after the government tripled the tax on foreign
fixed-income investors to 6 percent to curb the currency’s
appreciation. The government also raised the levy on foreigners
investing in local derivatives to 6 percent from 0.38 percent.  “It’s interesting to see the real’s appreciation isn’t
that significant compared with other currencies,” Donadio said
in a phone interview. “This is naturally due to the
expectations that the government can come to the market and
announce more measures to curb its appreciation.”  Brazil isn’t considering additional currency measures as
the country is managing to control the real’s gains, Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters today in Brasilia.  The comments came after O Globo reported earlier this week
that the government may raise the tax it charges foreigners on
some investments for the third time since the beginning of
October. The report didn’t say where it obtained the
information.  Brazil received net dollar inflows of $6.9 billion in
October, compared with $13.7 billion the previous month, the
central bank said today.  The yield on Brazil’s interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to
11.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
