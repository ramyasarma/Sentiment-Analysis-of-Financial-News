Chicago, whose credit ranking has
been cut by Fitch Ratings twice in less than three months, is
delaying next week’s $804 million bond sale, said Pete Scales, a
spokesman for Chief Financial Officer  Gene Saffold .  The sale, which includes $591 million in tax-exempt
refinancing bonds and almost $214 million in taxable Build
Americas, will bring the total general obligations sold by the
city this year to about $1.75 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The city sold $690 million in 2009.  “We have decided to postpone the GO bond sale to wait for
a more opportune time to access the lowest possible rates,”
Scales said in an e-mail. “A new sale date hasn’t yet been
determined.”  The third most-populous U.S. city had its general-
obligation debt downgraded one level to AA-, Fitch’s fourth-
highest, last week. It was cut to AA on Aug. 5, when the rating
company cited declining tax revenue and the use of reserves to
balance the city’s budget. The city is rated fourth-highest by
Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s at Aa3 and AA-.  To contact the reporter on this story:
