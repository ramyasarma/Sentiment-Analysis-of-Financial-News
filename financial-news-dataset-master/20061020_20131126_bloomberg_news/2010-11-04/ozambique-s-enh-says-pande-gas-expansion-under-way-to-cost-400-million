Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos,
Mozambique’s state oil company, said a $400 million project to
increase natural-gas production from the nation’s Pande and
Temane fields is under way and scheduled for completion in 2011.  ENH, which owns 25 percent of the field and invested $100
million, aims to boost output from 120 million gigajoules a year
to 183 million, Chief Executive Officer  Nelson Ocuane  told
reporters at an oil conference in Cape Town today.  Sasol Ltd. , the world’s largest producer of motor fuel from
coal, owns half the gas venture, with the South African
government holding the remaining 25 percent. Gas is transported
from the fields to South Africa via an 865-kilometer (536-mile)
pipeline.  Work has also begun on a $150 million project to expand the
pipeline due for completion in 2011, Ocuane said at the Africa
Upstream conference.  The construction of a separate pipeline to distribute gas
to the capital Mputo and the industrial city of Matola is
scheduled to begin next year and should take between eight and
12 months, he said.  The Pande gas field was discovered in 1962 while the first
oil exploration in Mozambique began in 1904. A civil war between
independence from Portugal in 1975 and 1991 hampered
exploration.  ENH plans to begin seismic studies on the Buzi gas deposits
in the central Sofala province by early next year, and expects a
first well to be drilled in 2012, Ocuane said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
