U.S. bank stocks  rose the most in two
months after the Wall Street Journal said the Federal Reserve is
expected to allow lenders with satisfactory capital levels to
increase  dividend  payments.  Bank of America Corp. and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, led the KBW Bank Index to a 3.6
percent gain at 4:01 p.m. in New York. The increase was the
largest since Sept. 1. Eighty of the 81 companies in the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Financial Index  also advanced.  Regulators are expected to soon provide banks with
requirements they must meet to raise the dividends, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said last month
that he hoped to increase the dividend early next year.  Bank of America jumped 5.2 percent to $12.12, after
climbing as much as 6.3 percent, its biggest intraday gain since
May. JPMorgan rose 5.5 percent to $39.80. SunTrust Banks Inc.,
BB&T Corp. and  US Bancorp  all climbed more than 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
