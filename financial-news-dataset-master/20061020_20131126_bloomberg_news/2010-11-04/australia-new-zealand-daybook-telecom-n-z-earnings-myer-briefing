An overview of activity since markets
closed in Sydney and a preview of the day ahead.  
Market action since Sydney’s end of day:  EQUITIES New York: U.S. stocks rose, sending the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index briefly above its highest close in more than
two years, as investors speculated the Federal Reserve will
succeed in stoking growth and corporate earnings improved.
*Time Warner Cable Inc., the second-largest U.S. cable operator,
advanced 4.9 percent as it announced a $4 billion share-buyback
plan and announced higher-than-estimated earnings.
*The S&P 500 rose 1.4 percent to 1,214.79 at 2:07 p.m. in New
York, after climbing to 1,217.52 earlier, above its highest end-
of-day level since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.’s bankruptcy in September 2008.
*The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 171.84 points, or 1.5
percent, to 11,386.97.  London: European stocks rose to a six-month high after the
Federal Reserve announced $600 billion of additional bond
purchases and earnings from BNP Paribas SA and Unilever topped
estimates.
*BNP Paribas rose 3.7 percent after France’s biggest bank
reported a bigger-than-estimated jump in profit. Unilever soared
5.5 percent after the company also reported volume growth that
beat analysts’ estimates. BHP Billiton Ltd. jumped 6.6 percent
to a record high in London after Canada blocked its $40 billion
hostile takeover for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
*The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.6 percent to 270.83 at the
5:30 p.m. close in London, its highest level since April 15. The
rally brings the measure’s gain since its low this year in May
to 17 percent.  Tokyo: Asian stocks rose, propelling a benchmark index to the
highest level in more than two years, after the U.S. Federal
Reserve expanded measures to boost the world’s largest economy.
*Canon Inc., which gets 27 percent of its sales in the Americas,
jumped 2.9 percent in Tokyo. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest mining company, surged 2.6 percent in Sydney after
Canadian regulators blocked its acquisition of Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc.

markets resumed trading after a holiday.  Sydney/Wellington: Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.5
percent to 4,745.30 as at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in
Sydney.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  New York: The dollar fell against most of its major peers as the
European Central Bank signaled it likely will stick with its
stimulus-exit strategy even as the Federal Reserve buys $600
billion of bonds to boost the U.S. economy.
*The greenback reached a nine-month low versus the euro as the
ECB said it will decide on possible further exit steps next
month.

in New York, from $1.4139 yesterday. It earlier reached $1.4282,
the weakest since Jan. 20.
*Against the yen, the dollar lost 0.5 percent to 80.68.  TREASURIES  New York: Treasury notes rose, pushing yields on two- and five-
year securities to record lows, a day after the Federal Reserve
said it will focus its $600 billion in asset purchases through
June on medium-maturity debt.
*The yield on the 30-year bond touched a three-month high after
the central bank said yesterday it will buy fewer longer-term
securities than analysts had expected.
*U.S. notes remained higher as the $10 billion auction of 10-
year inflation-indexed debt produced a record low yield of 0.409
percent.
*The yield on the 30-year bond was little changed at 4.04
percent after touching 4.0910 percent, the highest since July 29.  COMMODITIES  METALS  New York: Copper rose to the highest price in 28 months as the

money to bolster the U.S. economy.

percent, to $3.91 a pound at 11:01 a.m. on the Comex in New

most-active contract since July 3, 2008.  GOLD  New York: Gold surged the most since March 2009 and silver rose
to a 30-year high after the Federal Reserve said it will buy
more debt, driving the dollar lower and boosting demand for
precious metals as alternative investments.
*Gold futures for December delivery rose $40.30, or 3 percent,
to $1,377.90 an ounce at 12:02 p.m. on the Comex in New York. A
close at that price would mark the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since March 19, 2009.  OIL  New York: Oil rose to the highest level in six months in New
York as the dollar tumbled after the Federal Reserve expanded
bond purchases to spur the economy in the U.S., the world’s
biggest crude consumer.
