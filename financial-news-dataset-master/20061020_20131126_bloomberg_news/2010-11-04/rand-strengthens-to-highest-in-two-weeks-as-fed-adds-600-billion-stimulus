The rand rallied to an almost three-
week high versus the dollar after the Federal Reserve expanded
its monetary stimulus program to boost the world’s biggest
economy, stoking demand for higher-yielding assets.  South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 2.1 percent
to 6.7683 per dollar, the strongest level since Oct. 15. The
rand traded 1.7 percent stronger at 6.7972 by 4:07 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 6.9125.  The Fed’s Open Market Committee said late yesterday that it
will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June
to bolster economic growth, more than the $500 billion predicted
in a Bloomberg survey. The FOMC kept its  benchmark interest rate 
target for overnight interbank loans at zero to 0.25 percent,
where it has been since December 2008.  “This is an emerging-markets move more than a rand move
that is being driven by dollar weakness,”  Leon Myburgh , a
fixed-income and currency strategist for sub-Saharan Africa at
Citigroup Inc., said by telephone from Johannesburg. “The Fed
meeting and the quantitative-easing program that was announced
supports the view for a weaker dollar, and is likely to fuel
carry-trade flows to emerging markets over the long term.”  The rand has rallied 38 percent against the dollar since
the start of 2009 as near-zero interest rates in developed
nations encouraged investors to borrow cheaply there to invest
in higher-yielding emerging markets. South Africa’s  6 percent 
benchmark interest rate, which compares with deposit returns as
low as 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25 percent in the U.S., makes
the rand a popular purchase in this strategy, which is known by
traders as the carry trade.  Government bonds in South Africa rose for the fifth time in
six days, with the benchmark 13.5 percent government security
due September 2015 adding 39 cents, the most since Oct. 28, to
126.80 rand. The yield on the bond fell 8 basis points to 6.90
percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the security
in November 2004. A basis point is 0.1 percentage point.  Against the euro, the rand added 0.2 percent to 9.6900,
while it appreciated 0.6 percent versus the pound to 11.0522.  To contact the reporter on this story:
