U.S. jobs data tomorrow may show an
increase in payrolls, stemming the dollar’s declines, after the
Federal Reserve indicated yesterday its asset purchases will
depend on how the economy performs, Standard Bank Plc said.  “The risks to payrolls tomorrow lie to the upside,” Steve Barrow , head of research for Group-of-10 currencies, said today
in a research note. “If we are right, this could put at least a
temporary block on dollar weakness and bond-market strength.  ‘‘Economic data is going to be important,’’ Barrow wrote.
‘‘But there is a danger here that the market attaches too much
importance to the data, thinking that strong numbers will cause
the Fed to stop when, in fact, nothing could be further from the
truth,’’ he said.  The Fed’s lack of clarity of its objectives for inflation
and unemployment ‘‘leaves the market groping in the dark a
bit,’’ Barrow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
