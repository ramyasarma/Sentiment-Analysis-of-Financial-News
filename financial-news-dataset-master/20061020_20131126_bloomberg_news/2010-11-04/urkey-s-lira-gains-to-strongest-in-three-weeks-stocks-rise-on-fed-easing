Turkey’s lira rose to the highest in
three weeks after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it will expand
asset purchases by $600 billion to boost the world’s largest
economy.  The lira advanced as much as 0.7 percent to 1.3943 at 12:07
p.m., the strongest intraday level since Oct. 14. It depreciated
0.3 percent to 1.9908 per euro.  Turkish stocks also rallied on the Fed’s plan to revive
U.S. demand, sending the ISE National 100 index up 1,043.55
points, or 1.5 percent, to 69,648.19. Banks led gains, with
Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, Turkiye Is Bankasi AS and Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi AS each rallying by at least 2 percent in
Istanbul trading.  The Fed’s decision to increase liquidity “is supportive
for risk appetite and riskier assets as it supports cheap and
abundant liquidity conditions,” said  Fatih Keresteci , a
strategist at HSBC Bank AS in Istanbul.  The cost of protecting Turkish debt against non-payment for
five years using credit default swaps fell 6 basis points to
122, the lowest since February 2006, according to data provider
CMA. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a debtor
fail to adhere to its agreements.  U.S. policy makers are running out of options to add fuel
to the country’s economy and the liquidity injections may hurt
emerging markets, Deputy Prime Minister  Ali Babacan  told
reporters in Istanbul today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
