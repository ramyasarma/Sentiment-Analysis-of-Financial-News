Spyglass Entertainment Group Inc. is
entitled to a $4 million breakup fee plus expenses of as much as
$500,000 if it suffers any damage from a breach of its management
agreement with the bankrupt studio, according to a court filing.  The breakup fee won’t be triggered by pre-bankruptcy changes
to MGM’s deal with Spyglass, which were “consensual,” said two
people with knowledge of the deal who declined to be named.  Spyglass executives Gary Barber and  Roger Birnbaum  are
supposed to run Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. after its
bankruptcy. They produced “The Sixth Sense,” a supernatural
thriller, and would be entitled to the fee if they were not
made co-chief executives of a reorganized MGM, one of the
people said.  MGM will ask a bankruptcy judge to approve the fee, the
person said. Kenneth Deutsch and Christopher Brearton, lawyers
for Spyglass, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  The studio, distributor of James Bond and Rocky movies,
originally planned to buy a film library from Spyglass in
exchange for almost 5 percent of its stock in a reorganized
company. Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , an MGM creditor, said
yesterday he agreed to support the studio’s bankruptcy plan
after it abandoned the idea of buying the library.  MGM filed for bankruptcy yesterday in Manhattan with a plan
to wipe out $4 billion in debt after rejecting a takeover bid by  Lions Gate Entertainment Corp . and Icahn.  The case is In re Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. 10-
15774,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
