Coffee futures jumped to 13-year high
on concern that global demand will outpace shrinking supplies.
Cocoa and orange juice fell.  Adverse weather has eroded prospects for production in
Brazil and Colombia, the world’s biggest producers of arabica
beans. Global demand will continue to increase, led by emerging
markets such as Brazil and Russia, said Daisuke Kobayashi, a
trader at the beverage- ingredients section of Tokyo-based
Kanematsu Corp., Japan’s largest importer of specialty coffee.  “The fundamentals are bullish,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior
analyst at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago. “There is also
a lot of option-related buying.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery gained 9.65 cents, or
4.9 percent, to settle at $2.058 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached $2.0925,
the highest level since August 1997.  Coffee may extend the rally to $2.15 by the end of this
month, Kanematsu’s Kobayashi said.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery rose
$70, or 3.6 percent, to $2,002 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.
Earlier, the price reached $2,015, the highest level since Oct.
3, 2008.  Harvesting in Vietnam, the biggest producer of robusta
beans, has been delayed by rains, according to officials and
executives in Dak Lak province, the top growing region.  Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Cocoa futures for March delivery declined $1 to $2,798 a
ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures for December delivery
fell 9 pounds, or 0.5 percent, to 1,818 pounds ($2,960) a ton.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery declined 1.45
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.61 a pound in New York, snapping a
six-session advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
