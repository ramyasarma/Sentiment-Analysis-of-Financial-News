Liberian President  Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf  placed her entire Cabinet on administrative leave and
appointed deputies to stand in their places.  “The reason for demanding their mass administrative leave
is that this administration is entering a critical stretch,”
according to a  statement  published on the website of the
presidency in the capital, Monrovia. “A Cabinet restructuring
will be made in the shortest possible time” and several
ministers may be reappointed, it said.  Last month, the government said it was investigating the
role of former and current public officials in suspected
corruption involving a proposed carbon deal, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported today, without citing anyone.  Johnson-Sirleaf was elected as Africa’s first female
president when  Liberia  held its first postwar elections in
October 2005. The West African nation is rebuilding its economy
following civil wars between 1989 and 2003 in which an estimated
250,000 people died and most of country’s infrastructure was
destroyed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
