General Motors Co. , the biggest
overseas automaker in China, said sales increased 19.6 percent
in the country in October as it sold more Buick, Chevrolet and
Cadillac cars.  GM and its Chinese joint ventures sold 199,641 units last
month, it said in an e-mailed statement today, compared with
about 166,900 in October 2009. The company is on course to sell
two million vehicles this year in the world’s largest auto
market, Detroit-based GM said.  The pace of sales growth accelerated from the 15 percent
reported for September, which was the slowest rate in at least
18 months as the effect of government stimulus measures wore
off. Chinese dealers have stepped up incentives to lure
customers and the government offered subsidies for buyers of
energy-efficient models.  GM, which is preparing for an initial public offering that
may raise as much as $10.6 billion, makes the Buick Excelle and
Chevrolet Cruze in China with its partner  SAIC Motor Co.  GM’s
passenger-car venture with SAIC sold 100,833 units last month,
according to the statement.  The Detroit-based company also makes Sunshine minivans at
SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co., a venture in which the U.S.
automaker has a 34 percent stake. SAIC-GM-Wuling sold 93,935
vehicles in China in October, 5.1 percent more than in the same
period a year earlier, GM said today.  In the first 10 months this year, GM’s China sales jumped
35.5 percent to 1,976,913 units, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
