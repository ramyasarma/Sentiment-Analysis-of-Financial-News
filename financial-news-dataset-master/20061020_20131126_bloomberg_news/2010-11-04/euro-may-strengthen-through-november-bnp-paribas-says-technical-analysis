The euro may keep climbing versus the
dollar for the next three weeks even as it approaches a level
that usually signals a drop is imminent, BNP Paribas SA said,
citing technical indicators.  The nine-day relative strength index for the euro versus
the greenback was at 69.4 today. While readings above 70
indicate an asset’s value may be poised to retreat, any reversal
in the 16-nation shared currency may not be quick, according to
 Andrew Chaveriat , a New York-based technical analyst at the
firm. The last time the euro rose above 70, in September, it
stayed there for 18 days and surged 5.4 percent.  “It suggests more upside here,” Chaveriat said. “We’ve
got another couple of weeks before we get really overbought
again.”  The euro added 0.5 percent to $1.4206, from $1.4139
yesterday. It touched $1.4282, the highest level since January.  Nov. 25 is the one-year anniversary of a peak in the euro
versus the dollar, Chaveriat added. The currency pair reached a
$1.5144 that day, a 14-month high.  The euro has rallied 11 percent since Aug. 27, when Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech the central
bank “will do all that it can” to ensure a continuation of the
U.S. economic recovery. The Fed said yesterday it will buy $600
billion in Treasuries through June to spur inflation and
employment, a move that may debase the dollar.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
