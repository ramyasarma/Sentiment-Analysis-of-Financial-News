Higher coffee prices are a result of
speculation and are unsustainable at current levels, said  Howard Schultz , the chief executive officer of  Starbucks Corp ., the
world’s largest coffee-shop operator.  Schultz made the comment today on an earnings conference
call.  Arabica coffee traded in New York has jumped 51 percent
this year and today reached $2.0925 a pound, the highest price
since August 1997. The December contract gained 9.65 cents, or
4.9 percent, to settle at $2.058 on ICE Futures U.S.  Global demand will continue to increase, led by emerging
markets such as Brazil and Russia, said Daisuke Kobayashi, a
trader at the beverage-ingredients section of Tokyo-based
Kanematsu Corp., Japan’s largest importer of specialty coffee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
