VimpelCom Ltd. , Russia’s second-
biggest mobile network operator, is “optimistic”  Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE  will resolve an ownership dispute with the
Algerian government over its local unit, Alexey Subbotin,
VimpelCom’s director of investor relations, said.  The boards of VimpelCom and Weather Investments SpA,
Orascom’s parent company, will meet before the end of this month
to finalize a merger agreement even if Orascom’s Algeria unit
doesn’t get governmental approval to be included in the deal, he
said. VimpelCom and Weather said Oct. 4 they had agreed to merge
most of their assets in a transaction valued at about $6.5
billion. VimpelCom’s shareholders will meet in late January or
early February to vote on the merger, Subbotin said.  “The transaction is not just about Algeria,” Subbotin
said in a telephone interview from Moscow. “We have a much more
practical approach. Other assets of Weather Investments are
attractive to us.”  Subbotin declined to comment on whether VimpelCom is
involved in negotiations to end Orascom’s Algerian dispute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
