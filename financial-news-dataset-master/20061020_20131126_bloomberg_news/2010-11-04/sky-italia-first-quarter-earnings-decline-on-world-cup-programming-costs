 Sky Italia Srl, the Italian
satellite-broadcasting unit of  News Corp. , said fiscal first-
quarter operating profit fell 36 percent because of programming
costs related to the soccer World Cup.  Operating income fell to $82 million from $128 million a
year earlier, the company said in a  statement  last night. Growth
in revenue “was more than offset” by higher subscriber
acquisition costs and programming expenses to cover the World
Cup tournament in South Africa. Sky Italia’s net client
additions rose the most since the last three months of 2008.  News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch’s  Sky Italia competes with  Mediaset SpA , the broadcaster
controlled by Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi . The two
companies are vying for viewers, lowering prices and adding
high-definition broadcasts.  “Our short-term priority has been top-line growth,
particularly subscribers, and we’ve begun achieving those
objectives through new pricing and packaging, technology
leadership, and re-energized marketing,” News Corp. Chief
Operating Officer  Chase Carey  said in a conference call. “We’re
certainly not declaring victory, but I believe we’re making the
right moves and making headway.”  Sky Italia added about 58,000 net subscriptions in the
third quarter, the most since the December 2008 quarter. The
subscriber base rose to about 4.8 million at the end of
September.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
