Santander U.K. Plc  and Achmea
Hypotheekbank NV increased their planned sales of mortgage-
backed securities to meet demand from investors seeking high-
yielding top-rated bonds.  The British unit of Spain’s largest bank is selling $3.8
billion of AAA rated notes backed by U.K. home loans, up from at
least $2.8 billion initially marketed, according to two people
familiar with the deal. The mortgage division of Achmea Holding
NV increased its offering of Dutch mortgage bonds to 1.2 billion
euros ($1.7 billion) today from 749 million euros offered
earlier this week, the people said.  Investors are buying senior mortgage-backed securities on
speculation that government bond yields will decline after
Federal Reserve said it’s going to purchase an additional $600
billion of Treasuries to stimulate the world’s largest economy.
Yields on five-year Treasuries declined to a record low today
after the second round of so-called quantitative easing.  “QE2 provides more capital into the system and in
particular into money market funds,” said  Gordon Kerr,  the
London-based head of European asset-backed securities strategy
at Citigroup Inc. “These investors need to reinvest this
capital and typically look to do so in highly rated assets, and
European mortgage-backed securities fit that role perfectly.”  Holmes Master  The Santander deal is being conducted through its Holmes
Master Issuer Plc Series 2010-1 vehicle with $500 million of
class A1 securities due Oct. 2011 yielding 15 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate. It will sell another
$900 million of A1 notes due 2014 at 140 basis points over
Libor.  The London-based lender also will sell 750 million euros of
bonds due 2016 at 150 basis points more than Euribor, and 375
million pounds ($609 million) of fixed-rate notes due 2017 at
195 basis points more than U.K. gilts. Santander U.K. also
preplaced 500 million euros of A3 securities.  Achmea sold 353.1 million euros of A1 notes to yield 95
basis points more than the euro interbank offered rate and 846.9
million euros of A2 notes with a spread of 135 basis points. The
deal was done through DMPL VIII BV.  “Holmes and DMPL bonds are more attractive to investors
after the Fed announcement,” said  Attilio Di Mattia,  who helps
oversee 4.5 billion euros of assets at Aurelius Capital
Management in Vienna. “As long as the Fed keeps pumping
liquidity, investors will keep hunting for yield and mortgage
backed securities are one of the best places for that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
