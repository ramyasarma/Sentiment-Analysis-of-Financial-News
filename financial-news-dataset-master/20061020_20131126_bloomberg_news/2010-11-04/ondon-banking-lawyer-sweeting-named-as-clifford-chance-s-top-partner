Malcolm Sweeting , a London lawyer who
advises clients on financing restructurings, mergers and
acquisitions, was elected as the senior partner of  Clifford
Chance LLP , the highest-grossing U.K. law firm.  Sweeting will succeed  Stuart Popham , who is stepping down
from the post in December after eight years. Sweeting has been a
partner at the firm since 1990, Clifford Chance said today in a
statement. He advised on the financing of  Philip Green ’s failed
takeover bid for  Marks & Spencer Group Plc  six years ago and on
refinancing $16 billion of debt for Cemex SAB, the firm said.  Sweeting said in the statement he was “greatly honored”
to be elected.  “This is a very exciting time for the firm as we are
particularly well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities
presented by the growth economies in Asia, Latin America, Africa
and elsewhere,” he said.  Clifford Chance, whose clients include many major U.S. and
U.K. banks, regained its spot as the highest-grossing U.K. firm
this year. The firm’s revenue fell 5 percent to 1.2 billion
pounds ($1.9 billion) for the fiscal year ended on April 30.
Profits per partner rose 25 percent to 933,000 pounds, after
falling 37 percent the prior year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
