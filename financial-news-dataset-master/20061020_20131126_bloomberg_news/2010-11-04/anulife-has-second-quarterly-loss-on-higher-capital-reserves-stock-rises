Manulife Financial Corp.  had its
biggest gain in almost seven months after the insurer reported
third-quarter results that were better than some analysts
expected as equity markets rallied.  The third-quarter net loss widened to C$947 million ($945
million), or 55 cents a share, from C$172 million, or 12 cents a
year earlier, Canada’s largest insurer said today in a
statement.  Manulife recorded C$2.03 billion in costs to reflect
changes to insurance assumptions and a C$1.04 billion writedown
on its U.S. business, according to the statement. That offset
C$1.04 billion in gains from an equity market rebound.  “Short-term, the numbers were not so bad,” said  Stephen Gauthier , a money manager at Fin-XO Securities in Montreal who
helps manage about C$500 million in assets. “The headlines were
a lot better than what was expected.”  Manulife said adjusted  profit  was C$779 million, within its
estimate of C$700 million to C$800 million per quarter.
Excluding “unusual” movements such as the writedowns, the
Toronto-based insurer had profit of 42 cents a share, said
Andre-Philippe Hardy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. That
topped his  estimate  of 35 cents.  Toronto-based Manulife was expected to have a loss before
items of 77 cents a share, the average estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Manulife climbed C$1.21, or 9.4 percent, to C$14.11 at 4
p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
gain since April 9.  Canadian Profit  The U.S. insurance unit recorded profit of C$206 million,
compared with a year-earlier loss of C$601 million, on equity
gains. U.S. asset-management profit fell 43 percent to C$340
million. Manulife owns Boston-based John Hancock Financial.  Profit from the insurer’s Canadian unit more than tripled
to C$358 million as funds under management increased, while its
Asia and Japan unit profit climbed 36 percent to C$567 million.  Manulife is the third of Canada’s four main life insurers
to report results this week. Industrial Alliance Insurance and
Financial Services Inc. said profit climbed 8.8 percent to
C$65.4 million, or 78 cents a share, while Sun Life Financial
Inc. had net income of C$453 million, or 79 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss.  Great-West Lifeco Inc., Canada’s second-biggest insurer, is
scheduled to release results Nov. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
