Comedy Central’s  Jon Stewart  has
overtaken  David Letterman  and  Jay Leno  as the king of late-night
U.S. television, at least for a month, the cable network said.  “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” in October averaged 1.3
million viewers ages 18 to 49, a group advertisers target,
topping NBC’s “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” and CBS’s
“Late Show With David Letterman,” the Viacom Inc.-owned cable
channel said today in an e-mailed statement.  The ratings boost came as Stewart and “Colbert Report”
host  Stephen Colbert  hosted the “Rally to Restore Sanity and/or
Fear” on Oct. 30 in Washington. The duo attracted more than
250,000 to the three-hour event, while 2.4 million watched on
television, Comedy Central said. This is the first late-night
victory since 2000 for a program other than “The Tonight Show”
or “Late Show,” Comedy Central said.  Viacom, also owner of the MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon cable
networks, rose 23 cents to $38.99 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.  Class B shares  of the New York-based
company have gained 31 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
