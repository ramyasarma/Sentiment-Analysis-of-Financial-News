The cost of protecting debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped to the lowest in six months as
investors bet banks will benefit from a divided Congress and the
Federal Reserve plans to buy Treasuries.  Credit-default swaps on the New York-based firm declined
8.6 basis points to 115.4 at 4:30 p.m. in New York, according to
data provider CMA. That’s the lowest since April 15, the day
before the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
for fraud.  Contracts on the debt have declined from as high as 228.5
basis points on May 6. Goldman Sachs settled the SEC’s complaint
for $550 million in July, the largest penalty the agency has
ever levied against a Wall Street firm. The Republican gains in
the Nov. 2 congressional elections combined with Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke ’s $600 billion bond-buying program are boosting
the banking sector, Societe Generale’s  Michael Reiner  said.  “Goldman has solid earnings power and also stands to
benefit, along with the rest of the sector, from a less
stringent regulatory environment,” said Reiner, a New York-
based credit strategist with the bank.  Contracts on Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. fell 12 basis points to 169.5 and those on
JPMorgan Chase & Co. fell 6.3 basis points to 85.7, CMA data
show. The cost to protect Citigroup Inc.’s debt decreased 6
basis points to 135.5, and on that of San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo & Co. eased 9 basis points to 101.4, according to CMA.
Swaps on Morgan Stanley declined 11 basis points to 151.9, CMA
data show.  Tame Earnings  “These large banks are not operating using the same
leverage,”  Adrian Miller , fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mailed
message. “Hence the earnings growth will be tame relative to
the pre-crash days.”  Goldman Sachs climbed $3.76, or 2.3 percent, to $166.39, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That’s 10 percent off
the highest level in 2010 prior to the suit.  Swaps on Goldman Sachs debt, which typically rise as
investor confidence deteriorates, soared 34 basis points and
shares dropped 12.8 percent on April 16. The SEC accused the
firm of defrauding investors in a CDO linked to home loans by
concealing that Paulson & Co., a New York-based hedge fund,
picked components of the CDO and bet it would collapse.  Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 86.1 basis points,
also the lowest since April 15, according to index administrator
Markit Group Ltd.  Retailers Beat Estimates  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 4.2 basis points to 94.9, and
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps on 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 23.6
basis points to 433.3, Markit prices show.  Credit-default swaps on Limited Brands Inc. declined 19.3
basis points to 163.1, the lowest since May, CMA data show,
after the clothing retailer reported third-quarter profit that
beat the average analyst estimate. Contracts on Saks Inc.
dropped 54.2 basis points to 511.9, the biggest decline in
almost six months, the data show, following the luxury
retailer’s report that October same-store sales increased 8.1
percent, beating the 3.6 percent estimate.  Credit-default swaps on  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. 
climbed the most in seven weeks after Canada blocked  BHP
Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile bid for the world’s largest
fertilizer producer. The swaps jumped 11.3 basis points to 107.7
basis points, CMA data show.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
