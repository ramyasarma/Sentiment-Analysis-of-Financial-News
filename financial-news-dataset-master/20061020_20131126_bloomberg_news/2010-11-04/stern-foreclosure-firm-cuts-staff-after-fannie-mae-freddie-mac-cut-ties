David Stern , the Florida foreclosure
lawyer who is under investigation by the state’s attorney
general, made “a substantial layoff” after Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac cut ties with his firm.  The layoffs occurred today,  Jeffrey Tew , Stern’s lawyer,
said in an interview. Stern’s law firm and the foreclosure-
processing business he runs, DJSP Enterprises Inc., have cut
about half their staff during the past two weeks, Tew said.  “It’s the cumulative effects of clients not referring
business,” Tew said. He said he couldn’t comment on whether
there would be further staff reductions.  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the mortgage-finance companies
operating under U.S. conservatorship, said this week they ended
ties with Stern. Florida Attorney General  Bill McCollum  said he
is investigating Stern’s law firm because it appears to be
submitting “false and misleading” documents in foreclosure
cases.  Stern’s businesses continue to operate and have a total of
between 400 to 500 employees, Tew said. DJSP, whose chief
executive officer is Stern, said in an Oct. 22 statement that it
was cutting 198 employees, bringing total layoffs at the time to
about 300.  To contact the reporter on this story:
