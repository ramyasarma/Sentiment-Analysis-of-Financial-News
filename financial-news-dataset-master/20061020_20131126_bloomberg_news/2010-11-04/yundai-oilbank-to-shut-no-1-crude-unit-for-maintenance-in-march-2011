Hyundai Oilbank Co., South Korea’s
fourth-biggest oil refiner, plans to shut a crude processing
unit at its Daesan refinery for maintenance next year, an
official said.  The refiner will close the 110,000 barrel-a-day No. 1 crude
distillation unit for about a month in March, said the official,
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
talk to the media about the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
