BRE Bank SA , the Commerzbank AG unit
that’s Poland’s third-biggest bank by assets, said third-quarter
net income rose to the highest level in two years as it cut bad-
loan provisions.  Net income almost tripled to 206.5 million zloty ($74.5
million) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 72.5 million
zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said in a statement
today. The result exceeded the 197.1 million-zloty  mean estimate 
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Provisions declined by half to 128.2 million zloty amid an
improvement of the “economic situation” among BRE corporate
clients, it said.  “Accelerating positive trends in provisions may result in
earnings upgrades as the current 2010 Bloomberg consensus of 517
million zloty net profit is well within reach,”  Maciej Baranski , an analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA, said in a note to
investors.  BRE net interest income, the difference between what the
bank pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, rose 17
percent to 481 million zloty in the three months ended Sept. 30
after it lowered interest on client deposits. At the same time
fees increased 22 percent, BRE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
