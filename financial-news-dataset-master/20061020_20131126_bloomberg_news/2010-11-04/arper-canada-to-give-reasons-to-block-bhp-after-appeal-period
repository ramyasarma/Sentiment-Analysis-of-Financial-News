Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said the government will explain why BHP Billiton Ltd.’s
bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. was rejected once the
30-day appeal period ends.  Harper also said that members of his Conservative Party
widely support the decision, and so do many Canadians who
normally support business investment. He made the comments in
response to questions in Parliament today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
