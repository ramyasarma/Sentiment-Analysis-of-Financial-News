Daily reported, citing a study by the China Geological Survey.  The poor quality of the water is affecting people’s health
and causing conflicts over supply, the report cited Zhang
Zhaoji, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences,
as saying at a conference on Nov. 3.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
