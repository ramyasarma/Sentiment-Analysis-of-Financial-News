A landslide in the suburbs outside of
Costa Rica’s capital killed at least 15 people and another 20
are missing, said Noemi Coto, spokeswoman for the Costa Rican
Red Cross.  The landslide came after two days of heavy rains and
dragged away a dozen homes, Coto said. Flooding in Escazu, west
of San Jose, forced 500 to evacuate their homes and take refuge
in shelters, Coto said in a telephone interview from San Jose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
