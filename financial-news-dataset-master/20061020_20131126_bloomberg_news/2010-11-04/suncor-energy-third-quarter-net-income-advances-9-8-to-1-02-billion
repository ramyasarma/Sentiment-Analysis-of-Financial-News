Suncor Energy Inc. , Canada’s largest
oil company, rose the most in almost 20 months after a 19
percent increase in production boosted third-quarter profit
above analysts’ estimates.  Net income rose 9.8 percent to C$1.02 billion ($1.01
billion), or 65 cents a share, from C$929 million, or 69 cents,
in the year-earlier quarter, Calgary-based Suncor said in a
statement today. Per-share operating earnings exceeded the
average estimate of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey by 3
cents.  Suncor lifted oil and natural-gas production to the
equivalent of 635,500 barrels of crude a day as the company
benefited from its 2009 acquisition of Petro-Canada and new
wells in eastern Canada and Syria came online.  West Texas
Intermediate crude , the benchmark that governs prices Suncor
receives for most of its oil output, rose 12 percent to average
$76.09 during the third quarter.  “This was one of our strongest quarters for oil sand
production in Suncor’s history,” Chief Executive Officer  Rick George  said in the statement.  Suncor  rose  C$2.58 to C$35.48 at 4:11 p.m. on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. The shares gained as much as 9 percent, the most
since March 2009.  Oil and gas output exceeded UBS AG’s third-quarter estimate
by 2.7 percent, said  George Toriola , a Calgary-based analyst for
the Swiss asset manager and investment bank.  Tar-Sands Gain  Production from Suncor’s oil-sands operations in western
Canada, excluding its Syncrude Canada Ltd. joint venture,
climbed to 306,600 barrels a day from 305,300 barrels last year,
the statement said. Syncrude, the world’s biggest oil-sands
miner, is a joint venture whose owners include Suncor, Exxon
Mobil Corp., Canadian Oil Sands Trust, ConocoPhillips and Murphy
Oil Corp.  Suncor cut its total production forecast for this year to
the equivalent of 590,000 barrels a day from 610,000 barrels as
a result of asset sales.  The company completed its C$25.9 billion acquisition of
Petro-Canada in August 2009, and the comparative figures for the
third quarter reflect two months of the combined company.  Higher energy prices were partly offset by the widening of
light-heavy crude differentials and the strength of the Canadian
dollar versus the U.S. dollar, the company said.  Suncor said it has sold around C$3.5 billion of non-core
assets to date, from Trinidad and Tobago to the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
