Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said the government still has sufficient votes in Congress to
ratify a treaty that would reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear
weapons after this week’s congressional elections.  Both countries are committed to the  New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty , Clinton said in a speech today in Wellington,
New Zealand’s capital. She said she would like to see the treaty
passed when Congress returns for a short session before new
members are seated early next year.  “We are working hard to pass the treaty,” Clinton said.
“We believe we have enough votes to pass it in the Senate, it’s
just a question of when it is brought to a vote.”  Republican victories in the Nov. 2 U.S. elections prompted
a Russian parliamentary committee yesterday to withdraw its
backing for the treaty while it assesses whether America can
approve it. Republicans, who generally oppose the START Treaty,
narrowed the Democrats majority by gaining at least six seats.
They needed 10 seats to gain a majority.  The new START treaty is intended to reduce the Russian and
U.S. nuclear arsenals and increase transparency about what each
nation’s stockpiles hold.  “Both the U.S. and Russia are committed to passing” the
treaty, Clinton said. “We take this treaty very seriously and I
know the Russian government does as well.”  President  Barack Obama  and Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  signed the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New
START, in April. The original START accord expired in December
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
