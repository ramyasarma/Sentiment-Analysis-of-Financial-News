Industrias Penoles SAB , Mexico’s
largest silver producer, climbed to the highest level in 31
months after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would buy $600
billion of Treasuries to spur the economy.  Penoles gained for the seventh time in the last eight days,
climbing 4.7 percent to 388.22 pesos at 1:58 p.m. New York time.
Earlier, the shares climbed as much as 7.1 percent to 396.98
pesos, the highest intraday level since April 2008.  The Fed’s plan to inject more cash into the economy led
silver to a 30-year high and  emerging-market  stocks to the
highest level since June 2008.  The U.S. Dollar Index fell for a third straight day.  “A weaker dollar makes the price of metals rise in
general,” said  Rodrigo Heredia , an analyst at Ixe Grupo
Financiero in Mexico City. “You’re going to take refuge in
assets that will conserve their value.”  Heredia said a better U.S. economic outlook will lead
investors to favor riskier emerging-market assets over metals,
which will eventually hurt miners such as Penoles.  “In the first months of the coming year, we’ll probably
see a correction based on a preference for capital markets over
more secure assets.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 6.1 percent to
$25.92 an ounce on the Comex.  The  IPC index  climbed 1.2 percent to 36,255.31 and was
poised to close at a record high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
