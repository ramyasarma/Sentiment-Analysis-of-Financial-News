Clarium Capital Management LLC, the
hedge-fund firm run by PayPal co-founder  Peter Thiel , lost 17.1
percent this year for clients, according to an investor briefed
on the returns.  The firm’s $347 million Clarium LP fund declined 1 percent
last month, said the investor, asking not to be named because
the information is private.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for the
San Francisco-based firm, said he couldn’t comment.  Hedge  funds  climbed an average 1.1 percent last month and
3.1 percent this year, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.’s
 HFRX Index .  Clarium, founded by Thiel, 43, in 2002 after selling
online-payments service PayPal to EBay Inc. for $1.5 billion,
trades everything from stocks to commodities, seeking to profit
from broad economic trends, a strategy known as macro investing.
Such funds gained 1 percent last month and have declined 2
percent this year, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund
Research.  Thiel manages $742 million in assets, down from about $7
billion at its 2008 peak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
