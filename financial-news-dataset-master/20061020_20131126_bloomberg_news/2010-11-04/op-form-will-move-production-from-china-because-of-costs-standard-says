Top Form International Ltd . plans to
shift production out of China because of increases in labor
costs and the value of the yuan, the Standard said, citing
Chairman Willie Fung.  The bra-maker will open factories in the Philippines and
Thailand, where the average cost of production is about 15
percent lower than in China, the Hong Kong-based English-
language newspaper reported  today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
