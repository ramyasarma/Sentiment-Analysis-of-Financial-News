MetLife Inc. , the insurer with more
than 200 home-loan offices in the U.S., said it doesn’t expect a
“material” cost tied to disputes over its procedures for
taking property from borrowers through foreclosures.  “MetLife Bank verifies the accuracy of borrower
information included in affidavits filed in foreclosure
proceedings,” the New York-based insurer said today in a
regulatory filing. “We do not believe that MetLife Bank has
material exposure to potential losses arising from challenges to
its foreclosure procedures.”  MetLife found irregularities in foreclosure processes and
is delaying the sale of some seized properties, Moody’s
Investors Service said on Oct. 14. The insurer, which acquired a
mortgage unit from First Horizon National Corp. in 2008,
followed  Bank of America Corp.  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  in
announcing reviews of operating practices as regulators
investigate the banking industry for improper foreclosures.  The insurer said losses linked to foreclosure errors and
repurchase obligations are limited to $49 billion of loans
originated by MetLife Bank. Its servicing portfolio is worth
about $83 billion, according to the filing.  President  Barack Obama  has endorsed a coordinated
investigation by attorneys general from all 50 states into
whether lenders used false documents to justify seizing homes.
Delays and litigation may cost banks $10 billion,  Paul Miller ,
an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia, said
on Oct. 14.  MetLife’s Bank  MetLife has owned a bank for about 10 years, Chief
Financial Officer  William Wheeler  said in December. The company
announced two acquisitions in 2008, including the purchase of
the mortgage origination and servicing business of First
Horizon’s First Tennessee National Bank Association. With the
deals, MetLife Bank’s employee count surged to 3,764 at the end
of June from 82 three years earlier, according to  data  from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  MetLife Bank had $14.4 billion of assets, including $3.82
billion of residential real estate loans at the end of June,
according to the FDIC. The company had a mortgage loan-servicing
portfolio of $64.1 billion at the end of December, according
MetLife’s annual report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
