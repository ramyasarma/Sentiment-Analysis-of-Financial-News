Travelers Cos. , the insurer added to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year, rallied to its
highest closing price since the firm merged with St. Paul Cos.
in 2004.  The insurer climbed $1.33, or 2.4 percent, to $57.24 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Its 15
percent gain in 2010 gives it the best performance among the
four financial companies in the Dow this year. Before today,
Travelers’s highest close since the merger was $56.76 in 2007.  Travelers, the only financial firm in the 30-company Dow
that didn’t take bailout funds, remained profitable through the
credit crisis by investing in municipal bonds and corporate
debt.  Citigroup Inc. , which spun off Travelers Property Casualty
Corp. in 2002, and insurer  American International Group Inc. 
were pulled from the index as record losses on real estate-
related investments depressed their stock values by more than 90
percent. Travelers took the new name after its merger.  “The company has had generally good and improving
profitability over the past several years,” said  Mark Dwelle ,
an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. They were “positioned to
take advantage of some of the troubles that AIG faced.”  Travelers has posted the seventh-biggest increase in the
Dow this year. Lenders  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Bank of America
Corp.  have declined while credit-card company  American Express
Co.  has advanced about 8 percent since Dec. 31.  JPMorgan has fallen about 39 percent since its high of
$65.67 in March 2000 and Bank of America has plunged about 78
percent after peaking at $54.90 in November 2006.  ‘Pretty Good Run’  Travelers said Oct. 21 that full-year operating profit will
be $5.75 to $5.95 a share, compared with the previous  forecast 
of $5.20 to $5.45. The insurer said that third-quarter net
income climbed about 7.5 percent to $1.01 billion.  “We’ve had a pretty good run here for some time,” Chief
Executive Officer  Jay Fishman  said in a conference call that
day.  Fishman led Travelers under Citigroup, and left the post in
2001 to run St. Paul. He engineered the merger with Travelers in
2004, creating the second-largest U.S. provider of property
casualty insurance to businesses, behind AIG.  Travelers said today that it will take a 43.4 percent stake
in J. Malucelli Participacoes em Seguros e Resseguros SA, a
Brazilian company, for $371 million. Fishman is seeking to
expand the surety-insurance business by entering Latin America’s
biggest economy. The deal should be “modestly accretive” to
Travelers’s profit next year, Fishman said.  The top gainer in the Dow this year has been  Caterpillar
Inc. , the world’s largest maker of construction and mining
equipment, which surged 46 percent. Bank of America has declined
19 percent since Dec. 31, the Dow’s biggest drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
