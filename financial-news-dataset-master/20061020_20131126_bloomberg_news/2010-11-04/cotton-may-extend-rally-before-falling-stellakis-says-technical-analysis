Cotton futures, already trading at a
record, may jump another 17 percent after prices topped their
historical trading range, according to a technical analysis by
independent analyst  Jim Stellakis .  Weekly price charts show cotton has traded mostly between
30 cents and 97 cents a pound in New York since 1972, Stellakis
said. The fiber began to exceed that 67-cent trading range in
September on a “mix of fundamentals,” signaling another rally
by that same amount, he said. Futures will rise to $1.64 a pound
in the next month or so from today’s record of $1.4052, he said.  “If a market stays between two levels for a long period of
time, initially you would expect it to move by that range total
when it broke up or down,” said Stellakis, whose analysis of
coffee futures in July correctly predicted that commodity would
reach a 13-year high.  Cotton prices have more than doubled in the past 12 months,
reaching the highest level since the fiber began trading in New
York 140 years ago, mostly because of a widening production
deficit in China, the world’s largest user.  Cotton for December delivery rose today to a record $1.4052
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after gaining the exchange
maximum of 5 cents, or 3.7 percent.  Once prices reach the top of their new 67-cent trading
range, they are likely to tumble, Stellakis said by telephone
from New York.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
