Investors should buy the koruna
against the euro before a Czech central bank meeting today as
policy makers may “tolerate” more currency gains to quell
inflation, BNP Paribas SA said today.  The Ceska Narodni Banka will probably raise its economic-
growth outlook for this year and next, increasing pressure to
boost interest rates sooner than previously forecast. The bank
will leave its benchmark  two-week repurchase rate  at a record-
low 0.75 percent at its meeting in Prague, according to 13 of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We would go short euro-koruna into the CNB meeting,” BNP
emerging market strategists led by  Shahin Vallee  in London wrote
in a note to clients today. “The council appears comfortable
with using the koruna as a deflationary tool, thus keeping
ultra-low interest rates.”  The koruna advanced less than 0.1 percent to 24.495 per
euro as of 9:54 a.m. in Prague.  A short position is a bet that a price of an asset, in this
case the euro against the koruna, will decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
