Japanese  stocks  rose, driving up the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average by the most in seven weeks, as the
dollar strengthened after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it will
expand record measures to support the world’s largest economy.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, and  Canon
Inc. , the No. 1 camera maker worldwide, both gained more than 2
percent. Fast Retailing Co., Asia’s biggest clothing chain,
surged 8.1 percent after its Uniqlo chain posted its smallest
domestic sales decline in three months. Tokyo Electron Ltd., the
world’s second-biggest maker of semiconductor equipment, climbed
3.1 percent after boosting its profit and dividend forecasts.  Since the Fed’s measures “were close to what people had
expected, a sense of ease spread,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Since the scale of easing was
moderate, there are still hopes for further easing.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 2.2 percent to 9,358.78 at the 3 p.m.
market close in Tokyo, the biggest gain since Sept. 15 and the
most among benchmark Asia-Pacific indexes. The broader  Topix 
climbed 1.6 percent to 816.33 after seven consecutive decreases.
All but one of the 33 industry groups in the Topix rose, and
more than seven times as many shares advanced as declined.  The Nikkei 225 has slumped 11 percent this year, the most
among the world’s 40 largest equity markets. Today’s advance
boosted the average price of stocks in the gauge to 16.6 times
estimated earnings, the highest level in a month.  Fed, Elections  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent
today. The index gained 0.4 percent to a six-month high of
1,197.96 yesterday in New York as banks rose after the Fed said
it will buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through
June. In elections on Nov. 2, Republicans seized control of the
U.S. House and narrowed the Senate’s Democratic majority in
elections shaped by voter anxiety over jobs and the economy.  The Bank of Japan said last week that policy makers
advanced their next session to today and tomorrow, following the
Fed’s meeting of Nov. 2-3.  Toyota gained 2.3 percent to 2,910 yen and Canon climbed
2.9 percent to 3,780 yen. They were the  biggest supports  for the
Topix. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker,
advanced 1.5 percent to 2,766 yen and was today’s most-active
stock by value in Japan.  The dollar appreciated to 81.58 yen today, the strongest
level this month, boosting the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  ‘Uncertainties Removed’  The yen appreciated to 80.22 on Nov. 1, the highest level
since 1995. The yen is on course for its strongest annual
average level since currencies began trading freely in 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s
closing price.  “The trend of a depreciating dollar will pause for a
while” now that “uncertainties about the Fed and the midterm
elections have been removed,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps
oversee about $17 billion as chief strategist in Tokyo at Toyota
Asset Management Co. “The dollar had weakened on expectations
for additional easing, and sentiment had worsened too much.”  Fast Retailing surged 8.1 percent to 11,700 yen, its
biggest gain since October 2009 and today’s  steepest increase  in
the Nikkei. The company said domestic sales at its  Uniqlo chain 
dropped 1.1 percent, the smallest drop in three months.  Tokyo Electron advanced 3.1 percent to 4,670 yen. The
company raised its net income forecast 4.8 percent to 66 billion
yen ($813 million) and increased the planned midterm dividend to
38 yen a share from 34 yen after second-quarter profit beat
analyst estimates.  Exceeding Estimates  Minebea Co., a maker of ball bearings, soared 5.6 percent
to 453 yen, the  third-biggest gain in the Nikkei . The company
forecast net income for the year ending in March will more than
double to 13.5 billion yen from a year ago, 8 percent more than
Minebea’s earlier projection.  More than five Japanese companies have  exceeded profit
estimates  for every four that have fallen short, based on
Bloomberg data compiled from about 680 companies in the Topix
that have reported quarterly results since Oct. 7. About 360
companies of the index’s more than 1,650  are scheduled  to
announce earnings this week, according to Bloomberg data.  Mitsubishi Corp. , Japan’s largest commodities trader,
advanced 3.1 percent to 2,025 yen. JX Holdings Inc., the
country’s biggest oil refiner and copper producer, rallied 3.4
percent to 483 yen. Inpex Corp., the nation’s No. 1 oil explorer,
gained 2.6 percent to 430,500 yen.  Crude oil for December delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent
to $85.29 a barrel in electronic trading in New York today,
after climbing yesterday to its highest settlement since May 3.
Copper futures gained as much as 1.4 percent in London.  To contact the reporter for this story:
