Asian currencies rose, led by
Taiwan’s dollar and South Korea’s won, on speculation additional
U.S. monetary stimulus will weaken the dollar and bolster demand
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$30.59 against the
greenback as of 4 p.m. local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
South Korea’s won added 0.2 percent to 1,107.81 and the Thai
baht advanced 0.1 percent to 29.71. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia
Dollar Index , which tracks the region’s 10 most-traded
currencies excluding the yen, traded at 115.99 and reached
116.01, its highest level since April 2008.  “The Fed program reinforces market expectations for
further weakness in the dollar,” said  Akira Banno , a treasury
adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“This should continue to favor Asian currencies, especially
where central banks have been raising rates.”  The Federal Open Market Committee yesterday said it will
buy an extra $600 billion of Treasuries through June to spur
growth in the world’s biggest economy and kept its pledge to
keep interest rates low for an “extended period.” Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted at least $500 billion of the so-
called quantitative easing.  The U.S. and Japan have cut benchmark interest rates to
near-zero and printed money to support their economies, while
central banks in India, China, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and
Thailand have all raised borrowing costs this year to contain
inflation.  Capital Controls  Investors have poured a net $47 billion into stocks in
India, South Korea and Taiwan this year to benefit from some of
the world’s fastest growth rates. Asia’s developing economies
will expand 9.4 percent in 2010, compared with 2.7 percent in
advanced countries, the International Monetary Fund forecast in
October.  Asian nations may undertake joint measures to prevent
excessive speculation in their currencies, Thai Finance Minister
Korn Chatikavanij told reporters today in Bangkok. “The central
bank told me that they are in close talks with other regional
central banks,” he said. “If necessary, they may jointly issue
measures to prevent excessive speculation.”  The won approached a two-year high as the  Kospi  stock index
climbed to levels last seen in 2007. Overseas investors bought
more shares than they sold for a  third day . South Korea plans to
“actively consider” capital controls as the nation expects
more inflows into emerging markets, Kim Ik Joo, a director
general at the finance ministry, said by telephone today.  “The FOMC statement will eventually soothe uncertainty in
the market, extending the dollar’s weakness against the won,”
said Ha Joon Woo, a currency dealer at Daegu Bank in Seoul.  Malaysia Bond Holdings  Malaysia’s ringgit was little changed at 3.0820, compared
with 3.0835 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It earlier reached a 13-year high of 3.0780. Bank Negara
Malaysia has raised its overnight rate three times this year to
2.75 percent from 2 percent, and will hold its final policy
meeting for 2010 on Nov. 12.  Overseas funds owned a record 68 billion ringgit ($22
billion) of Malaysia’s government bonds at the end of September,
66 percent more than at the start of the year, according to
central bank figures. Markets are closed in Malaysia tomorrow
for a public holiday.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso gained 0.1 percent to 42.505,
the Indonesian rupiah added 0.2 percent to 8,898 and the
Singapore dollar rose 0.2 percent to S$1.2836. The Chinese yuan
appreciated 0.05 percent to 6.6726.  To contact the reporters on this story:
