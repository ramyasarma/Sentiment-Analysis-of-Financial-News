S-Oil Corp. , South Korea’s third-
biggest oil refiner, plans to shut a crude processing unit at
its Onsan refinery for maintenance next year, an official said.  The refiner will close the 232,000 barrel-a-day No. 2 crude
distillation unit for about a month from May, said the official,
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
talk to the media about the plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
