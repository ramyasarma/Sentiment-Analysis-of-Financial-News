Coffee may extend a rally to $2.15 a
pound by the end of this month as supply from Colombia, the
second-largest producer of arabica beans, may be smaller than
forecast, said Japanese trading company Kanematsu Corp.  “We had expected Colombian production to recover to 10.5
million bags next year. But output may be less than 10
million,” said Daisuke Kobayashi, trader at the beverage
ingredients section of Tokyo-based Kanematsu, Japan’s largest
importer of specialty coffee. Colombian growers cut this year’s
crop forecast by 5 percent to 9.5 million bags on Oct. 14.  Coffee has rallied 44 percent this year as above-average
rainfall hampered a recovery from Colombia’s smallest harvest in
33 years last year, while drought in Brazil, the world’s biggest
producer, may reduce its output to a four-year low next year.
Global demand will continue to grow, led by emerging markets
such as Brazil and Russia, Kobayashi said.  “Coffee consumption in Brazil, which expanded by 6 to 7
percent annually, may surpass the U.S. to become the world’s
largest as early as 2012,” he said in an interview in Tokyo.  Arabica coffee for December delivery lost 1.6 percent to
$1.9615 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York Nov. 3. The
price reached $2.046 on Oct. 26, the highest level since August
1997. Coffee shipments from producers will decline in 2010 from
last year’s estimated 95.5 million bags and 2008’s 97.7 million,
according to the International Coffee Organization. Each bag
weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  Easing Expectations  To be sure, coffee could drop as much as 16 percent in
coming weeks after an “exaggerated” rally this year,  Christian Praun , a trader at Terra Futuros, Brazil’s fourth-biggest coffee
brokerage, said Oct. 27.  “Coffee may not have much room to advance as its rally was
driven by not only fundamental factors but credit-easing
expectations,” said Masayo Kondo, the president of Commodity
Intelligence Ltd., a Tokyo-based research company.  The Federal Reserve announced yesterday it will buy an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June, expanding
record stimulus and risking its credibility in a bid to reduce
unemployment and avert deflation.  Still, Colombian coffee output slumped 32 percent to 7.8
million bags last year, the smallest volume since 1976. A
damaging fungus and above-average rainfall that affects plants’
ability to flower may hamper next year’s crop, Agriculture
Minister  Juan Restrepo  said on Oct. 15.  Reduced supply from Colombia spurred roasters in Japan, the
world’s third-largest importer, to seek alternatives from
countries including China and Laos, Kobayashi said.  Colombia was the second-largest coffee supplier to Japan
last year, shipping 76,911 metric tons of green beans,  data  from
the Ministry of Finance show. Japan’s purchases from China and
Laos were 6,336 tons and 1,260 tons respectively.  Robusta Shift  A surge in arabica coffee prices also prompted some
roasters to shift to robusta beans to curb an increase in the
raw-material costs, which may help narrow a price gap between
the two products, Kobayasi said. Arabica coffee is grown mainly
in Latin America and brewed by specialty companies including
 Starbucks Corp.  Robusta coffee, used in espresso and instant
drinks, is harvested mostly in Asia and parts of Africa.  Robusta coffee futures lost 0.4 percent to $1,932 a ton in
London on NYSE Liffe on Nov. 3. The price reached $2,010 on Nov.
1, the highest level since October 2008.  A rally in coffee boosted costs for processors including
Key Coffee Inc, the largest Japanese roaster after  UCC Holdings .  “If the market climbs further, we may have to consider
raising product prices,” UCC said in a statement on Nov. 2.  Yuji Niikawa , senior managing director at Key Coffee, told
reporters on Oct. 25 the company may decide whether to raise
prices after watching the market’s movement “for a while.”  Imports May Drop  Higher prices may lead to a drop in Japan’s coffee imports
next year as many of Japanese roasters have difficulty in
passing increased raw-material costs onto customers amid
deflation, Kobayashi said.  Japan’s deflation deepened in September as  core consumer
prices  declined 1.1 percent on year after a 1 percent drop in
August. If roasters raise product prices, consumers may reduce
purchases as coffee is not a necessity, Kobayashi said.  To cope with higher raw-material costs, companies such as
canned coffee makers may cut the volume of beans in each product
rather than raising their prices, he said.  Japan imported 390,938 tons of green coffee beans last year,
rising from 387,538 tons in 2008, according to the  Ministry of
Finance . The country also imported 6,020 tons of roasted coffee
beans last year, down from 6,652 tons in 2008.  Japanese imports, including soluble and liquid coffee,
peaked at 458,507 tons in 2006 and then retreated to 425,778
tons in 2007 because of rising international prices, according
to  All Japan Coffee Association , a roasters’ organization.  Of the total imports, about 30 percent is used for
production of canned coffee and the similar volume is used to
produce instant coffee, according to the group.  To contact the reporters for this story:
