The European Union risks handing a
competitive advantage to the U.S. and China if it fails to
change a patent system which companies, such as  Air Liquide SA ,
say costs too much.  “There’s an urgency to find a solution to de-block this
point on competitiveness for our companies,”  Michel Barnier ,
the EU’s internal-market commissioner, said at a conference in
Brussels yesterday. “We won’t be credible if prices for our
patents in Europe are above those of U.S. patents.”  Barnier’s remarks come a week before ministers from the 27
EU nations gather to discuss a new proposal for a region-wide
patent system. The EU patent, an idea that’s been discussed for
some 40 years, was thought dead in 2004 after member nations
failed to agree on the language system to go with it.  Now, four years after the European Commission revived the
plans, the EU-wide system is closer than ever, according to the
head of Europe’s patent agency, which acts independently from
the EU.  “We’ve never been this close to an agreement,”  Benoit Battistelli , president of the European Patent Office, said in an
interview in Brussels. The Munich-based EPO is the only place
for companies to apply for a multi-national patent, which has to
be defended in each country once it’s been granted.  “This fragmented litigation market in Europe for patents
is costing us a lot,”  Thierry Sueur , vice-president of
intellectual property at Air Liquide, the world’s biggest maker
of industrial glass, said at the event in Brussels.  Belgium, holder of the EU’s rotating presidency until the
end of the year, foresees a language framework similar to that
of the EPO. Patents would be granted in French and German as
well as English. Spain has opposed plans to exclude Spanish.  “Any political solution should protect linguistic
diversity,” Alberto Casado Cervino, director general of the
Spanish Patent Office, said at the Brussels event.  Air Liquide’s Sueur said continued clashes over languages
will hurt European companies like his. “We have no time for
fancy theories, we’re fighting hard to win over our competitors
from the other side of the ocean or from China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
