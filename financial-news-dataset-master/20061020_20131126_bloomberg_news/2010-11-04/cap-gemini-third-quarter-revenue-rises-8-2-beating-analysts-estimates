Cap Gemini SA , Europe’s largest
computer-services company, said third-quarter sales rose 8.2
percent, beating analysts’ estimates, driven by demand from the
financial industry.  Revenue climbed to 2.11 billion euros ($2.98 billion) from
1.95 billion euros a year earlier, the company said in an e-
mailed statement. Analysts had predicted sales of 2.03 billion
euros, according to the average of six estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Computer-services companies are betting that the global
economic recovery will drive companies to make information
technology investments they deferred during the recession.
Providers including Infosys Technologies Ltd. and Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. have signaled rising demand from
corporate clients.  “As predicted, we have regained growth in the third
quarter and some of our industries -- such as Financial Services
-- have reported excellent results,” Chief Executive Officer
 Paul Hermelin  said in the statement.  Bookings in the third quarter rose 15 percent to 2.18
billion euros. The Paris-based company confirmed its target for
revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent on a like-for-like
basis in the second half and a full-year operating margin of
more than 6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
