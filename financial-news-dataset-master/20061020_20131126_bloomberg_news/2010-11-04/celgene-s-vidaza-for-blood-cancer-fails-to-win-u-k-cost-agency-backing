Celgene Corp. ’s Vidaza failed to win
the backing of the U.K. National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence as a treatment for people with certain blood
conditions who aren’t eligible for stem-cell transplants.  The high cost outweighed the benefits of the drug for
people with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myeloid
leukemia and intermediate and high-risk myelodysplastic
syndromes, the agency, known as NICE, said in preliminary draft
guidelines published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
