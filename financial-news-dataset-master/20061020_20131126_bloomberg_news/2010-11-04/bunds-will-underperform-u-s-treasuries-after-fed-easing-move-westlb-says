German government bonds will probably
underperform Treasuries because the European Central Bank is
unlikely to follow the Federal Reserve’s decision yesterday to
increase asset purchases, WestLB AG said.  “The contrast in stance between the two major central
banks should ensure that bunds continue to underperform
Treasuries, and is also likely to feed into further euro-dollar
upside in coming days,” analysts including  John Davies  in
London wrote in a research report today.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year Treasuries
instead of equivalent-maturity German bunds narrowed three basis
points to 12 basis points at 7:36 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
