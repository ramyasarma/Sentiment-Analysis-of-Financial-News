United Nations emission offsets for
2010 dropped for the sixth day, pulling down their relative-
strength index to the lowest level in 21 months on speculation
that Europe will ban credits from some industrial-gas projects.  UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for December 2010
fell as much as 2 percent to 12 euros ($17.09) a metric ton
today on London’s European Climate Exchange. That was the
weakest intraday price since Aug. 2.  The contract’s 14-day relative strength index, a technical
chart used by investors to predict trends, fell today to 24.39,
the lowest level since Feb. 16, 2009. It has stayed for five
days below 30, a reading that signals prices may be poised for a
rebound, according to some analysts and traders who study
technical charts.  UN credits can be used for compliance in the European
Union’s cap-and-trade program, the world’s largest emissions
market. The European Commission, the EU regulator, plans to
present a proposal this month that may include a ban on credits
related to projects that cut nitrous oxide and
hydrofluorocarbons as soon as the beginning of 2013.  EU carbon allowances for December fell 1.2 percent to 14.52
euros a ton as 10:50 a.m., extending their decline to 5 percent
over the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
