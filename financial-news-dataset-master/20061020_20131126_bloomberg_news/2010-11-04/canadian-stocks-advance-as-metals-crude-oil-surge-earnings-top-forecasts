Canadian stocks  rose the most in two
months as oil and metals surged on a weaker U.S. dollar and
companies including Suncor Energy Inc. and Manulife Financial
Corp. reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Suncor, Canada’s largest oil and gas producer, advanced 7.9
percent after surpassing the average analyst profit forecast by
8.3 percent. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold
producer, gained 2.2 percent as the metal jumped 3.2 percent.
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer by market value, fell 3.5 percent after the
Canadian government blocked BHP Billiton Ltd.’s takeover bid.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  increased 224.44
points, or 1.8 percent, to 12,895.56 as of 3 p.m. in Toronto
after touching a two-year intraday high of 12,919.80.  “We had better results from Manulife, which has been a
drag on the market for quite some time,” said  Stephen Gauthier ,
who helps manage C$500 million ($499 million) as a money manager
at Fin-XO Securities in Montreal. “We also had good results
from Suncor, apart from the fact there was a delayed reaction to
the Fed announcement yesterday. All of these things are helping
at the same time.”  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Price Index has
soared  20 percent  over the last four months through yesterday as
the U.S. dollar has slumped on concerns that U.S. Federal
Reserve stimulus policy would increase the money supply,
weakening the currency. Yesterday, the Fed said it will buy an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June.  Two-Year High  The CRB index extended a two-year high today as the U.S.
dollar fell against all other major currencies.  Crude oil climbed for a fourth day, rallying 1.9 percent to
$86.29 a barrel. The  S&P/TSX Energy Index  rose the most in five
months to a two-year high.  Suncor gained 7.9 percent, the most in more than a year, to
C$35.49 after reporting production that topped the estimate of
 George Toriola , an analyst at UBS AG, by 2.6 percent. Canadian
Oil Sands Trust, the largest owner of the Syncrude project,
increased 5.2 percent to C$27.49.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the country’s second-
largest energy producer by market value, beat the average third-
quarter profit  forecast  of analysts by 12 percent, excluding
certain items. The shares advanced 4 percent to C$39.25.  Among S&P/TSX companies that have  reported financial
results  since Oct. 7, 58 have beaten the average analyst
estimate while 32 have fallen short.  Precious Metals  Gold futures soared as much as 3.5 percent, the most
intraday since March 2009, and an  index  of S&P/TSX gold
companies rose to a record. Silver surged as much as 6.8
percent.  Barrick climbed 2.2 percent to C$49.74. Kinross Gold Corp.,
Canada’s third-largest gold producer, rallied 4.3 percent to
C$18.70 after surpassing the average analyst estimate for third-
quarter earnings by  13 percent , excluding certain items. Yamana
Gold Inc., the No. 4 producer in Canada, jumped 5.9 percent to
C$11.50 after its adjusted earnings beat estimates by 13
percent.  Silver reseller Silver Wheaton Corp. surged 8.1 percent to
C$32.22. Silvercorp Metals Inc., which mines in China, soared  17
percent , the most since February 2009, to C$11.75. Gabriel
Resources Ltd., which is developing silver and gold projects in
Romania, rallied 11 percent to C$6.90. All three prices are
records.  Manulife Jumps  Manulife, North America’s third-largest insurer, rose 7.8
percent to C$13.91. The company reported a third-quarter loss of
55 cents a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of
78 cents a share, excluding certain items.  Earlier today, the owner of John Hancock Financial Services
Inc. gained as much as 10 percent, the most intraday since April
2009.  Potash Corp. dropped 3.5 percent to C$141.10 after Canadian
Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said a BHP takeover would not
provide a “net benefit” to the country. BHP had bid $40
billion for the company. Government approval of a takeover would
be necessary because BHP is a foreign company.  Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, Agrium Inc.,
declined for a fourth day, decreasing 3 percent to C$83.04.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., the country’s
biggest publicly traded pharmaceutical company, lost 2.9 percent
to C$27.53 after reporting third-quarter revenue that missed the
average analyst forecast by 5.3 percent.  In a press release, Valeant Chief Executive Officer  J. Michael Pearson  called the financial results of the former
Biovail Corp. part of the company “disappointing.” Biovail and
Valeant merged in September.  Copper producer Taseko Mines Ltd. slumped for a third day,
retreating 5.1 percent to C$4.69. Yesterday, the shares plunged
25 percent after the Canadian government rejected plans for a
new mine in British Columbia on environmental grounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
