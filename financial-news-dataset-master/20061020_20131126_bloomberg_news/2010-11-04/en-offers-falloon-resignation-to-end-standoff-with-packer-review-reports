Ten Network Holdings Ltd.’s board has
offered the resignation of executive chairman Nick Falloon to
end a stand-off with the company’s largest shareholder,
billionaire James Packer, the Australian Financial Review said.  Ten has also repeated its offer of two board seats for
Packer and Lachlan Murdoch, which is less than the three seats
that Packer is demanding, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
