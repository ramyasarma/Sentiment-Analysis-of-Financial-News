If hemlines tell which way the stock
market is headed, maybe city skylines do the same for the
economy, in reverse. Tall stories often have unhappy endings.  British Land Co., the U.K.’s second-largest real-estate
investment trust, has revived plans for a 47-story tower in the  City of London  dubbed the “Cheesegrater.”  Land Securities
Group Plc , its bigger rival, has found backers for its “Walkie-
Talkie” building, which will be 10 floors shorter. Next to  London  Bridge, cranes are slapping glass panels onto the soaring
frame of the  “Shard of Glass,”  architect  Renzo Piano ’s 1,000-
foot (305-meter) pyramid that will dwarf the other buildings
north of the  River Thames  to become Britain’s tallest edifice.  The history of London landmarks suggests vertical ambitions
typically presage a southerly direction for the economy. From
the Post Office Tower in the 1960s to the NatWest Tower in the
1980s and the  Canary Wharf  Tower in the 1990s, each was the
tallest London building of its day, and all were harbingers of
tougher times.  In mid-2004, the U.K. was enjoying its 48th consecutive
quarter of gross-domestic-product growth. In the middle of
London, Swiss Reinsurance Co. was moving into a 40-story edifice
called the “Erotic Gherkin” for its resemblance to a swollen
pickled cucumber. Four years later, the British economy
contracted 0.3 percent as it started to sink into a recession,
and continued to shrink for the following five quarters.  Canary Wharf  Canary Wharf Tower stuck its head in the clouds in 1990 to
become the U.K.’s tallest structure at 800 feet and 50 floors.
The economy grew in every quarter in the second half of the
1980s except one, averaging an expansion rate of 0.9 percent.
U.K. house prices increased 1.2 percent a month on average,
according to an index compiled by HBOS Plc, Britain’s biggest
mortgage lender. They rose 3 percent or more for much of 1988
and peaked with a gain of 4.3 percent in July of that year.  Once Canary Wharf was completed, the economy shrank in five
of the next eight quarters. Average quarterly growth from 1990
to 1995 was 0.4 percent, half the performance achieved in the
previous half-decade. The housing market stumbled, posting an
average monthly decline of 1 percent for five years that drove
many householders into “negative equity,” owing more on their
mortgage than their homes were worth. Unemployment soared from
6.9 percent in early 1990 to 10.4 percent by December 1992.  NatWest Tower  Before Canary Wharf, London’s tallest building was the
NatWest Tower, at 600 feet. National Westminster Bank Plc, now
part of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , opened the first City
skyscraper in the early 1980s. In the five preceding years, the
U.K. had avoided a recession, measured as two consecutive
quarters of contraction, and had posted an average growth rate
of 0.5 percent for the period.  The NatWest Tower’s opening coincided with a slump. The
economy contracted for five consecutive quarters from the
beginning of 1980. Its average growth rate in the first five
years of the 1980s was just 0.4 percent. Unemployment, which
averaged 5.25 percent in the second half of the 1970s, shot up
to 8 percent by the end of 1980, reached 10 percent the
following year and peaked at 11.9 percent in 1984.  The building is now named Tower 42. If you look west from
the top floor’s aptly named  Vertigo  bar, you can see the Post
Office Tower, the previous record holder.  Post Office Tower  At 580 feet, excluding a 40-feet aerial, the Post Office
Tower started beaming radio and television signals in 1964.
Three years later, the government was forced to devalue the
pound to $2.40 from $2.80. The economy’s average quarterly
growth rate from 1960 to 1965 was 0.8 percent; it dropped to 0.5
percent in the two years following the Post Office Tower’s
opening, and was 0.7 percent in the five years through 1970.  Now, some economists are concerned government spending cuts
will push the U.K. back into a recession. Last week, Land
Securities opened the City’s biggest mall, with 220,000 square
feet of retail space fighting for customers -- just eight days
after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  detailed more
than 80 billion pounds ($128 billion) of spending cuts and
490,000 public-sector job losses.  London isn’t alone. The Great Depression was the backdrop
to both  New York ’s Chrysler Building -- completed in 1930 after
real-estate developer William Reynolds ran out of funds and sold
the uncompleted building to industrialist Walter Chrysler -- and
the Empire State building, completed in 1931.  In Dubai, the $1.5 billion Burj Khalifa building now holds
the title of the world’s tallest; its name was changed from Burj
Dubai when it opened in January in honor of Abu Dhabi leader
Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. This was a month after Dubai
needed a $10 billion lifeline to avoid default.  Real-estate developers might want to consider the lessons
of history before letting their lofty ambitions get the better
of their reduced circumstances.    Mark Gilbert , author of “Complicit: How Greed and
