Investors should bet the difference
in yield between five-year and 10-year U.S. Treasuries narrows,
because purchases by the Federal Reserve may offset upcoming
sales of the longer-dated securities, BNP Paribas SA said.  “There will be less supply than purchases in the seven-
to-10-year area,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-income
strategist in Paris. “This should be favorable in that part of
the curve and this is why we recommend five-to-10-year
flatteners.”  The  difference  in yield between the two securities widened,
or steepened, three basis points to 149 basis points as of 11:15
a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
