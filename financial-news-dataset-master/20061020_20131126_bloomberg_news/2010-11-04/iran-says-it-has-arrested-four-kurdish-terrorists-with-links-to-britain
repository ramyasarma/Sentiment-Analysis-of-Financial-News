Iran arrested four members of a
Kurdish group on terrorism charges and said they have
connections with the U.K.,  Press TV  reported, citing the 
Intelligence Ministry.  The four men, detained in the western city of Marivan, are
members of the Kurdish  Komala  movement, classified by Iran as a
terrorist organization, and have carried out five assassinations
in the past two years, the state-run news channel said on its
website. It didn’t say who they are accused of killing.  The detainees admitted receiving orders from Jalil Fattahi
in the Iraqi city of Suleymaniyeh, and taking delivery of
weapons and cash, Press TV said. Fattahi, one of Komala’s
commanders, is now residing in the U.K., it said.  Iran accuses the U.K. and the U.S. of seeking to foment
dissent among the Islamic republic’s ethnic minorities, such as
the Kurds. Iranian officials say Britain, which helped topple
Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister  Mohammed Mossadegh 
in a 1953 coup, has a history of intervening in the country’s
politics.  Iran’s northwestern border areas are the scene of frequent
clashes between Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and Kurdish
fighters. Iran’s government is concerned that its Kurdish
population may seek autonomy similar to that enjoyed by its
neighbors in northern Iraq.  The detainees said they were promised $20,000 for each
murder and only received $8,000, Press TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
