Cielo SA , Brazil’s biggest card-
payment processor by market value, said profit rose 23 percent
in the third quarter, boosted by the expanding usage of cards in
the country.  Net income rose to 488.1 million reais ($292.1 million), or
36 centavos per share, from 396.7 million reais, or 29 centavos
a year earlier, the Barueri-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The profit was little changed from 488.5
million reais announced in preliminary results on Oct. 28. The
mean estimate was 459.6 million reais in a  Bloomberg survey  of
11 analysts.  Credit- and debit-card transactions totaled 44.7 billion
reais in September,  up  23 percent from the same month in 2009,
according to the Brazilian Association of Credit Card and
Service Companies, known as  Abecs . Cielo’s financial volume of
transactions rose 24 percent in the quarter to 67.3 billion
reais. Adjusted operating sales, which exclude some items, rose
23 percent to 1.14 billion reais.  The company gave up its right to be the exclusive handler
of Visa-branded transactions in July, complying with government
requirements to boost competition in the credit card market.  Cielo  gained 0.3 percent to 14.48 reais in Sao Paulo
trading. The shares have fallen 5.6 percent this year, while the
benchmark Bovespa index has risen 6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
