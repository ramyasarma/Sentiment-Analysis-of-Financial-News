The pound may climb to its strongest
level this year against the dollar should it end the week above
$1.6320, according to CMC Markets.  The currency was helped by this week’s “robust” report on
services activity and the Bank of England’s decision not to
expand quantitative easing,  Ashraf Laidi , chief market
strategist at CMC Markets in London, wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “A weekly close above $1.6310-20 would suggest prolonged
gains toward $1.6460,” he wrote.  Sterling was the second-biggest gainer against the dollar
among the 16 most-actively traded currencies today, rising 1.2
percent to $1.6274. It hasn’t traded above $1.6460 since
December, when it reached $1.6722.  The Bank of England kept its bond-purchase program
unchanged at 200 billion pounds ($325 billion) today and held
its benchmark interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
