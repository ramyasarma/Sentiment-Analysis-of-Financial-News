Old Mutual Plc is considering
“appropriate” options on what to do with its controlling stake
in Nedbank Group Ltd. after talks to sell the South African
lender to HSBC Holdings Plc failed, Chief Executive Officer
Julian Roberts said.  A transaction would benefit Old Mutual and be
“particularly good for Nedbank and South Africa,” Roberts said
on a conference call with reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
