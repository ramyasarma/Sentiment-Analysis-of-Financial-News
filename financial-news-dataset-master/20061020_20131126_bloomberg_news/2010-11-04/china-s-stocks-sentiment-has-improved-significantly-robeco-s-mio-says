Investor sentiment towards China’s
stocks has “improved significantly” and valuations are
“reasonable,” according to Robeco Group, which oversees about
$186 billion.  Chinese stocks are also attractive on a relative basis as
they have lagged other emerging markets, Victoria Mio, a Hong
Kong-based senior fund manager at Robeco Group, said in an e-
mail. Chinese households are likely to shift more of their
savings into the equity markets as inflation outstrips the
interest paid on bank deposits, according to the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
