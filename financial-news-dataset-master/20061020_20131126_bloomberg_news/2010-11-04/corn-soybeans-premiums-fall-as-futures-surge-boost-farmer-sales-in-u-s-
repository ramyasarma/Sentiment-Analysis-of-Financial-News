Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped to export terminals near New Orleans this month narrowed
on increased sales by farmers and grain elevators after futures
rose to the highest level in more than two years.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in
November fell to 49 cents to 57 cents a bushel above December
futures, from 56 cents to 57 cents yesterday, government  data 
show.  Soybean  premiums fell to 40 cents to 56 cents above
January futures from 45 cents to 56 cents.  “There is too much supply hitting the market,” said
 Ronnie Edge , the marketing manager at Owensboro Grain Co. in
Owensboro, Kentucky. “Farmers sold a little bit more,” and
some commercial firms offered supplies to reduce excess
inventories, he said.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $5.90 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price reached $5.9575, the highest level for a most-
active contract since Aug. 29, 2008.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 37.25 cents, or 3
percent, to $12.7475 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed reached
$12.79, the highest price since Sept. 3, 2008.  Barge  shipments  of grain and soybeans fell to 712,726
metric tons in the week ended Oct. 30, down 7.6 percent from a
week earlier, the USDA said today. An estimated 709 grain barges
were unloaded in New Orleans last week, up 9 percent.  Corn has jumped 58 percent since the end of June as adverse
weather reduced U.S. production.  The corn harvest will be 12.521 billion bushels, less than
the 12.664 billion forecast by the USDA last month, the Linn
Group said today. The soybean crop will be 3.483 billion
bushels, more than the agency forecast of 3.408 billion, the
research and brokerage firm said. The government will update its
forecasts on Nov. 9.  “Buyers are cautious ahead of the USDA report,” Edge
said. “No one wants to own excess inventory.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
