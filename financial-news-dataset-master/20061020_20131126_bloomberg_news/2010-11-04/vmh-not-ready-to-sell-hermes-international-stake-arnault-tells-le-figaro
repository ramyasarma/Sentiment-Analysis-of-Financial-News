(Corrects spelling of Hermes family member’s name in
second paragraph.)  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA 
isn’t ready to sell its 17.1 percent in Hermes International
SCA, Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault  said in an
interview with Le Figaro newspaper.  “I don’t see how the head of a publicly traded company is
qualified to ask an investor to sell his shares,” Arnault said,
according to the French daily. Hermes family member Bertrand
Puech yesterday called on Arnault to sell his stake.  “We’ve taken a stake in Hermes for the long term,”
Arnault said. “This operation is a completely amicable one,
what’s hostile is the demand that we sell our shares.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
