Tanzania ’s Intelligence and Security
Service rejected allegations by an opposition leader that
results from the Oct. 31 election were rigged.  Chadema, the party led by presidential candidate Wilbrod
Slaa, said yesterday that results announced by the National
Electoral Commission were different from those released at
polling stations. Slaa said security agents had tampered with
both the results and the number of votes cast, Agence France-
Presse reported yesterday.  “The department is not involved in whatsoever has been
stated by the Chadema presidential aspirant, nor will it be used
by anyone for personal gain,” Jacky Zoka, deputy director-
general of the service, told reporters today in Dar es Salaam,
the commercial capital.  President  Jakaya Kikwete  won the most votes in 159 of 183
constituencies counted so far, the electoral commission said
today.  Ibrahim Lipumba  of the Civic United Front has the largest
share of votes in 21 constituencies, while Slaa has the most
votes in the three other constituencies, the commission said in
an e-mailed statement. Tanzania has 239 constituencies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
