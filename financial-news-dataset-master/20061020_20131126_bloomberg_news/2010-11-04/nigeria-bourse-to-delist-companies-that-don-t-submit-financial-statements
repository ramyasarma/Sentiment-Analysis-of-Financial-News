The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  will at
the end of this month delist all companies that haven’t
submitted their financial statements, Interim Administrator
 Emmanuel Ikazoboh  said.  “We suspended trading in the shares of 48 companies
because they did not submit their financial statements and any
company that failed to do this by the end of this month will be
delisted from the exchange,” Ikazoboh said in an interview in
Lagos yesterday.  The decision is part of measures the exchange is taking to
restore credibility to the market. Abuses such as share-price
fixing on the Nigerian exchange, sub-Saharan Africa’s second-
biggest, fueled a 64 percent slump in stock prices from the
start of 2008 to the end of last year. The West African nation’s
central bank used $4.1 billion to bail out lenders and fired
chief executive officers of eight institutions after they
amassed bad debts estimated at $10 billion, posing a threat to
their survival.  The Security and Exchange Commission appointed Ikazoboh as
interim administrator of the exchange on Aug. 5, after removing
Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke as the bourse’s CEO in a move the regulator
said was to reinforce the “integrity” of the market.  “We want to ensure that only fundamentally sound companies
would be listed on our exchange. And we want to ensure that
global standards are kept in running our exchange,” he said.  The bourse suspended 15 companies, including  Golden Guinea
Breweries Plc , on Sept. 8 for failing to submit their 2008
financial statements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
