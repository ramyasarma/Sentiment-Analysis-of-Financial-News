Gold Fields Ltd. , Africa’s second-
largest producer of the metal, said first-quarter production of
the precious metal climbed to the highest in two-and-a-half
years, beating its own guidance.  Total output for the three months through September rose to
908,000 ounces from 898,000 ounces the previous quarter, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. That
compares with guidance of 906,000 ounces given on Sept. 23.  “This is the highest quarterly production since the third
quarter of 2008,” Chief Executive Officer  Nick Holland  said.  South African gold producers, seeking to maintain or expand
their output, face rising costs as they dig deeper to exploit
shrinking reserves. The nation has the world’s deepest mines and
workers extract the metal out of rock as far as 2.35 miles (3.8
kilometers) underground.  The results are “looking good” and “have come in line
with what we expected,” said  Leon Esterhuizen , an analyst with
Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd., by phone from London. “Cost
improvements were good.”  Shares  in the company rose 3.05 rand, or 2.8 percent, to
111 rand as of the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, valuing the
company at 78.4 billion rand ($11.5 billion).  Higher Australian Output  Net income fell to 701 million rand during the quarter from
900 million rand in the previous three months, Gold Fields said.
South African analysts compare consecutive quarters rather than
against the same period a year earlier. Total costs fell 0.8
percent to 164,898 rand per kilogram, Gold Fields said.  Production from the company’s South African operations rose
1.8 percent to 497,000 ounces, while output from its Tarkwa and
Damang mines in Ghana fell 6.4 percent to 172,000 ounces, Gold
Fields said. The company’s South American business produced
86,000 ounces, 10 percent more than the previous quarter, while
output from Australia advanced 2.7 percent to 153,000 ounces.  The company plans to cut the number of contractors working
at its operations in South Africa to lower costs,  Tim Rowland ,
the unit’s acting vice president, said in an interview in
Johannesburg. “We want to curtail contractors where we can and
internalize the work,” he said. The company has 50,000
employees, 10 percent of which are contractors, he said.  Gold Fields expects to report attributable gold production
of between 3.5 million ounces and 3.8 million ounces for the 12
months through June 2011. Costs per ounce of production are
expected to be between $650 and $690, it said.  “Gold Fields remains on track to achieve the production
and cost guidance,” Holland said in today’s statement.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.  is Africa’s biggest gold producer
while  Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.  is third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
