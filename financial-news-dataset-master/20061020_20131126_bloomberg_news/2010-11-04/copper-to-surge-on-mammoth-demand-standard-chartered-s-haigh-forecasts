Copper will extend a bull run as
“mammoth demand” from China, the largest user, and supply
constraints combine to drive the market into a deficit from next
year until 2014, according to  Standard Chartered Plc .  “We are seeing a serious reduction in the supply of copper
at a time when demand is quite robust,”  Michael Haigh , the
bank’s global head of commodities research, said today in Seoul.
“Copper will continue to perform incredibly well.”  Copper, used in pipes, advanced to within 5 percent of a
record last month on increased demand, declining stockpiles and
a  weaker dollar . Factory output in China grew at the fastest
pace in six months in October. Deutsche Bank AG said Nov. 2 that
the metal’s outlook presented a “perfect storm” for bulls.  The “copper market, we believe, will be in deficit until
2013, maybe 2014,” Haigh said at a seminar. “Copper has really
been an outlier in terms of its performance, but it is
fundamentally driven.”  Three-month futures peaked at $8,940 a metric ton in July
2008, two months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. helped to pitch the global economy into recession. The
metal, which touched $8,554 on Oct. 26, traded today at $8,499
at 3:46 p.m. in Singapore.  Record Price  Jeremy Gray , Standard Chartered’s global head of equity
research for resources, forecast in an August report that copper
may rise to $12,000 a ton in the next two years. None of the
 seven largest producers  will bring on any new production next
year or in 2012, the report said.  The three-month contract in London may average $7,850 a ton
in the fourth quarter compared with $7,282 in the third,
according to slides from Haigh. The price may average $8,325 a
ton in 2011 compared with $7,369 in 2010, the slides showed.  “Things are not looking very rosy on the supply side given
Chile and Peru’s reduction in output,” said Haigh, who joined
Standard Chartered in July. “We are seeing mammoth demand for
copper from China and these two suppliers cannot keep pace.”  The copper market may turn to a deficit of 723,000 tons in
2011 from a surplus of 112,000 tons this year, with the gap
widening to 1.2 million tons in 2012 and further to 1.5 million
tons in 2013, according to Haigh’s presentation. The Lisbon-
based  International Copper Study Group  last month forecast a
2011 deficit of 435,000 tons.  LME copper  stockpiles  stood at 366,075 tons yesterday, the
lowest level since October last year, according to exchange
figures. They have shrunk 27 percent this year.  The economy in China, the top consumer of raw materials
from copper to soybeans, grew 9.6 percent in the third quarter.
Refined-copper consumption in China may expand 11.5 percent to
6.8 million tons this year,  Yang Changhua , a senior analyst at
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co., said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
