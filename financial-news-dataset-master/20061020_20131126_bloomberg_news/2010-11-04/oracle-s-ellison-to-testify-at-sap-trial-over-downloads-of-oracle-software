Oracle Chief Executive Officer  Larry Ellison , who has said the new head of rival Hewlett-Packard Co.
oversaw “industrial espionage” while he was at SAP AG, will
testify Nov. 8 at a trial between Oracle and SAP, a lawyer said
in court.  Geoffrey Howard , an Oracle attorney, told U.S. District
Judge  Phyllis Hamilton  in Oakland, California, that is his best
estimate for when he will call Ellison as a witness. Hamilton
asked about high-profile witnesses to make arrangements for
potential media interest.  Ellison said in an Oct. 26 statement that Oracle plans to
produce evidence that Hewlett-Packard Co. CEO  Leo Apotheker  was
involved in an effort to steal Oracle software while at SAP.  HP says Apotheker had a limited role in the SAP software
maintenance unit where the downloads took place, and claims
Ellison is seeking to harass him.  Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, the second-
largest maker of software for business applications behind SAP,
sued its competitor in 2007. It seeks at least $2.3 billion in
damages for what a former SAP unit acknowledges were fraudulent
downloads of Oracle software that infringed Oracle copyrights.  The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
