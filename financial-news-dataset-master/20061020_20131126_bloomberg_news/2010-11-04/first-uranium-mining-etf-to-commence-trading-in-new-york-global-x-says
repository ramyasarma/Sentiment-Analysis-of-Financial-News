The world’s first exchange-traded
fund linked to uranium-mining companies will begin trading in
New York tomorrow, according to  Global X Management Co. , the
issuer of the security.  The ETF will track an index that consists of 23 miners and
refiners including  Cameco Corp. , the world’s second-largest
uranium producer,  Uranium One Inc.  and  Paladin Energy Ltd. , said
Bruno del Ama, the chief executive officer of Global X. The
shares will initially sell for $15 each, and the ticker for the
fund listed on the NYSE Arca stock exchange will be URA, he
said.  “There are a lot of nuclear reactors being built around
the world, and there’s already a short supply of uranium,” del
Ama said. “With new demand coming into play, that’s going to
increase prices of uranium, and obviously the mining companies
that produce uranium are going to benefit tremendously from
that.”  Global X, a New York-based asset manager, also has an ETF
tracking gold-exploration companies that will begin trading
today. The ticker of the fund, which tracks 30 explorers, is
GLDX, del Ama said by telephone yesterday.  “There’s going to be a huge amount of interest,” he said.
“We’ve seen a lot of inquiries from hedge funds, institutional
investors and retail investors.”  Global X also provides ETFs linked to silver and copper
miners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
