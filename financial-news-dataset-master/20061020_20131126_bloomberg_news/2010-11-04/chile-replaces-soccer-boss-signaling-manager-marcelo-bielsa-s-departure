Chile’s soccer association elected a
new president in an outcome that may lead to the resignation of
 Marcelo Bielsa  as national coach.  The presidents of Chile’s professional soccer clubs chose
Jorge Segovia, owner of local team Union Espanola, to replace
Harold Mayne-Nicholls as association president by 28 votes to
22, according to state television channel TVN.  Bielsa, a former Argentine national coach who this year led
Chile to its first World Cup qualification since 1998, said in
televised remarks yesterday that he would resign if Mayne-
Nichols wasn’t reelected.  “I can’t work with Segovia,” Bielsa told reporters
yesterday. “It’s simply impossible.”  Mayne-Nichols hired Bielsa as Chile’s national coach team
in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
