Grupa Lotos SA, Poland’s second-
largest oil refiner, said third-quarter net income rose to 1.05
billion zloty from 578.8 million zloty a year earlier as the
strengthening zloty cut the cost of its foreign-currency
denominated loans.  That compares with the 729.3 million-zloty mean estimate of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest and taxes increased to 242.6    
million zloty from 184.3 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
