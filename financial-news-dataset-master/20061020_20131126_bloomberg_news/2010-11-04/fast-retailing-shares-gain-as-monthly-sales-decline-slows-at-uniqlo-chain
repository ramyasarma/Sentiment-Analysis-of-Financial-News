Fast Retailing Co. , Japan’s biggest
clothing chain operator, rose the most in 13 months in Tokyo
trading after a sales decline slowed at its Uniqlo chain.  Fast Retailing  jumped 8.1 percent to 11,700 yen, the
biggest advance since Oct. 5, 2009, at the 3 p.m. close on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sales at Uniqlo stores open at least a
year in Japan dropped 1.1 percent in October, the smallest
decline in three months, the company  said  Nov. 2. Japan’s
markets were closed for a public holiday yesterday.  The retailer benefited from cold weather toward the end of
October, which increased demand for winter apparel, it said. It
snowed on Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido last month and
 Fast Retailing  offered discounts on the Heattech thermal-wear
line on Oct. 23 and Oct. 24.  Uniqlo’s same-store sales in Japan may fall 4.7 percent
this fiscal year, as it expects a 9.8 percent drop in the six
months ending Feb. 28, the company said last month. Comparable
sales, which strip out the effect of stores open less than a
year, plunged 25 percent in September, the biggest decline in
more than seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
