European  developed-market stocks will
trail returns in emerging-market equities for a third straight
year in 2011 as company  earnings  grow by half as much, according
to ING Investment Management which has $536 billion in assets.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index will still rise 16 percent to
310, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by 8.5 percent to 1,300 and
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index will surge 18 percent to 1,350
by the end of next year, said ING strategist  Patrick Moonen .  The emerging-markets benchmark beat the European gauge by
more than 45 percentage points in 2009 and is on course to
exceed the European equity benchmark by 10 percentage points
this year amid signs that the economic recovery in Europe and
the U.S. is stalling.  “Markets are discounting zero percent earnings growth in
2011 and this would only be believable if there was going to be
a double dip recession, which we don’t believe,” ING’s Hague-
based Moonen said yesterday. “From a valuation point of view
equity markets are still attractive.”  Companies in developing nations will grow earnings by  twice 
as much as those listed on developed European exchanges next
year, Moonen forecasts. Smaller debt burdens will help
developing countries grow 6.5 percent next year compared with
1.6 percent growth in gross domestic product of developed
countries, according to ING Investment Management estimates.  More stock buybacks and more takeovers by companies as
central banks maintain interest rates at record-low levels will
also spur an equities rally in 2011, Moonen forecasts. Record-
low interest rates and more central bank stimulus will also buoy
the rally in stocks, he said.  Stock-index forecasts were calculated from yesterday’s
closing prices.  For related news and stories:  To contact the reporter on this story:
