Elpida Memory Inc.  fell in Tokyo
trading after a report that the Japanese chipmaker plans to cut
production for the first time in two years and put off plans to
build a plant.  Elpida fell as much as 6.3 percent on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, while the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 1.7
percent.  The company is set to cut production of computer memory
chips and postpone the construction of a second plant in Taiwan
in response to plunging prices, the Nikkei reported, without
saying how it got the information. Elpida spokesman  Hiroshi Tsuboi  declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
