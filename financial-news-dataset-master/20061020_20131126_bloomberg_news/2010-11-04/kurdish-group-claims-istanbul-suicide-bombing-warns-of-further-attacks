A group linked to the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party, or PKK, claimed responsibility for a suicide
bombing in Istanbul’s central Taksim Square that injured more
than 30 people, and warned that attacks will continue.  The group, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, or TAK, said on
its  website  that the Oct. 31 bombing was carried out by one of
its commanders on his own initiative.  Turkish authorities say TAK acts under instructions from
the PKK, while the PKK and TAK deny the link. TAK frequently
claims responsibility for attacks in major cities and tourism
centers that kill or injure civilians, which the PKK has
recently vowed to avoid.  In an interview with Radikal newspaper last week, Iraq-
based PKK senior commander  Murat Karayilan  apologized for
civilian deaths and vowed not to harm civilians in future
attacks.  The PKK, whose fight for autonomy against the Turkish state
has led to some 40,000 deaths since 1984, most of them
civilians, has declared a unilateral cease-fire until next
year’s general elections in Turkey.  The Freedom Falcons said in today’s message that they were
not bound by the PKK cease-fire and warned that their attacks
will continue.  The group said the bomber, Vedat Acar, had joined the
Falcons in 2005 and received training among a group of “suicide
commandos.” It said his attack was not aimed at civilians.  The bomb attack, near a police bus in Istanbul’s main
square and entertainment district, injured 15 police and 17
others, authorities say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
