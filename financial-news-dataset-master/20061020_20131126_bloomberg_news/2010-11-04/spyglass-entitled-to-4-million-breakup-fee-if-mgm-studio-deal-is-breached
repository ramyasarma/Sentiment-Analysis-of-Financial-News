Spyglass Entertainment Group Inc.,
whose executives Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum will run Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. after its bankruptcy, is entitled to a $4
million break-up fee plus expenses of as much as $500,000 if it
suffers any loss or damage from a breach of its agreement with
the studio, according to a court filing.  The break-up fee won’t be triggered by last-minute changes
to MGM’s deal with Spyglass, which were “consensual,” said two
people with knowledge of the arrangement, who declined to be
named.  To contact the reporter on this story:
