Global economic recovery will not be
in jeopardy if the price of oil rallies to $90 a barrel, and
crude prices are unlikely to rise as high as $100 next year,
according to OPEC.  The  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ,
responsible for 40 percent of worldwide crude supplies, is
comfortable with oil prices at between $70 and $85 a barrel, the
group’s secretary-general said today. Saudi Arabia’s Oil
Minister  Ali Al-Naimi  said in Singapore on Nov. 1 that a range
of between $70 and $90 a barrel is satisfactory for consumers.
The kingdom had previously indicated a preferred target of $75
a barrel.  “I don’t think we’ll see $100 oil in 2011,” Secretary-
General  Abdullah El-Badri  said at a press conference in Vienna
held to launch OPEC’s annual long-term outlook.  Crude for December delivery climbed to a six-month high of
$86.68 a barrel today on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
the Federal Reserve said yesterday that it would expand record
measures to spur growth in the U.S., the world’s largest crude
consumer.  Financial speculators are not as “aggressive” in driving
oil prices this year as they were in 2008 and 2009, El-Badri
said. Speculators are typically considered to be buyers and
sellers of futures contracts without a need for physical barrels
of oil, such as hedge funds.  OPEC forecast in its World Oil Outlook that global oil
demand will increase 5.1 percent to 89.9 million barrels a day
in 2014 from this year, and grow to 105.5 million a day in 2030.  To contact the reporter on this story:
