European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet signaled that budget plans to be announced later
today by the Irish government may calm some investors’ concerns
about the country’s fiscal health.  “I have no reason to think that observors will be
disappointed,” Trichet said at a press conference in Frankfurt.
“The front loading of the program is of extreme importance.”  The government will publish new economic forecasts for the
period through 2014 at 4:30 p.m. in Dublin today, the Finance
Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The government last
month said it needs 15 billion euros ($21 billion) of savings
over the next four years. Trichet said that such savings “are
not, in our view, insufficient.”  Ireland will have a “very substantial” borrowing
requirement next year even with 6 billion euros in budget
savings in 2011, a government spokesman said today.  Irish 10-year securities fell for an eighth day, the 
longest streak in two years, pushing the yield premium over 
bunds to a record. The Irish 10-year bond tumbled, sending 
the yield 24 basis points higher to 7.81 percent. The 
difference in yield, or spread, between Irish bonds and 
benchmark German bunds rose as much as 23 basis points to 
525 basis points, according to Bloomberg generic data. That’s 
the most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1991.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
