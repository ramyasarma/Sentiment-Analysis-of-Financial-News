Canadian five-year government bonds
are the most attractive in seven years when compared with U.S.
securities as the Bank of Canada avoided following the Federal
Reserve in buying debt to bolster economic growth.  The  difference  in yields widened to 0.95 percentage point,
the most since November 2003, according to Bloomberg data.
Canadian five-year debt yielded 2.03 percent yesterday, compared
with 1.08 percent for U.S. Treasury  notes .  Canada’s economic recovery has been steadier than its
southern neighbor’s, allowing Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  to raise benchmark interest rates three times since June
to 1 percent, before pausing last month. Canadian five-year
yields fell to 18-month lows after Carney paused, though they
declined by less than U.S. yields, which are near record lows
after the Fed announced yesterday it would buy $600 billion of
bonds by the end of June to spur growth.  “The five-year sector is unquestionably rich compared to
the rest of the Canadian curve, and yet cheap compared to the
U.S.,”  Eric Lascelles , chief economics and rates strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit in Toronto, wrote in
an e-mail. “The two countries are experiencing divergent
economic and central bank performances.”  Demand was good for Canada’s C$3.5 billion ($3.5 billion)
of five-year bonds auctioned yesterday, according to  Mark Chandler  at RBC Capital, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada, the
nation’s biggest lender. The 2 percent bonds drew an average
yield of 2.18 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.43 times,
compared to 2.26 percent and 2.25 times at the previous five-
year auction in August.  Auction Tail  The difference between the high yield and the average
yield, known as the tail, at 0.6 basis point was “reasonable,
given how well the sector has done over the past couple of
months,” Chandler, head of Canadian fixed-income and currency
strategy in Toronto, said via e-mail. A smaller tail usually
indicates demand. The tails at the previous two auctions were
0.18 basis points and 0.73 basis points, according to  Bank of
Canada  data.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold the debt of Canada’s corporations instead of its
federal government remained at 142 basis points, or 1.42
percentage points, from 142 basis points at the end of October,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. It was at 145
basis points on Sept. 30. The so-called spread in U.S. corporate
bonds tightened 1 basis point to 178 points two days ago, as did
global corporate bonds to 165 basis points.  Corporate Spreads  Canadian corporate yields ended yesterday at 3.68 percent,
up from 3.67 percent the day before and 3.62 at the end of
October, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index,
which covers 709 bonds with a par value of C$279 billion. The
index is headed for a 9.1 percent return this year, versus 15
percent last year.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s broad index of provincial
bonds yielded 3.02 percent yesterday, up from 3 percent the day
before. Yields fell to 2.897 percent on Oct. 19, the lowest
since at least 1992.  Canadian government bonds have returned 6.9 percent this
year, and are headed for an 8.3 percent annual return, the most
since 2008. U.S. Treasuries are headed for a 10.6 percent return
in 2010, compared with 7 percent for global government bonds.  The Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement
yesterday that it will make 4 percent of its purchases in the
17- to 30-year sector. In its first round of purchases, ended in
March, the Fed bought $1.7 trillion in securities, including
$300 billion in Treasuries, in an effort to spur economic growth
strong enough to lower unemployment from near a 26-year high.  Considerable Stimulus  “Speculation that any quantitative easing program would
target the five- to 10-year terms in the U.S. has meant that
five-year Treasuries have performed exceptionally well,”
 Mohammed Ahmed , a rates strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in Toronto, said via e-mail.  Bank of Canada’s Carney reiterated that the country’s
economy has “considerable” stimulus from his 1 percent
benchmark interest rate and further moves to tighten policy
would be “carefully considered.”  Carney also said he’s concerned about “tensions” in
global currency markets and that Canadians must be “vigilant”
about rising debt loads, speaking last week to the Senate
banking committee in Ottawa.  Canadian employers added 15,000 jobs to payrolls in
October, Statistics Canada is likely to say Nov. 5, according to
the median of 24 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. The agency
reported a net loss of 6,600 positions for September, only the
second monthly drop this year. The economy has added 328,000
jobs this year through September. The U.S. has cut jobs on
balance for four straight months, paring gains this year to
613,000.  Yield Forecasts  The International Monetary Fund predicted last month that
Canada’s unemployment rate will fall to 7.5 percent next year,
compared with the 6.2 percent rate seen before the recession in
September 2008.  Interest rates in Canada will rise to 2 percent by the end
of 2011, according to the weighted average in a Bloomberg survey
of 17 economists. That compares with a forecast for U.S. rates
to advance to 0.5 percent by then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
