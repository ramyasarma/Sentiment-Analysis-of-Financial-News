The Australian and New Zealand
dollars headed for a second weekly gain as investors bet both
nations will increase interest rates even as the U.S. and Japan
ease policy further.  New Zealand’s currency traded near the strongest since
April 2008 versus the greenback as traders this week added to
bets policy makers will raise borrowing costs over the next 12
months. Australia’s dollar traded above parity with the U.S.
currency after the Reserve Bank said economic growth will
accelerate next year and the so-called Aussie’s advance will
help slow inflation.  “In the current environment where volatility is high and
risk taking is going to rise, there is some upward pressure on
the Aussie and the kiwi against the major currencies like the
yen and U.S. dollar,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation’s
largest lender.  Australia’s currency traded at $1.0137 as of 11:44 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0149 in New York yesterday, set for a 3.1 percent
advance this week. The currency bought 82.03 yen from 81.95,
headed for a 3.7 percent gain since Oct. 29.  New Zealand’s dollar was at 79.41 U.S. cents from 79.45,
poised for a 3.6 percent advance this week. The so-called kiwi
bought 64.27 yen from 64.15. The currency rose to 79.76 cents
yesterday, the highest since April 2008.  ‘Very Strong’  “Investment intentions in the resources sector are very
strong, and the pipeline of work to be done is large,” the
Reserve Bank of Australia said in its quarterly report today.  The RBA reiterated its forecast that economic growth will
accelerate to 3.75 percent by the end of next year, climbing to
4 percent by the end of 2012. Consumer prices will rise 2.75
percent through June 2012, the RBA said. The central bank had
estimated inflation of 3.25 percent through mid-2011.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in  Australia  and
3 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will increase its benchmark
rate by 92 basis points over the next year, according to a
Credit Suisse AG index. The prediction was 77 basis points at
the start of the week.  -Editors: Nicholas Reynolds, Rocky Swift  To contact the reporter on this story:
