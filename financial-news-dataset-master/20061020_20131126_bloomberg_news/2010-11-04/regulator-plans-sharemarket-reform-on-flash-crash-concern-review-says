Australia’s corporate regulator has
released reforms to control the sharemarket, including trading
halts during extreme price movements and greater transparency,
amid concern the nation is vulnerable to a U.S.-style flash
crash, the Australian Financial Review said.  The changes will apply to every stockbroker in the country
and may include fund managers and indirect brokers, the Review
said in the report, which cited Shane Tregillis, commissioner of
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
