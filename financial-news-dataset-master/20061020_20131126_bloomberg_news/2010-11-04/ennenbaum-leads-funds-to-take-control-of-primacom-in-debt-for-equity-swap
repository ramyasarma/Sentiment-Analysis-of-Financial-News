PrimaCom Management GmbH’s lenders
including Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC took over the German
 cable company  in a debt-for-equity swap.  Tennenbaum, a Santa Monica, California-based hedge fund,
and London-based collateralized loan fund manager Alcentra Group
Ltd. are among junior lenders that agreed to write down
PrimaCom’s loans in exchange for its equity, according to a
statement from its financial adviser One Square Advisors. They
will get all the shares in holding company Medfort Sarl, which
bought PrimaCom from former parent PrimaCom AG in July.  The lenders also agreed to provide 30 million euros ($43
million) through a second-lien loan to allow the company to
expand its business.  Berlin-based PrimaCom arranged a 400 million-euro facility
in November 2007 that included 120 million euros of junior-
ranking mezzanine loans, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
