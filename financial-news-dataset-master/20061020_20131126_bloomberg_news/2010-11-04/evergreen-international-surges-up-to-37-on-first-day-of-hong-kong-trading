Evergreen International Holdings Ltd. 
rose 26 percent on its first day of trading in Hong Kong after
the Chinese menswear maker’s initial public offering was 1,231
times subscribed.  Evergreen International  gained HK$1.20 to close at HK$5.80
as of 4 p.m. in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose
1.6 percent.  “Equity managers are scrambling to get exposure to Asia,”
said Tey Tze Ming, a market strategist at Saxo Capital Markets
Pte in Singapore. “Since the market is doing very well, the
IPOs tend to be oversubscribed and a lot of that is driven by
the hot flows coming into Asia with so much liquidity awash in
the U.S.”  Investor demand for companies tied to economic growth in
China is driving more IPOs to Hong Kong, helping companies raise
a record $22.4 billion last month, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. China’s gross domestic product is forecast to rise 10
percent in 2010 and 9 percent in 2011.  Evergreen International  set its initial public offering
price at HK$4.60 per share, the top end of the range, according
to the company’s Nov. 3 statement. About 244 million  shares 
changed hands in trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
