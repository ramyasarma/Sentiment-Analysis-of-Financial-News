CBS Corp. , owner of the most-watched
U.S. broadcast network, said it plans to buy back $1.5 billion
of its shares and reported third-quarter profit that rose 53
percent on stronger advertising sales.  The repurchase is the first announced since September 2007
by CBS, which cut its  dividend  by 81 percent in early 2009 to
save cash. Class B common stock will be bought back starting in
January, the New York-based company said today in a statement.  CBS was aided by lower costs and a 10 percent jump in
advertising sales, driven by the CBS broadcast network, local TV
stations and radio. The company may draw $130 million in sales
from political advertising in the fourth quarter, estimates  Alan Gould , an analyst at Evercore Partners. Two-thirds of CBS’s
revenue stems from ad sales, the  most  among U.S. media companies
with broadcast networks.  “We are benefitting greatly from our return of advertising
to historical levels,” Chief Executive Officer  Leslie Moonves 
said on a conference call.  Net income  increased to $317.3 million, or 46 cents a
share, from $207.6 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier.
Excluding gains related to asset sales and tax benefits, profit
was 35 cents a share, topping the 32-cent average of 20 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Adjusted earnings exclude a $90.2 million settlement from a
disposed business, $18.2 million in tax benefits, restructuring
charges and other items.  Shares Rise  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , rose 12 cents
to $17.78 in  late trading  after U.S. markets closed. The shares
had gained 37 cents to $17.66 today in regular New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading  before the results were announced.
The shares have climbed 26 percent this year.  Revenue  fell 1.6 percent to $3.3 billion, as CBS had fewer
sales of TV shows into syndication in the U.S. Analysts expected
revenue of $3.36 billion, the average of 17  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  To bolster its revenue beyond advertising, CBS is pursuing
fees from cable operators for over-the-air broadcast stations
that used to be free. The company signed a 10-year agreement in
August with  Comcast Corp. , the biggest U.S. cable operator, that
provides compensation for carrying signals from CBS stations.  Ad sales at the CBS network, No. 1 in ratings since the TV
season started in September, were up 7 percent.  Adjusted operating income at the local TV and radio
stations rose 59 percent to $170.5 million. Ad sales at the TV
stations gained 25 percent because of purchases by carmakers and
financial companies and by political campaigns ahead of this
week’s U.S. elections.  Spending on political campaigns has local TV station ad
sales on a pace for a gain of more than 20 percent from a year
earlier so far in the fourth quarter, Moonves said.  CBS said it ended the third quarter with $1.07 billion in
 cash , up from $716.7 million at the end of 2009. Moonves said
the share buyback announced today doesn’t preclude the company
from boosting the dividend in the future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
