Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-
biggest lender, appointed  Martin Zielke  to the management board
to take over the retail banking unit from  Achim Kassow .  Kassow, 44, will concentrate on overseeing central and
eastern Europe, Frankfurt-based Commerzbank said in an e-mailed
statement today. Zielke, 47, previously the head of group
finance, will take on the new post immediately, the bank said.  Zielke takes over as Commerzbank works to complete the
integration of Dresdner Bank, which boosted its retail customers
to 11 million and market share to 7 percent. The unit, which
reported first-half  operating profit  of 49 million euros ($70
million), aims to increase earnings to 1 billion euros by 2012
with a combination of cost cuts, higher revenue and lower
provisions for loan defaults.  “After reaching substantial milestones for the integration
of the retail client business, it’s now about consequently
bringing the business in central and eastern Europe on a
sustainable growth path,” Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
