Telecom Corp. of  New Zealand , the
nation’s biggest phone company, said first-half profit fell 32
percent amid falling prices and rising costs.  Net income fell to NZ$165 million ($126 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31, from NZ$243 million a year,
Auckland-based Telecom said in a statement to the New Zealand
stock exchange. Earnings included an NZ$18 million gain from the
sale of the consumer unit of its Australian subsidiary AAPT Ltd.
and NZ$39 million of dividends from Southern Cross Cables.  Full-year net income is likely to be between NZ$330 million
and NZ$370 million, matching earlier forecasts, the company said.
Forecast full-year operating earnings or profit before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization are unchanged at NZ$1.72
billion to NZ$1.78 billion.  Operating earnings fell 0.2 percent to NZ$870 million in
the half year as sales declined 3.3 percent to NZ$2.58 billion,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
