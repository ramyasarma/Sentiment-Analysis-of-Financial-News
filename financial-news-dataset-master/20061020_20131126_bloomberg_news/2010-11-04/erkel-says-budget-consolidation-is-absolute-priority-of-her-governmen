German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
that budget consolidation remains the government’s “absolute
priority” even after the tax-revenue outlook was raised.  The government is undertaking “massive efforts” to adhere
to a debt-brake rule that puts legal limits on Germany’s
deficit, Merkel told reporters in Berlin today. While there is
no room for tax cuts, the public will feel the benefit of
government plans to simplify the tax system, she said.  Germany’s total tax revenue for the period 2010 to 2012
will be 61 billion euros ($87 billion) more than estimated in
May, boosted by surging economic growth, the government’s tax
panel said today in its biannual review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
