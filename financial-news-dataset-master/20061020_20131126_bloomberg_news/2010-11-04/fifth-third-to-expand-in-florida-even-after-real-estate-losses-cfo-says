Fifth Third Bancorp , Ohio’s largest
lender, said an ill-timed move into Florida won’t prevent it
from pursuing growth opportunities in the state.  “Our timing of our entering the Florida market was not the
best by any stretch of the imagination,” Chief Financial
Officer  Daniel Poston  said today in a presentation at the
BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference. “In the long
run, those acquisitions and our presence in Florida will be a
significant benefit.”  Fifth Third reported a second straight profit in the third
quarter. Commercial-mortgage losses in Florida and Michigan
accounted for 66 percent of total losses on such loans, Fifth
Third said Oct. 21. Regulators have shut at least  27 lenders  in
Florida this year as banks take losses on loans tied to real
estate.  Fifth Third is seeking to become first, second or third by
deposits in more markets, Poston said. The bank may open
branches or acquire other lenders, he said.  “Florida and in the Southeast are markets that could
benefit from additional investment,” Poston said.  Fifth Third, based in Cincinnati, rose 35 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $13.40 at 4:05 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading. It has climbed more than  37 percent 
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
