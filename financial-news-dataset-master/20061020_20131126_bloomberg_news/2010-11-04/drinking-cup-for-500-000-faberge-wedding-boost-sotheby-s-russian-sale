A Soviet realist painting depicting
two female workers raising a red flag over Moscow fetched $1.5
million at  Sotheby’s  in New York today.  Painted in 1950 by  Yuri Pimenov , the optimistic 8.4-foot-
tall canvas “First of May Celebration” led the $14.4 million
sale of Russian art and Faberge objects.  Pimenov’s canvas, which went to an anonymous buyer bidding
by telephone, sold for three times the presale low estimate and
set an auction record for the artist.  While 30 percent of Russian art lots failed to find buyers,
many of those that sold doubled and tripled their presale
estimates, igniting bidding wars.  Aleksey Kravchenko’s canvas “Indian Fairytale,” created
in the 1920s and inspired by a trip to India and Sri Lanka,
fetched $1.48 million, nearly reaching its presale high
estimate. Prices include a buyer’s commission.  A group of red-robed lamas depicted on paper by Alexandre
Iacovleff in 1932 sold for $782,500. That set an auction record
for the artist, who made frequent expeditions in Asia and
Africa.  The sale’s second part included 83 lots of Faberge and
Russian enamels from an anonymous private collection; only eight
lots failed to find buyers.  Drink Up  The session’s top lot, an ornate Russian drinking vessel
known as a “kovsh,” took in $518,500, more than doubling its
presale low estimate. Made with gilded silver and enamel, it
depicts in tiny detail a wedding feast, including the bride’s
crown and dress ornament.  Another kovsh, shaped as a bird with a golden beak and made
by Faberge, fetched $242,500, more than four times its $60,000
low estimate.  Half of the buyers were Russian and half were American,
said Karen Kettering, Sotheby’s vice president of Russian works
of art.  To contact the reporter of this story:
