Tenaris SA , the world’s largest maker
of seamless pipes, said third-quarter profit gained 33 percent
as energy companies boosted drilling in North America.  Net income  rose to $304.8 million, or 52 cents per American
depositary receipt, from $229.9 million, or 39 cents, a year
earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said today in a statement.  Revenue from North America, Tenaris’s  biggest market ,
climbed 65 percent to $848.7 million, while sales in the Middle
East and Africa fell 6 percent. Rising oil and gas prices
spurred energy producers to complete 123 U.S. wells a day during
the July through September period, a 45 percent increase from a
year earlier, the American Petroleum Institute said Oct. 26.  “Under these market conditions, we expect revenues and
operating income to increase gradually in the fourth quarter and
more strongly in the first half of 2011,” Tenaris said.  Sales in Mexico declined in the quarter because of reduced
activity at Chicontepec and Burgos and hurricane disruptions,
Tenaris said.  North America is a leading performer this quarter for
Tenaris “because it starts off from a very low point from last
year,”  Christian Reos , an analyst with brokerage Allaria
Ledesma said in a Nov. 1 telephone interview. “Volumes and
prices are up” as activity improves in the region, he said.  Tenaris rose 92 cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $43.46
at 5:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading . The
earnings report was released after the close of regular trading
in North American markets. The shares have climbed 10 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
