Finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum will call for countries to reduce
excessive economic imbalances and pursue “sound fiscal
management” to combat uncertainty in the global economy, Dow
Jones Newswires reported.  A working draft of the statement to be released by
officials meeting in Kyoto, Japan, on Nov. 5-6, said current-
account imbalances should be kept at “sustainable levels,”
according to Dow Jones. The draft language was the same used at
a meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs in South Korea last
month, Dow Jones reported.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  aims to use the
APEC meeting to press his case for current-account deficit or
surplus targets of less than 4 percent of gross domestic
product. The proposal is also on the agenda for a G-20 political
leaders summit in Seoul next week.  The draft language doesn’t include a numerical target, Dow
Jones reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
