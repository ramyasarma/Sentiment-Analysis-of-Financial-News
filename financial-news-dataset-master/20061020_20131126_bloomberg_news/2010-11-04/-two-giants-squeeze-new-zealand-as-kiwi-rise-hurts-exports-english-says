New Zealand Finance Minister Bill
English said he is concerned about the strength of the nation’s
currency, which rose to a 29-month high against the U.S. dollar,
and the impact of the gains on exports.  The currency rose after a report that the third-quarter
jobless rate fell to 6.4 percent, lower than expected by
economists. The unemployment gauge is still too high and is
likely to continue to decline, English said in an interview
today in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
