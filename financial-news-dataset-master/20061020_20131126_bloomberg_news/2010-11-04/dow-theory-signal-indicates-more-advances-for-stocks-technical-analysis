Yesterday’s close by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average at a new high for the year suggests U.S.
stocks will extend their advance, said Chuck Carlson, chief
executive officer of Horizon Investment Services LLC.  The  30-stock average  surpassed its previous 2010 high a day
after the Dow Jones Transportation Average achieved the same
milestone. Under Dow Theory, which stems from observations made
by Wall Street Journal founder Charles Dow during the late
1800s, advances by both the transportation and the industrial
average beyond their most recent peaks “confirm” that stocks
can continue to rally.  Horizon Investment Services, based in Hammond, Indiana,
uses Dow Theory to manage $160 million and is buying stocks to
reduce the cash positions of equity funds it manages, Carlson
said in an interview. In funds that can be invested entirely in
stocks, cash positions will fall to about 15 percent from a
range of 19 percent to 23 percent in response to the Dow Theory
signal, he said.  “When you have those two above previous significant highs,
it’s a bullish indication under Dow Theory,” Carlson said.
“Any pullback in the market now, because you’ve had confirmed
these new highs by the industrials and transports, we would view
as a pullback within a bull market.”  The Dow average rose 26.41 points, or 0.2 percent,
yesterday, to 11,215.13, its highest close since Sept. 19, 2008,
after the Federal Reserve said it will buy as much as $600
billion of government bonds to aid the economic recovery. It
gained 190.08 points, or 1.7 percent, to 11,405.21 at 1 p.m. in
New York today,  led by  Caterpillar Inc., the world’s largest
maker of construction equipment, and Bank of America Corp.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the main benchmark for
American equities, has yet to close above its 2010 high of
1,217.28 on April 23. The index rose as much as 1.6 percent to
1,217.52 today as a 2 percent jump in the price of crude oil
lifted energy producers and Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of
mobile-phone chips, forecast profit and sales higher than the
average analyst estimates.  After rebounding 71 percent from a 12-year low in March
2009, the Dow average fell as much as 14 percent from its April
26 closing level amid concern that U.S. unemployment near the
highest since the 1980s and less spending by indebted European
countries would hurt global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
