The owners of the Citigroup tower in
London’s Canary Wharf will seek to sell the building for more
than 1 billion pounds ($1.61 billion) to pay back debt, the
Financial Times said, without citing anyone.  The building was bought by Propinvest and Quinlan Private
from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc for 1 billion pounds in
2007, the report said.  The sale is believed to have been prompted by the banks
that funded the purchase, the report said. There is about 875
million pounds of senior debt against the tower, and a further
200 million pounds owing from an interest-rate swap agreement,
the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
