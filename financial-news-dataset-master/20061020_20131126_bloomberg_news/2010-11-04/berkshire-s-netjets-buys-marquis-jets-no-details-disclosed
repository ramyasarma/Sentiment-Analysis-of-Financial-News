NetJets Inc., the luxury aviation
business owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ,
agreed to purchase Marquis Jet, a provider of prepaid cards for
private air travel, as flights and sales pick up.  Marquis Jet became a wholly owned subsidiary, NetJets said
in a statement without providing details on the terms. Marquis
has been providing cards for access to NetJets planes since 2001
and accounted for 12 percent of NetJets’ 2009 revenue.  “NetJets is seeing improvements across the board with
flight activity and sales to new owners continuing to
strengthen,” the company said in an e-mail.  The move may indicate that NetJets expects demand to
improve further and is preparing a better way to handle sales,
said  Meyer Shields , a Baltimore-based analyst with Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. The acquisition will bring the marketing service
“in house” and help curb expenses, he said.  The acquisition of Marquis “will provide the most
competitive pricing structure in the marketplace,” Columbus,
Ohio-based NetJets said in the statement. The move is part of a
10-year plan that includes consolidation of the company’s U.S.
operations and an agreement in October to buy as many as 125 new
planes from Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA.  Fractional Ownership  NetJets provides fractional ownership programs that allow
customers to acquire a percentage of an aircraft and flight
hours. Under the companies’ partnership, Marquis leased and
purchased fractional interests and management services from
NetJets and resold them to customers in the form of a prepaid
card, entitling them to 25 hours of flight time.  Companies that rely on private jets are using more charter
services rather than keeping their own private fleets, Michele
Martinez, vice president of commercial and military operations
for CSI Aviation Services Inc., said in a statement yesterday.  CSI Aviation , the biggest U.S. air charter broker, said it
saw executive jet charters increase 14 percent in the 12 months
through October.  NetJets’ revenue increased 17 percent in the first half of
2010 from a year earlier, Berkshire Hathaway said in a filing in
August. NetJets is working to reduce operating costs, Berkshire
Hathaway said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
