The billionaire  Wilbur Ross  will
donate $10 million for a library in Yale School of Management’s
new building.  The gift will help fund construction of the $189 million
facility, scheduled to open in 2013. Yale University, in New
Haven, Connecticut, announced the pledge today in an e-mail.  Ross, 72, a trustee of the Yale School of Management, is
chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based WL Ross &
Co., which specializes in reorganizing distressed companies. He
received a bachelor’s degree from Yale University in 1959, and
went to Harvard Business School in Boston for his master’s of
business administration degree because Yale didn’t have a
business school at the time, Ross said in the statement.  “Since joining the Yale SOM board, I have become convinced
that the quality of both faculty and students is world class and
that they deserve a campus of equal quality,” Ross said.  Yale School of Management opened in 1974 and is the
youngest of six business schools in the Ivy League, a group of
eight private U.S. colleges in the northeast. The new building
is being designed by  Norman Foster , architect of London’s
“Gherkin” tower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
