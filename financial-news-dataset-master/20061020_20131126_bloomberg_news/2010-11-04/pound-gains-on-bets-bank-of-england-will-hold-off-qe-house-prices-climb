The pound advanced against the dollar
and yen as house prices rose more than forecast, adding to
speculation the Bank of England will resist following the
Federal Reserve and keep its asset-purchase program unchanged.  Sterling also rose against the Swiss franc. U.K. house
prices rose 1.8 percent in October from a month earlier, Halifax
said, beating the 0.6 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Central bank Governor  Mervyn King 
will keep asset-purchases at 200 billion pounds ($324 billion)
today, 36 of 38 economists predicted in a separate poll.  “It’s fairly unlikely the Bank of England will extend its
program this month,” said  Adrian Schmidt , a currency strategist
at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. “The data in the U.K.
has been strong enough of late for them to hold off for the
moment. That should provide some support for the pound for now,
although we think there is still a decent prospect that we will
see another round of quantitative easing next year from the
central bank.”  The pound rose 0.6 percent to $1.6184 as of 10:37 a.m. in
London after surging to 1.6206, its highest since January.
Sterling strengthened 0.4 percent to 131.92 yen and was little
changed at 88.01 pence per euro from 87.92 pence yesterday. The
U.K currency snapped a two-day decline against the Swiss
currency, strengthening to 1.5665 francs.  The Federal Reserve yesterday announced it will buy an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June in a bid to
reduce unemployment and avert deflation.  U.K. 30-year government bonds declined, pushing the yield
up eight basis points to 4.16 percent. The yield on the 10-year
gilt rose five basis points to 3.01 percent. The 4.75 percent
security due March 2020 lost 0.45, or 4.5 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 113.755. Two-year yields advanced three basis
points to 0.70 percent.  The currency has gained 2.1 percent against the dollar and
1.5 percent against the yen since the Oct. 26 release of data
showing the economy grew faster in the third quarter than
economists had forecast. That prompted some investors to trim
bets the central bank will expand quantitative easing today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
