Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, said 2011 earnings may fall
short of analysts’ estimates as the company incurs costs on the
acquisition of two American International Group Inc. businesses.  Next year’s profit, excluding the results of policies sold
before the company went public and some investments, will
probably be $5.60 to $6 a share, the Newark, New Jersey-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. The average estimate
of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $6.53.  Chief Executive Officer  John Strangfeld  is using the
capital he accumulated after the financial crisis to add clients
outside the U.S. With the September deal to buy AIG’s Star Life
Insurance Co. and Edison Life Insurance Co., Prudential will
boost a Japanese business it has built over two decades and face
“integration and transaction costs” next year, the company
said, without providing specifics.  The deal is “adding earnings growth” in the future, said
 Randy Binner , an analyst the FBR Capital Markets, who  recommends
buying  Prudential stock. “This insurance business is tough. A
low-risk acquisition is a good acquisition.”  Prudential gained $1.48, or 2.7 percent, to $55.59 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
fallen 1.7 percent since Sept. 29, the day before it announced
the AIG transaction.  MetLife Rivalry  Prudential is extending its rivalry with  MetLife Inc. , the
biggest U.S. life insurer, as the two firms expand abroad and
take market share from bailed-out rivals in their home market.
New York-based MetLife completed the $16.2 billion acquisition
of AIG’s American Life Insurance Co. this week, giving the firm
more clients from Russia to Chile and a business in Japan that
Chief Financial Officer  William Wheeler  called “a cash
machine.”  Japan, the world’s second-largest life insurance market,
already contributes more than a fifth of Prudential’s revenue.
Operating profit in the country was $1.6 billion last year,
Prudential has  said . The $4.8 billion AIG deal is Strangfeld’s
second purchase in Japan since  taking over  as CEO in 2008.  Prudential said its 2011 profit estimate would be $6.15 to
$6.55 a share if it excluded costs tied to the AIG deal and the
integration of the new businesses.  Annuities Gain  Prudential’s third-quarter net income climbed 15 percent to
$1.24 billion, the company said yesterday. The insurer booked a
gain in its annuities business as the rising stock market
allowed Strangfeld to lower reserves against minimum-return
guarantees to clients.  Profit for 2010 will be $5.80 to $5.90, the company said,
compared with its previous forecast of $5.40 to $5.70. The
average estimate is $5.93 a share.  Strangfeld, 56, will issue less debt and equity for the AIG
deal than previously planned, and use more cash, the company
said yesterday. The insurer now plans to sell about $1 billion
in stock and $1 billion in bonds, compared with a prior
projection of $2.5 billion in securities. The company will use
$2.2 billion of capital it already has on the deal. It will also
take on $600 million of debt held by the units.  Prudential expects to have $4 billion to $4.5 billion of
cash at yearend and $2.5 billion to $3 billion at the end of
2011, it said today.  Strangfeld slashed Prudential’s  dividend  in 2008 when the
credit crunch interrupted insurers’ traditional sources of
funding. Prudential and MetLife shunned bailouts, while AIG took
a rescue valued at $182.3 billion. Last year, when markets
recovered, Strangfeld raised capital with debt and equity
offerings and the sale of a $4.5 billion stake in a brokerage.  Hartford, AIG  The capital helped Prudential as it jumped to No. 1 among
sellers of variable annuities in the U.S. last year. Insurers
that took U.S. aid, including  Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc.  and New York-based AIG, scaled back to conserve funds.
Prudential returned to  profit  last year with $3.12 billion of
net income, compared with a net loss of $1.12 billion in 2008.  Prudential entered Japan in 1987 and expanded its business
in 2001 with the acquisition of a failed Japanese carrier that
it renamed Gibraltar Life Insurance Co. Strangfeld added another
bankrupt insurer, Yamato Life Insurance Co., last year after
winning an auction. Prudential also has business in South Korea,
Taiwan and Brazil. The deal for Star and Edison will be
completed in the first quarter, the firm said Sept. 30.  Japan accounted for about 17 percent of the world’s life
insurance sales last year, according to a  study  by Swiss
Reinsurance Co. Premium volume was $399 billion in 2009, down
0.8 percent when adjusted for inflation, Swiss Re said. In the
U.S., the world’s biggest market, premiums dropped 15 percent to
$492 billion, according to the Zurich-based reinsurer.  Prudential’s premiums, policy charges and fee income from
Gibraltar and other Japanese operations rose 21 percent to  $6.99
billion  last year. Prudential posted total 2009 revenue of  $32.7
billion .  To contact the reporters on this story:
