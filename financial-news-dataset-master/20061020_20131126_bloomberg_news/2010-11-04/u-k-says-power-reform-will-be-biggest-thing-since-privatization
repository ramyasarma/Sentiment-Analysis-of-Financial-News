Britain’s power market reform will be
“the biggest thing since liberalization and privatization of
the electricity market,” Energy Minister Charles Hendry told
delegates today at the annual lunch of the Association of
Electricity Producers in London.  The U.K. government will seek ways in which to change the
electricity market to encourage low-carbon investment into the
nation’s energy infrastructure. Ofgem, the market regulator,
estimates 200 billion pounds ($325 billion) is needed to replace
power stations due to close and to upgrade cables.  The government said it will consult on issues such as
carbon pricing, setting emissions limits and capacity payments
later this year to publish a draft law in the second quarter of
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
