The default rate for junk-rated U.S.
corporate debt is expected to drop to 2.2 percent by this time
next year, with hotel, gaming and leisure companies seen to
perform the worst, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report
today.  Missed payments on speculative-grade debt fell to 3.6
percent in October, down from 4 percent in September and 14.6
percent a year earlier, the New York-based credit rating company
said. Moody’s sees U.S. default rates dropping to 2.9 percent by
yearend as companies find it easier to borrow. The forecast is
lower than Standard & Poor’s estimate of a 2.4 percent default
rate in the year ended September 2011.  “Defaults continue to come in near, but generally below,
our expectations,” Albert Metz,  Moody’s  director of credit
policy research, said in today’s statement.  Globally, Moody’s expects default rates to decline to 2.8
percent by yearend and 1.9 percent by next October.  Five corporate debt issuers rated by Moody’s defaulted in
October. All except one were in North America, the company said.  High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and less than BBB- by S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
