Canada’s rejection of  BHP Billiton
Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan
Inc. wasn’t politically motivated, Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said.  “That it’s a political decision is completely false,”
Clement said today in a parliamentary debate in Ottawa. “This
was a decision made pursuant to the provisions of the  Investment
Canada Act .”  Clement said he was obligated under Canadian law to give
the Melbourne-based company a 30-day appeal period and will be
able to elaborate on the reasons for his decision after it
expires.  The rejection by Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s
government, which has sought to attract foreign investment,
marks only the second time a takeover was formally blocked in
Canada in the past 25 years. The government came under pressure
from the province of Saskatchewan, which argued Potash Corp.’s
sale would cut jobs and tax revenue and surrender control of a
“strategic” resource.  Potash Corp.  dropped $4.72, or 3.2 percent, to $140.78 at
11:41 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares earlier tumbled 4.2 percent to $139.37, the biggest
intraday decline since Aug. 11. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-
based company  gained  34 percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
