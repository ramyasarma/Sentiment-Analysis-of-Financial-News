More Americans than forecast filed
applications for unemployment benefits last week, showing the
labor market will take time to improve.  Jobless  claims  rose by 20,000 to 457,000 in the week ended
Oct. 30 from a revised 437,000 the prior week, Labor Department
figures showed today in Washington. The  total number  of people
receiving unemployment insurance fell, while those on extended
payments increased.  The pace of firings has held within a narrow range in 2010,
showing employers continue to focus on cutting costs more than a
year into the economic recovery. Calling progress toward lower
joblessness and faster growth “disappointingly slow,” Federal
Reserve policy makers yesterday announced plans to bolster the
recovery through another round of large-scale asset purchases.  Claims have “been relatively steady, consistent with
lackluster to moderate labor market conditions,” said  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in St.
Petersburg, Florida.  Another Labor Department report showed worker productivity
rose more than forecast in the third quarter as companies
redoubled efforts to rein in costs amid signs the recovery was
cooling.  A measure of employee output per hour increased at a 1.9
percent annual rate after falling 1.8 percent in the previous
three months. Labor costs adjusted for efficiency gains
unexpectedly dropped at a 0.1 percent pace.  Stock-index futures and Treasuries held earlier gains after
the reports. The December contract on the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  rose 0.9 percent to 1,208.3 at 8:57 a.m. in New York. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to
price, fell to 2.50 percent from 2.57 percent late yesterday.  Exceeds Median Forecast  Economists forecast claims would rise to 442,000 from a
previously estimated 434,000 the prior week, according to the
median of 50 projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates
ranged from 430,000 to 455,000.  The figures precede tomorrow’s Labor Department report on
October employment. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project
companies added 80,000 positions. The unemployment rate was
probably 9.6 percent for a third month, according to the survey.  The  four-week moving average  for claims, a less volatile
measure, rose to 456,000 last week from 454,000.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 42,000 in the week ended Oct. 23 to 4.34 million.  Extended Benefits  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended and emergency benefits under
federal programs. Those who’ve used up their traditional
benefits and are now collecting emergency and extended payments
increased by about 357,700 to 5.01 million in the week ended
Oct. 16.  The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits
fell to 3.4 percent in the week ended Oct. 23 from 3.5 percent.  The labor market and the economy were top concerns for
voters heading into the Nov. 2 congressional elections in which
Republicans gained control of the U.S. House and narrowed the
Democratic majority in the Senate.  To spur the economy and encourage job creation, the Fed
yesterday said it will purchase an additional $600 billion in
Treasury securities by the end of June. The Fed will buy about
$75 billion a month and “will adjust the program as needed to
best foster maximum employment and price stability,” the Fed’s
Open Market Committee said in a statement in Washington.  Fed on Jobs  “Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and
measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low,” the FOMC
said. Progress in reaching its dual mandate of stable prices and
low unemployment “has been disappointingly slow,” it said.  Smurfit-Stone Container Corp.  is cutting more than 450 jobs
in its selling, general and administrative areas this year and
expects to make more reductions over the next two years, Chief
Operating Officer Steven Klinger said on a conference call Nov.
1. The second-largest U.S. maker of corrugated packaging emerged
from bankruptcy protection in June.  Some companies plan to expand. Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based
 Rockwell Collins  Inc., a maker of cockpit instruments and
radios, last week said it’ll add 800 people, boosting staff by 4
percent during the next 12 months. Ford Motor Co., the second-
largest U.S. automaker, said it will spend $850 million and add
1,200 jobs in Michigan by 2013 as sales rebound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
