Raw-sugar prices jumped to a 29-year
high on forecasts for lower global production after adverse
weather damaged crops in Brazil, the world’s biggest producer.  Global output will be 167 million metric tons in the year
that began this month, down from an estimate of 173 million
tons, Paris-based Sucres et Denrees SA said yesterday.
Production in Brazil’s Center South tumbled 30 percent in the
first half of October from a year earlier, Unica, an industry
association, said on Oct. 28.  “People are very concerned about the Brazilian crop, for
this year and for next,” said  Jonathan Kingsman , the managing
director of Lausanne, Switzerland-based sugar broker Kingsman
SA.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 5 percent,
to settle at 31.66 cents a pound at 2:01 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price reached 31.81 cents, the
highest level for a most-active contract since Jan. 9, 1981.  The commodity gained for the seventh straight session, the
longest rally since July 2009.  Global consumption this year will be 166.2 million tons,
Sucden said. In the past three month, Brazil and Russia were the
producers hurt most by adverse weather, the company said.  “The main problem is the lack of selling,” Kingsman said.
“When people need to buy, there is no supply.”  India, the second-biggest producer and largest consumer,
may export less than forecast, and shipments should be spread
out to prevent global prices from slumping, a milling group said
yesterday.  “India could also be a factor in sugar’s rise,” Kingsman
said. “If they are going to control or limit exports, that
might be worrying some people.”  Sugar has more than doubled since touching a 13-month low
on May 7.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery climbed
$27.70, or 3.7 percent, to $776.50 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Earlier,
the price reached $777.40, the highest level since at least
1989. The commodity has gained 9.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
