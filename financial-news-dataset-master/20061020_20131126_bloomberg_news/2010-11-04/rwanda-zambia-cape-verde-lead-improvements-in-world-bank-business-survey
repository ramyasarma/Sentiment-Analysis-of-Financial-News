Rwanda, Cape Verde and  Zambia  led the
27 sub-Saharan African countries that improved their position in
the World Bank’s Doing Business survey, a report that measures
the ease of conducting business in 183 countries.  Cape Verde , an archipelago off the continent’s Atlantic
coast, along with the two other countries counted among the top
10 most-improved business climates in the World Bank’s  2011
study , the Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  The Indian Ocean island nation of  Mauritius  ranked as
Africa’s most business-friendly country, at 20th on the report’s
overall standings, it said.  Ghana, which is set to become West Africa’s newest oil
exporter, ranked highest on the continent in terms of access to
credit, while the southeast African agricultural economy of
Malawi “demonstrated itself on a world scale,” in its
improvements in regulating contracts, according to the
statement.  A third of the report’s top 30 reformers since 2005 are in
sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone,
Mali, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Rwanda, Ghana, Mauritius and
Madagascar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
