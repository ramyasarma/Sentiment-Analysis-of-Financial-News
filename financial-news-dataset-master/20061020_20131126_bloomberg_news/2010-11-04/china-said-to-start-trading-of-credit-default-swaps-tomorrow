China will write its first yuan-
denominated credit-default swap tomorrow, said three people
familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified before
a public announcement.  The first of these contracts, called “credit risk
mitigation” products, will be traded by  China Bond Insurance Co. 
and a few Chinese commercial banks, two of the people said.
China Bond Insurance was set up in September 2009 by the
National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors
to help small and medium-sized companies raise debt financing by
improving their credit ratings.  China Bond Insurance Chief Risk Officer Liang Shidong
declined to comment.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editor: John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
