The National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa, which has more than 260,000 members, said the
country needs “much lower” interest rates, a weaker rand and
must tighten exchange controls to restrict the ouflow of funds.  “Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank are failing
to manage our economy to promote growth and development,” the
labor union said in a statement published in the Business Day
newspaper today. The government needs to increase its borrowing
to fund more “community-oriented labor intensive
infrastructure” projects, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
