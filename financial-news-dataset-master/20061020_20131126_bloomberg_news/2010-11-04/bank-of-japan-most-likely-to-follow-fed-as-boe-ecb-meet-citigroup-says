The Bank of Japan is the most likely
central bank to follow the Federal Reserve by increasing asset
purchases this week as part of a quantitative easing plan,
Citigroup Inc. currency strategists said.  While the dollar stayed stronger than 80 yen after the
Fed’s decision to expand its bond-buying plan yesterday, “a
further expansion of monetary policy by the BOJ is still a
possibility and would work hand-in-hand with a foreign-exchange
intervention campaign,” Greg Anderson , a currency strategist in
New York, wrote today in a note to clients.  “The European Central Bank has signaled very loudly that
it will not follow the Fed,” Anderson wrote. In the U.K., “the
most recent growth and inflation data do not make nearly as
strong a case for quantitative easing as U.S. or Japanese
data,” he wrote.  Should the central banks “fail to ease in similar fashion,
they risk further appreciation of their currencies,” Anderson
wrote in the report.  The yen weakened 0.3 percent to 80.85 per dollar at 7:13
a.m. in London. The euro was little changed at $1.4123 and the
pound climbed 0.3 percent to $1.6132.  To contact the reporter on this story:
