euro area,” Fidentiis Equities SV SA said in a note.  Fiat SpA  (F IM) advanced for a second day, rising 2.7
percent to 12.52 euros. UniCredit Research reiterated its
“buy” rating on the carmaker, highlighting in a note that
Chrysler Group LLC’s 37 percent year-on-year increase in volumes
sold in the U.S. in October “represents another support for a
likely upward revision of 2010 guidance.”  Exor SpA  (EXO IM), Fiat’s main shareholder, gained 4.4
percent to 19.84 euros.  Finmeccanica SpA  (FNC IM) dropped 2.9 percent to 9.55

restructuring costs will climb to as much as 12 percent of sales
in 2013 from about 8.8 percent this year.  Telecom Italia SpA  (TIT IM) sank 3.5 percent to 1.06 euros,
the stock’s worst performance in three months, after Italy’s
biggest phone company said nine-month domestic sales fell 7.4
percent to 15 billion euros and Italian mobile revenue dropped
more than 10 percent.  The shares suffered from “weak domestic mobile,” said
 Gian Paolo Rivano , a fund manager at Gesti-Re SGR SpA in Milan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
