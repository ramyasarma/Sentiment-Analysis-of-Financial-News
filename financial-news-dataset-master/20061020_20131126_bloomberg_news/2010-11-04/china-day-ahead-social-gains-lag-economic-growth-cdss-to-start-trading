China’s unprecedented economic growth
over the past 40 years hasn’t produced comparable improvements
in the health and education of its people, a  United Nations 
report on global development said.  China, while first in economic expansion since 1970, ranks
79th out of 135 nations in increasing life expectancy and adding
years of schooling in that period, according to the UN’s Human
Development  Report  2010 released in New York.  “The economy grew at a phenomenal 8 percent a year for
three decades, and monetary poverty measures fell more than 80
percent between 1981 and 2005,” the report said. “Yet this
success was not matched by performance in other dimensions of
human development.”  CDSs Start Today  China plans to start trading in yuan-denominated credit-
default swaps today as the government experiments with
derivatives blamed by some European and U.S. officials for
inflaming the global financial crisis.  State-backed China Bond Insurance Co. will write the first
swaps, to be known as “credit risk mitigation” tools,
according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the details are private.
The securities will be controlled by regulators to limit
leverage and speculation, the people said.  Hu’s $22.7 Billion Visit  Chinese President  Hu Jintao  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  signed contracts on 102 Airbus SAS planes and a $3.5
billion uranium agreement with Areva SA as part of a 16 billion-
euro ($22.7 billion) round of trade deals.  The two leaders sealed the agreements in a ceremony at the
 Elysee Palace  in Paris after a 45-minute meeting. Hu yesterday
started a three-day  state visit  to France. Chinese Commerce
Minister  Chen Deming  and French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  will meet today at the Paris headquarters of the  Medef 
business union to sign more business contracts.  China Southern Airlines Co., the nation’s largest carrier,
ordered 36 Airbus SAS planes as economic growth stokes travel
demand, including six widebody A330 planes and 30 single-aisle
A320-series aircraft, it said in a Hong Kong stock exchange
statement. The planes have a total list price of $3.8 billion,
according to the statement. Planemakers usually grant discounts
to large customers.  ‘Normalized’ Policy  China should return to a “normalized” monetary policy as
quantitative easing in the U.S. pumps cash into the world’s
fastest-growing major economy and fuels price risks, the central
bank’s research head said.  The stance adopted to counter the financial crisis has
completed its “mission,”  Zhang Jianhua  said at a forum in
Beijing yesterday afternoon. The nation faces inflation risks
and “huge pressure” on asset prices, Zhang said.  Energy-Use Focus  China, the world’s largest greenhouse-gas emitter, should
focus on steel, chemicals and cement industries to improve
energy efficiency, an official with the International Energy
Agency said.  “China made a lot of improvements in the past 15 to 20
years in energy efficiency,”  Richard H. Jones , deputy executive
director of IEA, said in an interview in Shanghai. “Even given
the economy structure, which is heavily weighted toward
manufacturing, the country is still not as efficient as an OECD
country, so there is definitely room to continue improvement.”  U.S. China Adoptions Drop  The number of U.S.  foreign adoptions  is near a six-year low
due to greater barriers overseas and fewer orphans coming from a
 wealthier China , U.S. Special Adviser for Children’s Issues
Susan Jacobs said.  Total adoptions to the U.S. fell last year to 12,753 and
will “be somewhere in that ballpark” in 2010, Jacobs said in a
telephone interview. “Domestic adoptions in China are on the
rise and international adoptions are taking longer, so it’s
harder to adopt there.”  MARKETS:  U.S. stocks gained, sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
