The New Zealand dollar surged to its
highest level since 2008 after a government report showed
employers added more  jobs  than economists forecast, encouraging
the central bank to resume interest-rate increases.  The Aussie extended its gain beyond parity with the
greenback after the Federal Reserve said yesterday it will buy
$600 billion more of Treasuries through June. Australia’s dollar
dropped to a seven-week low against its South Pacific
counterpart after data showed the larger nation’s retail sales
rose less than forecast and its exports fell.  “Australia may be coming to the top of their tightening
cycle, while there’s still a fair amount to come from New
Zealand,” said  Derek Mumford , a director in Sydney at Rochford
Capital, a foreign-exchange risk-management firm. “The
overriding theme is the amount of money being injected into the
global economy, which will fuel asset purchases and commodity
currencies. Risk appetite will benefit.”  The kiwi dollar gained as much as 2.3 percent to 79.76 U.S.
cents, the highest level since April 2008, before trading at
79.56 cents at 11:04 a.m. in New York, compared with 77.99 cents
yesterday. Australia’s currency rallied 0.8 percent to $1.0145,
from $1.0062 yesterday, after touching $1.0148, the highest
level since exchange controls were lifted in 1983.  New Zealand’s  jobless rate  dropped to a seasonally adjusted
6.4 percent in the third quarter, the statistics bureau said
today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 14
economists was for a drop to 6.7 percent.  ‘Strong’ Jobs  “The jobs number was strong across all measures, and the
market will probably start pricing in a hike in March,” in New
Zealand, said  Imre Speizer , a market strategist in Wellington
with Westpac Banking Corp. “The kiwi dollar will likely target
80 cents in the next week or two.”  Benchmark interest rates are 3 percent in New Zealand and
4.75 percent in  Australia , compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets.  The New Zealand dollar appreciated 1.2 percent to A$1.2750
versus the Australian currency after touching A$1.2717, the
strongest level since Sept. 13.  Australia’s  retail sales  rose 0.3 percent in September, the
Bureau of Statistics said today. The median forecast of 23
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.5 percent
gain. Exports fell 2 percent, narrowing the  trade surplus  to
A$1.76 billion ($1.77 billion). Economists had forecast a gap of
A$2 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
