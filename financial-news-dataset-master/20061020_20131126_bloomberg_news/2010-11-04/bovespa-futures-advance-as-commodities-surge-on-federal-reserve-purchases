Brazil’s  Bovespa  index rose for a
fourth day, climbing within 0.8 percent of a record, as oil and
metals prices surged on speculation the Federal Reserve’s
stimulus will bolster demand for raw-materials exports.  Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron ore producer, and
 Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil company,
advanced as metal and oil prices increased.  Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA  and  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  led gains
on the Bovespa index as steelmakers surged.  “A lot of the companies that have done the worst this year
are recovering,” said  Mirela Rappaport , who manages 150 million
reais ($89.8 million) at Investport in Sao Paulo. “The Fed move
feeds the liquidity, so there’s a lot of money coming into the
market.”  The Bovespa index gained 1.5 percent to 72,995.69, the
highest level in more than two years and approaching its May 20,
2008 record of 73,516.81. Forty-nine stocks rose on the index
while 16 fell. The  BM&FBovespa Small Cap index  climbed 1.2
percent to a record 1,469.62. The real gained 1.1 percent to
1.6708 per dollar.  The Fed announced yesterday it will purchase about $75
billion of Treasuries a month through June, for a total of $600
billion, because of “disappointingly slow” progress in
boosting economic growth. Fifty-three of 56 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News predicted the central bank would announce
asset purchases, with 29 forecasting a pledge to buy $500
billion or more.  Commodity Rally  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 commodities gained
as much as 2.4 percent to 591.40, the highest level since
October 2008.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, Brazil’s second-
biggest steelmaker, jumped 4.1 percent to 22.33 reais. CSN, the
third-biggest, gained 3.1 percent to 29.90 reais.  Petrobras climbed 1.9 percent to 27.50 reais.  Retailers trailed the broader market today. The rally by
Brazil’s retailers this year has pushed their valuations to
triple the Bovespa’s, a sign to hedge fund managers at BNY
Mellon Arx Investimentos and JGP SA that it’s time to sell even
as economic growth accelerates.  Lojas Americanas SA , Brazil’s biggest discount retailer,
slipped 1.2 percent to 18.79 reais. Lojas Renner SA dropped 1.1
percent to 65 reais.  The six largest retailers by sales trade at an average 50.5
times 2010 earnings, compared with 14.4 for the Bovespa index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lojas Renner , the best
performer in the benchmark gauge, fetches 28 times profit, the
highest premium to the Bovespa since January 2008.  While prospects for the industry are positive as consumer
spending rises, the stocks are overvalued, said  Bruno Garcia , a
money manager at BNY Mellon Arx, who runs the nation’s fourth-
best performing hedge fund this year. He says Vale is a better
bet.  Vale rose 2.3 percent to 49.35 reais, its biggest advance
in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
