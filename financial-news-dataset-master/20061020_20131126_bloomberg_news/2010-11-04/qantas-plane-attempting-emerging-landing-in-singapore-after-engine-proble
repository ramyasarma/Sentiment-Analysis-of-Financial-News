A  Qantas Airways Ltd.  passenger plane
is attempting an emergency landing in Singapore because of an
engine problem,  Bambang Ervan , a spokesman at the Indonesian
transport ministry, said by telephone in Jakarta today.  The plane took off from Singapore and an explosion occurred
while it was flying over Indonesia’s Batam island, Ervan said.
The plane is dumping fuel to prepare for the emergency landing,
he said. Details about the plane’s number and type aren’t yet
available, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
