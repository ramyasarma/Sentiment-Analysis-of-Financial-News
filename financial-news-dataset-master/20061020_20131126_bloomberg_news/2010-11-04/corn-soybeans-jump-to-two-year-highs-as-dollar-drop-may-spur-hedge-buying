Corn and soybean futures jumped to
the highest prices in two years as plans by the Federal Reserve
to stimulate the economy sent the dollar lower, boosting demand
for commodities as a hedge against inflation.  The  dollar  fell to an 11-month low against a basket of six
currencies after the Fed said yesterday it would buy an
additional $600 billion of Treasuries through June and will keep
interest rates low for an “extended period.” The  Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 commodities rose to the highest level
since Oct. 3, 2008. Corn has jumped 58 percent since the end of
June and soybeans rose 41 percent on reduced global production.  “It’s like the Fed is printing $600 billion of new money,
and that increases inflationary expectations,” said  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.
“It a rush of new investment money into hard assets like
commodities.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $5.90 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $5.9575, the highest level since
Aug. 29, 2008. Prices surged 17 percent in October after hot,
dry weather reduced the size of the U.S. crop.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 37.25 cents, or 3
percent, to close at $12.7475 a bushel in Chicago, after earlier
touching $12.79, the highest level for a most-active contract
since Sept. 3, 2008. The commodity jumped 12 percent in October
on rising U.S. export sales to China.  The U.S. is the world’s largest grower and exporter of both
commodities. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6
billion in 2009, government figures show, followed by soybeans
at $31.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
