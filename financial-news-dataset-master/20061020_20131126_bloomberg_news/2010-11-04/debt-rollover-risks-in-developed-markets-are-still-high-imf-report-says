The  International Monetary Fund  said
Nigeria’s economic growth is expected to be “exceptionally
high” this year thanks to a “strong recovery” in oil
production and growth in other industries.  Still “inflation remains stubbornly high and international
reserves continue to fall as the authorities support the
exchange rate,” W. Scott Rogers, the IMF mission chief for
Nigeria, said in an e-mailed statement today in Washington.  The IMF recommended the country’s central bank “conduct
monetary policy with a view to reducing inflation to a single-
digit level,” according to the statement.  Foreign currency reserves stood at $34.3 billion as of Nov.
15, compared with $34.6 billion at the end of October, the
governor of the central bank, Lamido Sanusi, said yesterday.
Reserves, which were $58 billion in March 2008, have been used
to defend the local currency following an increase in demand for
dollars from local rice and fuel importers, he said.  “The depletion has stopped” because the central bank has
taken necessary action to stop the dwindling of the reserves,
Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga  told reporters today in Abuja.
The country has a “plan” to increase the reserves, he added,
without providing further details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
