Elpida Memory Inc. , the Japanese
chipmaker bailed out by the government last year, plans to slash
semiconductor production by about 25 percent, citing an "abrupt"
drop in prices.  Output, measured in terms of silicon wafers used in chip
manufacturing, will drop to 170,000 a month from 230,000, the
Tokyo-based company said in a statement today. The company
hasn’t decided when to restore production levels, it said.  "It’s unclear how far prices will decline," Elpida
President Yukio Sakamoto said. "We’re doing this to try to keep
prices from falling further."  Prices of the benchmark chip are poised to fall 30 percent
this quarter after tumbling 24 percent in the preceding three
months, according to estimates at DrameXchange.com.  Elpida , which specializes in making the dynamic-random-
access-memory chips that help PCs run multiple programs at the
same time, rose 5.1 percent to close at 803 yen today before the
announcement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
