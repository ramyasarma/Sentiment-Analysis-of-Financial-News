Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., the movie
company that filed for bankruptcy yesterday, said it expects to
have $449 million in free cash flow in 2015 and to be able to
finance new James Bond movies without help from a partner.  Free cash flow, estimated at negative $168 million this
year, will turn positive in 2013 at $160 million, the Los
Angeles-based studio said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
