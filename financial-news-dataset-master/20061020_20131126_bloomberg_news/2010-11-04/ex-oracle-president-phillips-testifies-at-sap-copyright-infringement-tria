Former Oracle Corp. president  Charles Phillips  started testifying at the trial of the company’s
copyright infringement lawsuit against SAP AG, to be followed by
Oracle Chief Executive Officer  Larry Ellison  on Nov. 8.  Oracle, the second-largest maker of software for business
applications behind SAP, sued its competitor in 2007. It seeks
at least $2.3 billion in damages for what a former SAP unit
acknowledges were fraudulent downloads of Oracle software that
infringed Oracle copyrights. The trial began this week in
federal court in Oakland, California.  Ellison said in an Oct. 26 statement that Oracle plans to
produce evidence that Hewlett-Packard Co. CEO  Leo Apotheker  was
involved in an effort to steal Oracle software while at SAP.  HP says Apotheker had a limited role in the SAP software
maintenance unit where the downloads took place, and claims
Ellison is seeking to harass him.  HP yesterday refused to accept service of a subpoena
requiring Apotheker to testify at the trial. SAP said the jury
will be shown a videotaped deposition of Apotheker.  Geoffrey Howard , an Oracle attorney, told U.S. District
Judge  Phyllis Hamilton  that Nov. 8 is his best estimate for when
he will call Ellison as a witness. Hamilton asked about high-
profile witnesses to make arrangements for potential media
interest.  The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
