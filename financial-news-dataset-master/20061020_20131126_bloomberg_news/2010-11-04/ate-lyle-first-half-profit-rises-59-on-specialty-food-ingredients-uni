Tate & Lyle Plc , maker of the low-
calorie sweetener Splenda, said first-half profit advanced 59
percent as sales volumes increased in its specialty food
ingredients division.  Net income for the six months ended Sept. 30 rose to 70
million pounds ($113 million) from 44 million pounds a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. Adjusted
operating profit climbed 32 percent for the specialty food
ingredients unit.  The company, once the world’s biggest sugar refiner,
completed the sale of its refineries in the European Union to
American Sugar Refining Inc. on Sept. 30 to focus on more
profitable units including its global additives and ingredients
business.  “We anticipate that the improvements we’ve seen in the
specialty foods division in the first half will continue for the
rest of the year,” Chief Executive Officer  Javed Ahmed  said in
a conference call. Tate & Lyle expects demand for corn sweetener
to increase in Mexico in the second half, Ahmed said.  Tate & Lyle  rose 5 percent to 514.5 pence as of 8:57 a.m.
in London. The stock has gained 19 percent this year, giving the
London-based company a market value of 2.4 billion pounds.  Editors: Peter Branton, James Cone .  To contact the reporter on this story:
