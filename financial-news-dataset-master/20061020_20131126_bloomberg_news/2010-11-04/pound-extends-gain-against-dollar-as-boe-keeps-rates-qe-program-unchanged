The pound extended an advance against
the dollar and climbed versus the euro after the Bank of England
kept its benchmark interest rate and asset-purchase target
unchanged.  Sterling climbed 1 percent to $1.6233 as of 12:04 p.m. in
London after reaching $1.6237, the most since January. It
strengthened 0.3 percent to 87.62 pence per euro.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor
 Mervyn King , held its bond-purchase plan at 200 billion pounds,
as forecast by 38 of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The others predicted an increase. The bank also kept its
interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
