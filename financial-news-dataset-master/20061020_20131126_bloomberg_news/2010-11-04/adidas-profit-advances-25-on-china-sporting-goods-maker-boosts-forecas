Adidas AG , the world’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, said third-quarter profit rose 25 percent
as the company’s business in China recovered and raised its
outlook for 2010 sales.  Net income  advanced to 266 million euros ($376 million), or
1.27 euros per share, from 213 million euros, or 1.03 euros, a
year earlier, the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company said in
a statement today. That beat the average  estimate  of 12 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg for 256 million euros.  Revenue gained 20 percent to 3.47 billion euros and resumed
growth in China, where it advanced 9 percent, excluding currency
swings. After the company’s Chinese revenue declined in the last
year and a half, hurt by discount sales of inventory from the
Beijing Olympics, Adidas was able to raise prices in the world’s
most populous country.  “Adidas has resolved its China problems and is now
harvesting the benefits,”  Christoph Schlienkamp , an analyst at
Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf, said before today’s figures were
released. Schlienkamp has a “buy”  rating  on the stock.  Group sales will rise by about 8 percent this year, on a
currency neutral basis, Adidas said today, higher than a
previous outlook for a mid-single-digit increase. Adidas expects
earnings per share to rise between 10 percent and 15 percent in
2011, it said today.  Adidas rose 29 cents, or 0.6 percent, to 48.10 euros in
Frankfurt electronic trading yesterday. The stock has  advanced 
27 percent this year, giving Adidas a market value of 10 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
