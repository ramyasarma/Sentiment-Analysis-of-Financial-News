The Kimberley Process, the global
body that monitors sales of so-called conflict diamonds, has yet
to reach a decision on whether exports of gems from Zimbabwe’s
Marange field will be permitted, Boaz Hirsch, the group’s
chairman, told reporters in Jerusalem today.  An agreement may be reached in coming days when some
representatives have consulted their governments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
