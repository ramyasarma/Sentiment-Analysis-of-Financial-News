The  Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries  raised estimates for global oil demand
through to 2014 on growth in Asia, and forecast that alternative
supplies will restrain the world’s need for its crude.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of worldwide crude
production, expects oil consumption to increase 5.1 percent to
89.9 million barrels a day by 2014 from this year. That’s
800,000 barrels a day more than it predicted last year. OPEC cut
the demand forecast for its own crude by 900,000 barrels a day
on rising use of natural gas liquids and non-conventional oils
such as biofuels.  “A swifter-than-expected recovery from the global
recession has led to positive impacts upon oil demand,” the
group’s Vienna-based secretariat said in its annual World Oil
Outlook report today. “The expanding role that non-crude forms
of liquid supply will play in satisfying demand is an important
feature.”  Producers outside OPEC  will increase output of crude,
natural gas liquids, and non-conventional oils by 2.2 million
barrels a day to 53.3 million a day by 2014, limiting the need
for extra supplies from OPEC. The growth is driven by Canadian
oil sands projects and Brazilian biofuels.  Natural gas liquids, or NGLs, are excluded from OPEC’s
production figures and the quota system that applies to 11 of
OPEC’s 12 members. OPEC’s output of NGLs will grow by 1.5
million barrels a day to 6.2 million a day in 2015, from 4.7
million this year, according to the report.  Spare Capacity  The organization cut its 2014 forecast for consumption of
its own crude to 30.6 million barrels a day. That means it will
still need to increase  crude production  by 1.3 million barrels a
day in four years’ time from 29.3 million a day this year.  OPEC’s current spare production  capacity  would allow it to
provide nearly four times that amount. Idle capacity was at 5.8
million barrels a day last month, down from a seven-year high of
6.8 million in March 2009, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  China’s demand  for crude will increase 21 percent to 10.5
million barrels a day in 2014, and then to 10.9 million a day in
2015, from 8.7 million a day this year, according to the report.
Global consumption will reach 91 million barrels a day in 2015,
it said.  “All of the oil demand increase over the medium-term is
from developing countries, and over two-thirds of this growth
will come from developing Asia, with China seeing the largest
expansion,” OPEC said.  $2.3 Trillion Spend  By 2030, worldwide oil demand will grow 24 percent to 105.5
million barrels a day, an assessment “essentially unchanged”
from last year’s, OPEC said. The group expects it will need to
provide 38.7 million barrels of crude a day at this time, or 2.4
million a day less than it anticipated in last year’s report.
The global oil industry will need to spend $2.3 trillion by 2030
to develop new supplies, according to OPEC.  The  International Energy Agency  releases its own long-term
assessment, the World Energy Outlook, on Nov. 9.  Crude futures on the New York Mercantile exchange for
delivery this December rose to a six-month high of $86.05 a
barrel today. OPEC said it assumes that prices will remain in a
range of $75 to $85 until 2020, and then increase to $106 a
barrel by 2030.  OPEC’s 12 members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It is next scheduled to meet in Quito,
Ecuador, on Dec. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
