Centro Properties Group , the
Australian shopping-mall owner that ceded control to creditors
in 2008, said a number of parties have approached it with
expressions of interest in its businesses and assets.  Centro will start to evaluate these expressions of interest,
the company said in a statement to the stock exchange today. The
company is seeking buyers for more than A$4 billion ($4 billion)
of assets, said a person with knowledge of the matter last week.  “The significant interest in Centro’s businesses over
recent months has been encouraging,” Centro Chairman,  Paul Cooper , said in the statement today.  Centro has set a Dec. 25 deadline for indicative bids for
more than 40 properties, including the  Galleria  in Perth and  The
Glen  in Melbourne, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the plans aren’t public. Prospective buyers
will be given access to financial information on the assets in
the next few weeks, the person said last week.  Centro, which manages an A$18.6 billion collection of 712
shopping centers in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., said in
July it was in talks with lenders about debt due next year. The
company had A$18.4 billion of debt as of June 30, company
filings show, as the value of its properties fell and debt costs
soared following a A$9 billion buying spree in 2006 and 2007.  Australia’s 16 listed property trusts reported combined
losses of A$19.5 billion and writedowns of A$21.7 billion in the
year to June 30, 2009, after their strategy of borrowing to fund
overseas investments backfired when property values tumbled and
borrowing costs spiked during the credit crunch.  Centro shares added 3.1 percent to 16.5 Australian cents at
12:30 p.m. in Sydney. The stock has  lost  more than A$6 billion
in market value in the past three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
