Copper rose to the highest price in
28 months as the dollar tumbled after the Federal Reserve
pledged more stimulus money to bolster the U.S. economy.  The Fed, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, said yesterday it
will purchase an additional $600 billion of Treasuries through
June, debasing the U.S. currency. The  greenback  slumped to an
11-month low against a basket of six major currencies. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials extended
a rally to the highest level since October 2008.  “Bernanke has decided to attack the value of U.S.
dollar,” said Michael Pento, a senior economist at Euro Pacific
Capital in New York. “The other central bankers are trying to
drain liquidity. That’s going to send the dollar down much lower
and prices of every commodity much higher.”  Copper for December delivery advanced 12.5 cents, or 3.3
percent, to $3.91 a pound at 11:01 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $3.914, the highest level for a
most-active contract since July 3, 2008.  Copper will probably rise above $4 by the end of the second
quarter as the U.S. Dollar Index drops below 70 from the current
level of 75.738, Pento said. Copper rose to a record $4.2605 in
May 2008. Before today, the six-currency gauge of the
greenback’s strength declined 9.7 percent since July 1, while
copper jumped 32 percent.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $264, or 3.2 percent, to $8,584 a metric ton ($3.89
a pound). Tin, lead, nickel, aluminum and zinc also gained on
the LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
