Sundance Resources Ltd. , seeking to
develop a $3.4 billion iron ore mine in West Africa, hired  Citic
Securities Co.  to help it get debt and equity funding for the
project.  Citic, China’s largest brokerage, will hold talks with
several groups interested in investing in the Mbalam mine,
Perth-based Sundance said today in a statement.  Hiring Citic “will help with the vast array of potential
funding options available to the Mbalam project in China,” the
company said.  China, the world’s largest buyer of iron ore, increased
demand to a record last year to produce steel for homes, cars
and appliances. The nation’s companies are expanding investments
in steelmaking raw materials globally, with Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. agreeing in July to pay $1.35 billion for a stake in
Rio Tinto Group’s Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.  Sundance  shares  have more than doubled in the past 12
months. They closed unchanged at 31 cents today, while the
 S&P/ASX 200 Materials Index  rose 3.4 percent.  Sundance, whose board members were killed in a plane crash
in the Republic of Congo in June, aims to complete an initial
study for the project in Cameroon and Congo by the end of the
first quarter of 2011, it said in an Oct. 27 regulatory filing.  The company has signed agreements with units of China
Railway Construction Corp. and China Communications Construction
Co. Ltd. to help develop the rail and port for the project, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
