Aldar Properties PJSC  declined to the
lowest in two months on speculation Abu Dhabi’s biggest property
developer may face funding difficulties after the chief
executive officer resigned.  The shares retreated 4.2 percent to 2.30 dirhams at 2 p.m.
in Abu Dhabi, the lowest close since Sept. 2. The shares, down
for a fourth day, have slumped 54 percent this year.  Chief Executive Officer John Bullough left the company,
Aldar said on Nov. 1. His replacement will be named after a
board meeting on Nov. 8. The developer has about 26 billion
dirhams ($7 billion) of  debt outstanding , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is taking the resignation of the CEO as a
negative sign that Aldar’s funding plan won’t materialize” this
year, said  Majed Azzam , a real-estate analyst at Alembic HC
Securities. “We believe that the market is overreacting to
unsubstantiated rumors. The company still maintains that it is
on track to announce a funding strategy toward year-end which
should alleviate concerns.” Azzam has an  “overweight ”
recommendation on the shares.  Aldar is due to announce third-quarter results next week.
The median estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is
for a fourth consecutive quarterly loss of 215 million dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
