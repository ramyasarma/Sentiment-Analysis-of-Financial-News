France’s secret service  doesn’t act
like its Cold War or Soviet-era counterparts, Interior Minister
Brice Hortefeux said, dismissing allegations that the agency has
spied on journalists reporting on a political scandal.  “There are no political police in our country,” Hortefeux
told  France 2  television in Paris today. “This is a joke.”
France’s secret service, known as the DCRI, “is not the Stasi
or the KGB,” he said, referring to the former East German and
Soviet spy agencies. DCRI’s job “isn’t to go after journalists,
but after terrorists.”  National daily Le Monde filed a complaint in September
saying the French intelligence service taped one of its
reporters who is investigating a matter involving President
Nicolas Sarkozy,  L’Oreal SA  heiress Liliane Bettencourt and
Labor Minister Eric Woerth. Computers and CDs have been reported
 stolen  from three media --  Le Point  weekly, Mediapart website
and Le Monde -- since October.  Investigative weekly  Le Canard Enchaine  reported yesterday
that Sarkozy had asked the DCRI to spy on reporters. Government
spokesman Luc Chatel called the report “totally crazy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
