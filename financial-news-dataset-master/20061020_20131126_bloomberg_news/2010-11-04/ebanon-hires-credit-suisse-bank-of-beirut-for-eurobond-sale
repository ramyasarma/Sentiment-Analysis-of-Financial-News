Lebanon hired Credit Suisse Group AG
and Bank of Beirut SAL to help sell $700 million of Eurobonds to
refinance debt maturing this month, the Lebanese lender said on
its  website.   The government plans to sell $500 million of bonds maturing
in eight years, with yields in the range of 5.15 percent to 5.25
percent, and $200 million maturing in 12 years with a yield
range of 6.1 percent to 6.2 percent, the bank said.  Lebanese Finance Minister  Raya Haffar el-Hassan  said in an
August interview that the country may sell Eurobonds or swap as
much as $4.8 billion of debt maturing this year and next, as it
looks to benefit from low global interest rates before central
banks worldwide begin to tighten monetary policy.  Lebanon has about $893 million of Eurobonds maturing this
month and in December, and $2.14 billion due next year. When
interest payments are included, the total redemption would be
$1.5 billion this year and $3.3 billion in 2011.  The country has already sold $1.2 billion of 10-year
Eurobonds this year with an interest rate of 6.375 percent, to
refinance debt that matured in March.  Prime Minister  Saad Hariri’s  national unity coalition,
formed a year ago, has to finance public debt that the
government expects to rise to $55.3 billion next year, or about
129 percent of gross domestic product.  Lebanon’s debt-to-GDP ratio has declined from a high of 180
percent at the end of 2006. It accumulated the debt to rebuild
the country after a  15-year civil war  that ended in 1990 and the
conflict with Israel in 2006.  ‘Continuing Borrowing Needs’  “Issuing new Eurobonds or rolling over maturing ones,
instead of paying off the maturing bonds and retiring part of
the public debt reflects the continuing borrowing needs of the
government as a result of delays in implementing structural
reforms,” said  Nassib Ghobril , head of research at  Byblos Bank
SAL  in Beirut.  Plans to sell two state-owned mobile-phone operators, which
aimed to raise as much as $7 billion, were put on hold first
because of internal political tensions and then due to the
global credit crunch and parliamentary elections last year.
Restructuring the state-owned power company,  Electricite du
Liban , which received $1.5 billion of government subsidies last
year, has also been delayed.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Lebanon’s domestic and
foreign-currency bonds at B1, four levels below investment
grade. Standard & Poor’s rates Lebanon at B, five levels below
investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
