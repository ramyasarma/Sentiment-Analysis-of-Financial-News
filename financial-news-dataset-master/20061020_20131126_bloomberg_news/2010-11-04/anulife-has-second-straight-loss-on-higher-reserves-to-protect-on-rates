Manulife Financial Corp. , the worst-
performing financial stock in Canada this year, recorded its
second straight quarterly loss as the company boosted reserves
to protect against falling interest rates. The stock had its
biggest gain in five months.  The third-quarter net loss widened to C$947 million ($945
million), or 55 cents a share, from C$172 million, or 12 cents a
year ago, Canada’s largest insurer said today in a statement.  Manulife recorded C$2.03 billion in costs to reflect
falling interest rates and a C$1.04 billion writedown on its
U.S. insurance business. That offset C$1.04 billion in gains
from an equity rally.  “The market has viewed Manulife’s results as a bit of a
relief,” said  John Aiken , an analyst at Barclays Capital in
Toronto. “The earnings address many concerns surrounding its
current condition as it has now successfully moved past its
actuarial liability review and has re-strengthened its capital
ratio.”  Before one-time items, Manulife had profit of C$779
million, within the company’s estimate of C$700 million to C$800
million per quarter. Toronto-based Manulife was expected to have
a loss before items of 77 cents a share, the average  estimate  of
10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Manulife climbed 80 cents, or 6.2 percent, to C$13.70 at
9:52 a.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest gain since May 27.  Canadian Profit  The U.S. insurance unit recorded profit of C$206 million,
compared with a year-earlier loss of C$601 million, on equity
gains. U.S. asset-management profit fell 43 percent to C$340
million. Manulife owns Boston-based John Hancock Financial.  Profit from the insurer’s Canadian unit more than tripled
to C$358 million as funds under management increased, while its
Asia and Japan unit profit climbed 36 percent to C$567 million.  Manulife is the third of Canada’s four main life insurers
to report results this week. Industrial Alliance Insurance and
Financial Services Inc. said profit climbed 8.8 percent to
C$65.4 million, or 78 cents a share, while Sun Life Financial
Inc. had net income of C$453 million, or 79 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss.  Great-West Lifeco Inc., Canada’s second-biggest insurer, is
scheduled to release results Nov. 10.  (Manulife will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. Toronto time. To
