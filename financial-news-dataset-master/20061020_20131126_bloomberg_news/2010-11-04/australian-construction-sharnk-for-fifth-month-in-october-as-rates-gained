Australia’s  building industry 
contracted in October for a fifth straight month, a sign the
central bank’s interest-rate increases are restricting demand
for new dwellings.  The construction performance index was 44 last month, an
increase from 40.8 in September, according to a survey by the
Australian Industry Group and Housing Industry Association
released in Sydney today. A reading below 50 indicates the
industry is shrinking.  The Reserve Bank of Australia resumed raising interest
rates this week, ending a five-month pause in the overnight cash
rate target with a quarter percentage-point increase to 4.75
percent. While today’s report showed the index’s first rise
since April, any rebound may be temporary because of higher
borrowing costs.  “The interest-rate environment, in terms of both action
and speculation, is proving highly damaging to homebuilding
confidence and activity at a time when there is already
compelling evidence that 2011 will be a weaker year for
residential construction,”  Harley Dale , the Housing Industry
Association’s chief economist, said in a statement.  A gauge of engineering work rose 0.1 point to 37.5 in
October and commercial work climbed 10.9 points to 46.4, today’s
report showed. House building advanced 15.5 points to 47.9. The
measure of new orders gained 4.1 points to 42.4, the report
showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
