The economies of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, which suffered the European Union’s deepest recession
last year, must cut wages and prices to improve competitiveness,
 Capital Economics  said.  Lithuania’s recent revision of second-quarter growth and
slower expansion in the third quarter “highlights the limited
extent of the recovery seen in the country so far,” the London-
based Capital Economics said in an e-mailed note today.
“Lithuania’s recovery is definitely L-shaped.”  The Baltic economies, which returned to growth in the
second quarter, have been relying on exports to return to
growth. The real effective exchange rates, which show the price
development of Baltic goods versus those of major trading
partners, must fall by another 5 to 10 percent to regain
competitiveness, Capital said.  The Baltic region’s economic growth may accelerate to 3
percent next year before slowing to a 2 percent rate in 2012,
Capital Economics said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
