London’s 100 Club, which featured
early performances by bands such the Jimi Hendrix Experience,
the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols, the Who and Oasis, is to
close by Christmas if it can’t find a corporate partner, the
London-based Times reported, citing owner Jeff Horton.  The club, named after its address in the West End’s Oxford
Street, is a scruffy small room which started life as a club 70
years ago for U.S. soldiers wanting to hear swing music they
could jitterbug to - the energetic dance form was banned in many
other London venues, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
