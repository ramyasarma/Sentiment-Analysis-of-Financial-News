Clearwire Corp. , the company building
out a high-speed WiMax wireless network, will cut 15 percent of
its workforce and suspend expansion of its own stores to
conserve cash as it searches for a new source of funds.  Clearwire is also reducing sales and marketing spending and
delaying its Clear-branded smartphone as part of a plan to save
between $100 million and $200 million this year, according to a
statement today. The Kirkland, Washington-based  company  has
4,200 employees, putting the cuts at about 630 jobs.  The plan should save $100 million to $200 million more in
2011’s first half of 2011, the company said. Clearwire got
$1.56 billion from  Sprint Nextel Corp.  and other investors last
year to help it expand its high-speed mobile Internet network to
cover 120 million people. Clearwire said it expects to have more
than 4 million customers by the end of the year, an increase
from 2.84 million at the end of the third quarter.  The  company  will consider selling debt, equity or assets,
including a portion of its spectrum that isn’t crucial to the
business, Chief Executive Officer  Bill Morrow  said on a
conference call. Clearwire isn’t disclosing how much money it
will need, said  Mike DiGioia , a spokesman.  Clearwire  rose  14 cents, or 2 percent, to $7.17 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading at 4 p.m. New York time. The stock has
gained 6.1 percent this year.  $4 Billion  The company may need to raise $1 billion next year and a
total of $4 billion by 2014, according to  Michael Nelson , an
 analyst  at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York who rates the
shares a “buy.” That amount would let the company reach
270 million people with its network by 2018, he said.  The third-quarter  net loss  widened to $139.4 million, or
58 cents a share, from $82.4 million, or 43 cents, a year
earlier, while  revenue  more than doubled to $147 million, the
company said. Analysts had estimated $158.3 million in revenue,
the average of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg  survey .  Clearwire reshaped itself into a WiMax company in 2008 with
a $3.2 billion investment from Overland Park, Kansas-based
Sprint, along with Intel Corp., Google Inc., Comcast Corp., Time
Warner Cable Inc. and Brighthouse Networks. Sprint also donated
its own WiMax network assets and owns more than half of
Clearwire.  Some of the partners, including Sprint, sell the wireless
service under their own brand names. This year, Sprint
introduced a smartphone, the Evo, that uses the high-speed
technology.  (Clearwire held a conference call at 4:30 p.m. New York
