HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement and concrete, rose the most in
almost six months in Frankfurt trading as third-quarter  profit 
more than doubled, beating estimates.  HeidelbergCement  gained  as much as 8.6 percent to 40.82
euros in the biggest intraday jump  since  May 10, and was up
6.6 percent as of 10:09 a.m. Net income rose to 322 million
euros ($458 million) from 149 million euros a year earlier,
while sales increased 13 percent to 3.4 billion euros the
company said today in a  statement .  Sales volumes for cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed
concrete all rose in the quarter as economies around the world
recovered faster than expected. The Heidelberg, Germany-based
company said cost-reduction efforts, including job cuts in North
America and the U.K., are poised to deliver 300 million euros in
savings this year, with 203 million euros secured in the first
nine months.  “We see the investment case supported by these results,”
as earnings were also helped by rising prices and currency
shifts,  Ralf Doerper , an analyst at WestLB in Dusseldorf,
Germany, with an “add”  recommendation  on HeidelbergCement
stock, said today in a research report.  Profit beat the 273 million-euro average  estimate  of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, while sales exceeded their
outlook for 3.34 billion euros.  Economic Growth  The cement maker  expects  to benefit to an “above-average
degree” from an economic recovery this year and the next, Chief
Executive Officer  Bernd Scheifele  said in the statement, without
providing details.  Cemex SAB, the largest cement maker in the Americas, posted
a loss on Oct. 26 as cement prices fell in the U.S. and Spain’s
construction industry contracted.  Lafarge SA , the world’s
largest cement maker, reports earnings tomorrow.  HeidelbergCement added to  borrowings  with its $12 billion
takeover of British rival Hanson Plc in 2007. Net debt was
reduced by 3.6 percent to 8.65 billion euros as of Sept. 30, the
German company said today.  The  stock’s  gain today pared the decline this year to
17 percent, giving HeidelbergCement a market value of 7.52
billion euros. Lafarge has  dropped  23 percent in Paris trading
in 2010, while Cemex has  declined  25 percent in Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
