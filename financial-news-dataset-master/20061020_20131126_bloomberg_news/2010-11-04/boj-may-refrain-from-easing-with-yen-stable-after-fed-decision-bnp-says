The Bank of Japan may refrain from
introducing new measures to ease monetary policy at the end of a
two-day meeting tomorrow after the Federal Reserve’s asset-
purchase plan didn’t fuel gains in the yen, BNP Paribas said.  The Fed said yesterday it will buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries through June to help cap U.S. borrowing
costs, reducing the attractiveness of assets in the world’s
largest economy. The size of the Fed’s purchases was almost in
line with market expectations, said  Tomohisa Fujiki , an
interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas Securities Japan Ltd.  “Japan’s currency is in a better situation than before”
the Fed’s announcement, Tokyo-based Fujiki said. “If the Fed’s
decision led the yen to gain, then the Bank of Japan would be
forced to ease policy further. If the yen stays at current
levels, there’s little likelihood the central bank will expand
its asset-purchase fund.”  The yen traded at 80.83 per dollar as of 3:14 p.m. in Tokyo
compared with its close of 80.63 on Nov. 2, the day before the
Fed’s announcement. Japan’s currency advanced to 80.22 on Nov. 1,
the strongest since April 1995.  As the yen failed to strengthen, the Bank of Japan is now
likely to just announce the details of its purchases of real-
estate investment trusts and exchange-traded funds, Fujiki said.  The purchases will be part of a 5 trillion-yen ($62
billion) fund unveiled by Japanese policy makers last month. The
central bank brought forward its November meeting date by more
than a week to speed up the purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
