Mexico’s peso rose for a sixth day,
the longest winning streak since September, as the Federal
Reserve’s plan to purchase $600 billion of securities fueled
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 12.2239 per dollar at 9:43
a.m. New York time, from 12.2462 yesterday. The currency has
gained 7 percent this year. The peso earlier today touched
12.2063, the strongest since May 3. The streak of gains is the
longest since the seven-day period ending Sept. 16.  “The peso is being dominated by the monetary stimulus,”
said  Rafael Camarena , an economist with Banco Santander SA in
Mexico City. “Foreign investors are buying up every security
denominated in pesos they can right now.”  The Fed said yesterday it will purchase an extra $600
billion of Treasuries through June as part of its record
stimulus and “will adjust the program as needed to foster
maximum employment and price stability.” The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell 5
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.36 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.60 centavo to 133.81 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
