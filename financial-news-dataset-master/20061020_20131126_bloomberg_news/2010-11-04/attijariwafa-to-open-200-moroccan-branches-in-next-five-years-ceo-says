Attijariwafa Bank , Morocco’s largest
publicly traded bank, plans to open more than 200 branches in
the country in the next five years, Chief Executive Officer
 Mohamed El Kettani  said.  “We want to maintain our leadership and expand throughout
the kingdom, even in the most remote parts, to get closer to our
customers,” El Kettani said yesterday in an interview at his
office in Casablanca.  The bank, part of the Moroccan royal family’s  Omnium Nord
Africain  holding company, has the biggest banking network in the
country with over 1,400 branches and 4.3 million customers,
according to Attijariwafa.  Attijariwafa operates in 22 countries in Europe and Africa,
including branches in Congo, Senegal, Gabon and Mali. This year
the company acquired 60 percent of the Mauritanian branch of
French bank BNP Paribas SA and is planning further expansion in
Africa, said El Kettani.  First-half profit advanced to 2.3 billion Moroccan dirhams
($290 million), a 17 percent rise from a year earlier, the bank
said Sept. 28.  Shares of Attijariwafa rose 0.5 percent to 340 dirhams at
2:03 p.m. in Casablanca today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
