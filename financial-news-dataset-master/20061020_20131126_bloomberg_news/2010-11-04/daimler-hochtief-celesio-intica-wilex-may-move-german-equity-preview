German stocks rallied, sending the
DAX Index to its highest level in more than two years, after the

more than doubled in the third quarter.  Metro AG  rose 3.7
percent after the company said it will open more stores in

percent today.  “We see equity markets reacting positively to the Fed
announcement as they are getting further support,” said  Raimund Saxinger , a fund manager at Frankfurt Trust Investment GmbH,
which oversees about $22 billion. “There is still a bit of
upside left towards the end of the year and the rally could
continue into next year. My year-end target for the DAX and
EuroStoxx are still a bit higher compared to current levels.”  U.S. stocks climbed yesterday after the Fed said new
purchases will be about $75 billion a month through June and it
will “adjust the program as needed.” Most economists surveyed
by Bloomberg predicted policy makers would add at least $500
billion to the financial system. Asian stocks extended the
global rally as the central bank also left unchanged its pledge

managers in both industries slipped to 53.8 from 54.1 in the
previous month, London-based Markit Economics said today. It had
initially reported a drop to 53.4. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. A services gauge for the euro region fell to 53.3

and concrete, jumped 8.9 percent to 40.95 euros. Net income rose

world’s most populous country.  Metro aims to win a 10 percent share of China’s consumer-
electronics market, which is forecast to double to 180 billion
euros ($256 billion) in a decade.  Thyssenkrupp AG and  Salzgitter AG  increased 1.7 percent to

interest and taxes to above 10 percent of sales for this year,
from an earlier prediction of more than 11 percent.  Adidas  Adidas AG  slid 3.3 percent to 46.50 euros, the first
