Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. ,
owner of the Food Network and HGTV, rose 3.9 percent in New York
trading after third-quarter  profit  topped analysts’ estimates.  Scripps Networks  climbed  $1.97 to $52.47 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the  biggest  increase
since Sept. 1. The shares reached the  highest price  since the
company split from its newspaper assets in June 2008.  Increases in advertising sales and subscriber fees at the
cable networks “will lead the industry,” UBS AG analyst  John Janedis  wrote in a report today. At the networks -- ranging from
Cooking Channel to DIY Network -- affiliate fees paid by cable
operators climbed 39 percent and ad revenue was up 18 percent.
That excludes results for Travel Channel, which wasn’t owned in
the year-ago period.  Excluding a tax adjustment and costs related to changes at
the Travel Channel, profit of 59 cents beat the 52-cent average
of 16 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income  rose to $101.7 million, or 61 cents a share,
from $65.3 million, or 39 cents, a year ago, the Cincinnati-
based company said today in a statement. Revenue rose 40 percent
to $508.7 million, compared with the $486.3 million average
analyst projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
