U.S. corn production this year will
be less than forecast by the government, while soybean output
will exceed the estimate, the Linn Group said today in an e-
mailed report. The corn harvest will be 12.521 billion bushels,
less than the 12.664 billion forecast by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture last month, the research and brokerage firm said.
The soybean crop will total 3.483 billion bushels, more than the
USDA forecast of 3.408 billion, the Linn Group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
