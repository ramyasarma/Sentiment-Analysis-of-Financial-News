What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange as the dollar’s slump enhances
the appeal of U.S. exports, said  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. Adverse U.S.
weather also threatens prospects for the winter crop, he said.  -- Corn futures are called 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT after the Federal Reserve’s latest stimulus plan drove
the greenback lower and boosted commodities, Roose said.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 18 cents higher on the
dollar’s slide, Roose said. Soybean meal futures may open $2 to
$3 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to open
up 0.7 cent to 0.9 cent a pound.  To contact the reporters on this story:
