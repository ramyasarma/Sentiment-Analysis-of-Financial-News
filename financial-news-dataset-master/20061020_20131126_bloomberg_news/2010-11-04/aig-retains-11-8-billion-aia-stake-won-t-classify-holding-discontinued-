American International Group Inc.,
the bailed-out insurer, said the value of its remaining stake in
AIA Group Ltd. was $11.8 billion as of Oct. 29, after selling a
67 percent stake in the Hong Kong-based firm.  AIG won’t count AIA as a “discontinued operation” when
the company reports third-quarter results, the New York-based
insurer said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
