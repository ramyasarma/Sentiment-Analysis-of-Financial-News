E-CL SA , the Chilean power generator
controlled by France’s GDF Suez, rose on a report that the local
Luksic family may be interested in buying a 40 percent stake in
the company.  E-CL gained 1.5 percent to 1,320 pesos at 11:37 a.m. New
York time, the largest intraday increase in almost a week. The
IPSA index rose 0.4 percent to 4,994.34.  Guillermo Luksic , chairman of holding company  Quinenco SA ,
said at an event yesterday that the family would be interested
in buying the stake in E-CL if Codelco, Chile’s state-owned
copper company, decides to sell it, newspaper La Tercera
reported.  Codelco said Sept. 15 that it hired Banco Santander SA as
lead adviser for the possible sale of its stake in E-CL.
Proceeds would go toward planned expansions, Codelco Chief
Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said June 2 in an interview.  Calls to Quinenco’s press office seeking comment weren’t
immediately responded.  Quinenco rose 0.9 percent to 1660.10 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
