BAA Ltd. , the owner of London’s
Heathrow airport, is backing the construction of a second high-
speed rail line in the U.K., saying it will improve Heathrow’s
ability to compete against rival hubs in continental Europe.  U.K. Transport Secretary  Philip Hammond  last month proposed
building a Y-shaped high-speed rail network connecting the West
Midlands to Manchester and Leeds in the north of England. The
proposal was initiated by Hammond’s predecessor, Andrew Adonis.  “High-speed rail is a win for everyone, provided it offers
frequent connections and great passenger experience,” BAA Chief
Executive Officer  Colin Matthews  will say in a speech today at a
U.K. High Speed Rail Conference in London, according to an e-
mailed BAA statement. “It’s also vital that high-speed rail is
fast enough to tempt passengers away from flying short-haul to
Europe and continuing from there.”  Heathrow, Europe’s biggest airport, competes with other
hubs such as Paris’s Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam’s Schipol
for international traffic. BAA is owned by Spanish construction
company  Ferrovial SA .  The U.K. government is close to completing the sale of the
rights to operate the country’s first high-speed line, which
connects the Channel Tunnel with St. Pancras International
station in central London.  Groupe Eurotunnel SA , the owner and
operator of the Channel Tunnel, as part of the GB Speedrail
partnership, is among companies that have submitted a bid to run
the line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
