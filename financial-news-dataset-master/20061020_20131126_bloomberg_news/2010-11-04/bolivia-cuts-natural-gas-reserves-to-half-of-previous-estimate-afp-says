YPF Bolivianos, Bolivia’s state-owned
energy company, said the country’s proven natural-gas reserves
are about half of the previous estimate, Agence France-Presse
reported.  The proven reserves total 360 billion cubic meters, down
from a previous estimate from 2005 of 700 billion cubic meters,
AFP said, citing YPF Bolivianos President Carlos Villegas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
