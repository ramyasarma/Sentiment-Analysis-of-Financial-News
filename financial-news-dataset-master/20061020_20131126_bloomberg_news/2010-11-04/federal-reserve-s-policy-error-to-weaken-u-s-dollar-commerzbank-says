The Federal Reserve’s decision to
leave its extended asset-purchase plan open-ended and based on
price stability and employment is a “policy error” that will
keep the dollar under pressure, Commerzbank AG said.  The so-called quantitative easing plan “might become a
bottomless pit,”  Lutz Karpowitz  and  Ulrich Leuchtmann , foreign-
exchange strategists in Frankfurt, wrote today in a note to
clients. “It is far from certain that its purchases of
Treasury-notes will ignite a quicker recovery.”  The analysts said investors should consider buying the
Australian dollar against the U.S. currency to “play U.S.
dollar weakness.”  The so-called Aussie dollar was little changed at $1.0054
as of 6:45 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
