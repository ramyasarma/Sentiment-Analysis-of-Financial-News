Heraymila Investments Ltd. , which
manages Saudi Arabian entrepreneur Abdulaziz Al Mashal ’s
businesses, including private equity and real estate, will start
a fund in Sri Lanka to benefit from the island’s growth.  Heraymila, based in Dubai, plans to raise at least 5
billion rupees ($45 million) for the fund that will invest in
listed Sri Lankan companies. Faster economic  growth  with the end
of Sri Lanka’s 26-year civil war in May 2009 is boosting company
earnings and encouraging investments.  The fund, structured as a unit trust, will start raising
money from investors in the Middle East and Asia by the middle
of 2011, Ravi Abeysuriya, chief executive officer of Heraymila’s
stock broking unit in Sri Lanka, said in Colombo today.
Heraymila, which manages $260 million in assets, will also set
up a unit in Sri Lanka to channel private equity investment to
the island, Abeysuriya said.  “The end of the civil war could add 2 percent to Sri
Lanka’s growth each year,” said Shamubeel Eaqub, consultant
economist for Heraymila Securities Ltd. “There are
opportunities to invest in banks and construction firms. The
consumer sector is a good long-term play given Sri Lanka’s
burgeoning middle-class.”  The Colombo  All-Share Index  has doubled this year, making
it the second-best performing index in the world behind the
Mongolia Stock Exchange’s Top 20 index among benchmarks tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
