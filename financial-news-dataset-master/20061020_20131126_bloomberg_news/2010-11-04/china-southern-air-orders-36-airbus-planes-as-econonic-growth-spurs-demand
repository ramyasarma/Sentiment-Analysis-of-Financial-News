China Southern Airlines Co., the
nation’s largest carrier, said it ordered 36 Airbus SAS planes
as economic growth stokes travel demand.  The carrier will acquire six widebody A330 planes and 30
single-aisle A320-series aircraft, it said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange statement today. The planes have a total list price of
$3.8 billion, according to the statement. Planemakers usually
grant discounts to large customers.  China Southern’s passenger numbers jumped 18 percent from a
year earlier in the quarter ended September as rising wages and
investment spurs business and leisure traffic. China will likely
be the second-largest plane market after the U.S. over the next
20 years as carriers add aircraft to keep pace with demand,
according to Boeing Co.  Airbus may secure a contract from China for at least 100
aircraft as early as today, as Chinese President Hu Jintao
visits France, four people familiar with the talks said earlier
this week. The planemaker has opened an A320 assembly plant in
China, its first outside Europe, to help win orders in the
world’s most populous nation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
