A  Zimbabwean  man was killed by a
pride of lions while he was bathing under a tree at a campsite
in the southern African country, the  Herald  reported, citing
Clemence Mabgweazara, a police inspector.  Peter John Evershed, 59, went to wash himself “a few
meters” away from the campsite in Makuti when he was surrounded
by the lions and attacked, the Harare-based newspaper said
today. Evershed screamed for help and other tourists tried to
scare the animals away by driving to the scene and flashing
their lights, it said.  The lions were scared off when a safari operator fired a
shot into the air, the Herald said. Evershed died by the time
the animals fled after he sustained a gash to his throat, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
