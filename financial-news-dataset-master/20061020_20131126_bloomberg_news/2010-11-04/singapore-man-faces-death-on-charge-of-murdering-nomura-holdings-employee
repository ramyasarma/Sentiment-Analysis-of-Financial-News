A Singapore man was charged with the
murder of a  Nomura Holdings Inc.  employee who died from injuries
sustained in the city state last month.  Ang Hoe Meng Jack, 41, is accused of killing  Takanori Inada , 30, in an alley in Singapore’s Chinatown, according to a
police document. Ang is scheduled to next appear in a Singapore
court Nov. 11 and will remain in custody as the investigation
continues, the court heard today.  Inada was found lying on the ground with multiple bruises
and pronounced dead in hospital on Oct. 23, Singapore police
said. Ang faces the death penalty if convicted, police said.  Eiji Miura , Nomura’s Tokyo-based spokesman, said Inada, who
was from Japan, was studying in Singapore.  “We extremely regret losing an employee of great
promise,” Miura said in an e-mailed statement. “We are
watching how the local investigation will progress.”  Ang, a housing broker with  PropNex , will have his contract
terminated, according to Adam Tan, a spokesman for Singapore’s
second-biggest property services firm by number of agents.  “We haven’t had access to him yet,” Ang’s lawyer Zaminder
Gill told reporters today. Ang, who hasn’t been allowed bail and
didn’t enter a plea, may be brought to the crime scene as part
of the investigations, Gill said.  The case is Public Prosecutor v. Ang Hoe Meng Jack,
Singapore Subordinate Court, PIC 232/2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
