Asian  stocks  rose, propelling a
benchmark index to the highest level in more than two years,
after the U.S. Federal Reserve expanded measures to boost the
world’s largest economy. India’s Sensitive Index climbed to its
highest close on record.  Canon Inc. , which gets 27 percent of its sales in the
Americas, jumped 2.9 percent in Tokyo. Hynix Semiconductor Inc.
advanced 5.3 percent in Seoul on speculation chip prices will
rise.  BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company,
surged 2.6 percent in Sydney after Canadian regulators blocked
its acquisition of Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  Coal India
Ltd.  surged 34 percent in its trading debut following the
nation’s largest initial share sale.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 1.7 percent to 133.08 as
of 8:32 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest level since July 24, 2008.
About seven stocks advanced for every two that fell after the
Fed said yesterday it will buy an additional $600 billion of
Treasuries through June to bolster economic growth.  “The move to inject more money into the system is a
massively important thing for markets,” said  James Holt , who
helps manage about $40 billion at BlackRock Investment
Management (Australia) Ltd. “Every asset class gets a kick
along. The recovery looks like it’s happening, but the
overwhelming evidence is that it’s a weaker-than-expected
recovery.”  India’s  Sensitive Index  rose 2.1 percent to 20,893.57,
still below its intraday record of 21,206.77 reached on Jan. 10,
2008. China’s Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.9 percent. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 2.2 percent in Japan, where
markets resumed trading after a holiday yesterday.  Fed Purchases  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.6 percent as Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying developers. Australia’s 
S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 0.5 percent. Qantas Airways Ltd., the
country’s largest airline, tumbled as much as 1.7 percent after
engine failure forced one of its jets to return to Singapore.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained 0.6
percent. The index gained 0.4 percent to a six-month high
yesterday as the Fed’s announcement drove banks higher. Bank of
Japan policy makers convene today and tomorrow, following the
Fed’s two-day meeting that ended yesterday.  Canon, the world’s largest camera maker, rose 2.9 percent
to 3,780 yen in Tokyo. Electronics maker Sony Corp., which
derives more than 20 percent of its sales in the U.S., climbed
0.5 percent to 2,641 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s
biggest automaker, gained 2.3 percent to 2,910 yen.  U.S. Sales  “People perceive that the Fed’s decision will support
valuations of risk assets,” said  Tim Leung , who helps manage
about $1.5 billion at IG Investment Ltd. in Hong Kong. Asian
exporters may benefit “if this kind of policy has a marginal
effect in encouraging more spending by U.S. consumers,” he said.  In Hong Kong,  HSBC Holdings Plc  gained 3.6 percent to
HK$85.50. The bank, Europe’s largest, counts North America as
its second-biggest market. Techtronic Industries Co., maker of
Hoover vacuum cleaners and Ryobi power tools, jumped 7.3 percent
to HK$8.70. The company got 73 percent of its first-half sales
in North America.  Finance and technology companies accounted for 38 percent
of the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s advance today.  Hynix, the world’s second-largest computer-memory chipmaker,
advanced 5.3 percent to 22,950 won in Seoul after the Nikkei
newspaper reported that rival Elpida Memory Inc. plans to cut
production.  Elpida  rallied 5.1 percent to 803 yen in Tokyo.  “We’re seeing growing signs that industry bottom is near,
with rivals likely to cut production or investments amid
deteriorating cash flow, and that’s boosting Hynix shares,”
said  Kim Young Chan , an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.  Hostile Bid  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  increased 8.7 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 7.4 percent by the S&P 500
and 5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated profit, more than
14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  BHP Billiton  surged 2.6 percent to A$43.72 in Sydney.
Canada blocked its $40 billion hostile bid for Potash Corp.,
saying a sale of the world’s largest fertilizer company wouldn’t
provide a “net benefit” to the country.  “The market saw the long-term benefits of this deal, but
its failure creates opportunities for BHP’s surplus cash,” said
BlackRock’s Holt.  Coal India, the world’s No. 1 producer of the fuel, surged
40 percent to 342.55 rupees after selling 152 billion rupees
($3.4 billion) of shares at the top of a price range offered to
investors.  ‘Chasing Growth’  The Sensitive Index, or Sensex, has surged 30 percent since
May 25 and is the best performer this year among the world’s 10
biggest stock markets. Foreign fund inflows have surged 80
percent, helping to absorb Coal India’s share sale and making
the Sensex the most expensive benchmark index in Asia.  “Money is chasing growth,” said  Sankaran Naren , chief
equities investment officer at ICICI Prudential Asset Management
Co., which manages $15.8 billion.  In Hong Kong,  Sino Land Co. , among Goldman Sachs’ top picks,
surged 6.1 percent to HK$18.10 in Hong Kong. New World
Development Co. climbed 4.7 percent to HK$16.98. Goldman Sachs
forecast “another round of strong property sales to boost
developers’ performance,” a report today said.  Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.  rose 1.1
percent to 371 yen. The Japanese bank is negotiating with Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and the U.K. government to buy
project-finance assets valued at about 4 billion pounds ($6.4
billion), two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Engine Failure  Fast Retailing Co., Asia’s biggest clothing chain operator,
jumped 8.1 percent to 11,700 yen for the  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index ’s second-biggest advance. The company’s Uniqlo chain
posted its smallest domestic sales decline in three months.  Sydney-based Qantas gained 0.7 percent to A$2.89, rallying
from its earlier  slump , after the Airbus SAS A380 jet landed
safely in Singapore. The plane took off from the city-state and
an explosion occurred while it was flying over Indonesia’s Batam
island, Bambang Ervan, a spokesman at the Indonesian transport
ministry, said. Some news reports earlier said that the plane
had crashed.  “It’s never good to see these sorts of situations develop
and it highlights the risk of holding one of the airline
stocks,” said  Chris Weston , an institutional dealer at IG
Markets in Melbourne. “You never know when anything can happen.
People always sell first and ask questions later.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
