The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year Treasuries instead of German bunds may drop because
the European Central Bank is not likely to follow the Federal
Reserve’s decision yesterday to extend its asset purchases,
Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets said.  “It will be very clear after the ECB meeting today that
they are in stark contrast to where the Fed are, and that should
be a fairly strong primary driver for cross-market spreads,”
 Charles Diebel , head of market strategy in London, said in a
telephone interview today. “The 10-year Treasury note-bund
spread should get to parity and potentially beyond in the coming
weeks.”[bn:WBTKR=GDBR10:IND]   The 10-year Treasury-bund yield spread [] last reached parity
in June 2009, according to Bloomberg generic data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
