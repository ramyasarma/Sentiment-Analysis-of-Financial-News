The Polish zloty advanced to the
strongest level in more than six months after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said it will expand measures to boost the economy and
investors speculated interest rates may rise in Poland.  The zloty appreciated as much as 1 percent to 3.8907 per
euro, the highest since April 27 before paring gains to trade at
3.8940 as of 2:08 p.m. in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
