French stocks advanced to their
highest level since April after the U.S. Federal Reserve
announced an additional $600 billion of bond purchases to
bolster the economic recovery. France’s CAC 40 Index surged 1.9
percent to 3,916.78 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Paris, while the
SBF 120 Index rose 1.8 percent to 2,920.01.  The following stocks rose or fell in the French equity
market. Company symbols are in parentheses.  Alcatel-Lucent SA  (ALU FP) slumped 7.9 percent to 2.33
euros, its biggest drop since February. France’s largest
telecommunications equipment maker reported an operating margin
below some analysts’ estimates. Alcatel reported an adjusted
gross margin of 33.8 percent in the third quarter, compared with
33.4 percent a year ago, even as it posted a surprise 25 million
euro ($35.6 million) profit aided by a one-time pension gain and
higher sales.  “The margin wasn’t as good as expected, and the surprise
was more based on financial factors than operations,”  Mirko Maier , an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuertemmberg in Stuttgart,
said by phone.  Alstom SA  (ALO FP) lost 1.7 percent to 35.80 euros as the
world’s third-largest power-equipment maker reported a worse-
than-estimated 29 percent drop in first-half profit after
utility companies delayed orders for power plants. Chief
Executive Officer  Patrick Kron  said that the company faces
pressure on margins.  Axa SA  (CS FP) rallied 2.8 percent to 13.44 euros as
Europe’s second-biggest insurer was raised to “hold” from
“sell” at ING Group NV.  BNP Paribas SA  (BNP FP) jumped 3.7 percent to 54.37 euros,
the biggest advance in a month. France’s biggest bank reported a
46 percent increase in third-quarter profit, helped by its
consumer-banking networks in France, Belgium and the U.S.  Net income rose to 1.91 billion euros from 1.31 billion
euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said in a
statement today, beating the 1.75 billion-euro average estimate
of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The jump in retail
earnings more than offset lower corporate- and investment-
banking profit.  Competitor Societe Generale SA (GLE FP), France’s second-
largest bank, surged 4.5 percent to 44.85 euros. The lender was
raised to “outperform” from “neutral” at Macquarie Group
Ltd.  Cap Gemini SA  (CAP FP), Europe’s largest computer-services
company, lost 4.5 percent to 34.95 euros after Chief Financial
Officer Nicolas Dufourcq said sales growth is likely to be at
the low end of forecasts.  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  (EAD FP) slumped
4.1 percent to 18.26 euros, the biggest decline since July.
Airbus SAS has started an investigation into the Qantas Airways-
operated A380 that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore
today after one of its four Rolls-Royce Group Plc engines failed
during a flight. Rolls Royce said it will cooperate with the
authorities. Airbus has no information yet on what caused the
incident, spokesman  Sean Lee  said in a telephone interview.  Imerys SA  (NK FP) soared 6.6 percent to 46.35 euros, the
biggest gain since May. The French mineral processing company
reported nine-month net income of 186.3 million euros, compared
with 33.6 million euros a year earlier.  Lafarge SA  (LG FP), the world’s biggest cement maker,
gained 5.7 percent to 45.24 euros. Competitor HeidelbergCement
AG rose the most in almost six months in Frankfurt trading as
its third-quarter profit more than doubled, beating estimates.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA  (MC FP) rose 2.8
percent to 119.20 euros, its sixth straight advance and the
longest winning streak this year. The world’s largest luxury-
goods maker isn’t ready to sell its 17.1 percent in Hermes
International SCA, Chief Executive Officer  Bernard Arnault  said
in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
