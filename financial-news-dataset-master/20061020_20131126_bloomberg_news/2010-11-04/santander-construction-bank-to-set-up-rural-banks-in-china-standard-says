Banco Santander SA and China
Construction Bank plan to jointly invest 500 million euros
setting up banks in rural China, the Standard said, citing
Santander Asia-Pacific Chief Executive Juan Manuel San Roman.  Santander will be the minority partner in the venture,
which plans to open at least 100 village banks within three
years, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said
today. Total investment may increase depending on the
shareholding of each individual bank, the Standard said.{}  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
