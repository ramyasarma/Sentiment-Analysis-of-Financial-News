Pakistan’s largest Shariah funds plan
to bid for the 80 billion rupees ($934 million) of Islamic debt
the government will offer in coming weeks after a 14-month
suspension of sales.  Al Meezan Investment Management Ltd.  and NBP Fullerton
Asset Management Ltd., which oversee a combined $380 million,
said they will submit bids for the 40 billion rupees of the
three-year notes on offer at a Nov. 8 auction and an equal
amount on Dec. 13. The yield will be more than the 12.64 percent
for similar-maturity, floating-rate sukuk sold in September 2009,
after inflation accelerated to a 17-month high, they said.  Pakistan is selling the debt as the nation’s Islamic
banking assets increased an average 30 percent in the past four
years to 411 billion rupees, or 6 percent of the total,
according to central bank estimates. Investors might prefer
securities due in a year or less after record floods in August
pushed up prices of goods and forced the central bank to raise
its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 17 months,
according to Al Meezan and NBP Fullerton.  “There’s big appetite for the sukuk since it’s the first
sale in a year,” Karachi-based  Muhammad Asad , who manages $210
million of Shariah-compliant funds as chief investment officer
at Al Meezan Investment, said in a phone interview on Nov. 1.
“There is bigger demand for short-term paper and the government
will have to come up with money-market products if it really
wants to boost the industry.”  Yield Premium  The government will have to pay a premium of at least 50
basis points, or 0.50 percentage point, more than benchmark six-
month non-Islamic bills,  Abdullah Ahmed , the treasurer at  Meezan
Bank Ltd ., the nation’s biggest Shariah-compliant lender, said
in an interview on Nov. 2. The spread may be 50 basis points to
80 basis points, according to  Ahmad Nouman , who helps manage
$170 million of Islamic and non-Islamic debt at Karachi-based
NBP Fullerton, a unit of National Bank of Pakistan, the nation’s
biggest lender.  Pakistan’s six-month securities that don’t comply with
religious principles were priced to yield 13.16 percent at an
auction yesterday, implying the new three-year sukuk will offer
a rate of between 13.66 percent and 13.96 percent, based on NBP
Fullerton’s forecasts. Malaysia, the world’s biggest market for
sukuk, sold 166-day Islamic bills at a yield of 2.88 percent at
an auction on Oct. 20, according to data from the central bank.  Global sales of sukuk, which pay asset returns to comply
with the religion’s ban on interest, fell 29 percent to $13.5
billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spreads Narrow  Shariah-compliant bonds returned 12.3 percent in 2010,
according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index . Debt
in developing markets gained 17 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
 EMBI Global Diversified Index  shows.  The difference between the average yield for emerging-
market sukuk and the London interbank offered rate shrank 25
basis points this quarter to 348 yesterday, according to the
 HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar Sukuk Index .  The extra yield investors demand to hold Dubai’s government
sukuk rather than Malaysia’s 3.928 percent Islamic note due June
2015 widened 12 basis points since Sept. 30 to 383, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on Malaysia’s note fell
two basis points to 2.38 percent today, according to prices
provided by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Long-Term Sukuk  Pakistan’s Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani estimates the
floods that ruined crops worth $3.3 billion may drive inflation
to as high as 20 percent this year. Government spending has also
increased to fund the fight against Taliban militants that has
been raging since 2003 in the northwest region bordering
Afghanistan.  The budget deficit may widen to 6 percent of gross domestic
product in the fiscal year ending June 30, compared with the
official target of 4 percent, according to a central bank report
on Oct. 25. The State Bank of Pakistan predicted economic growth
will slow to between 2 percent and 3 percent in the 2010-11
fiscal year after expanding by an estimated 4.1 percent in the
12 months ended June 30, 2010.  “The risk is not worth taking for anything due in more
than one year because of political and economic instability,”
 Salman Haider Sheikh , chief executive officer at Karachi-based
Faysal Asset Management Ltd., who manages the equivalent of $117
million, said in an Oct. 30 phone interview. He said he prefers
shorter-dated debt.  Sukuk Sales  State Bank of Pakistan increased its benchmark interest
rate by half a percentage point on Sept. 29 to 13.5 percent to
cool inflation after the nation’s most devastating floods washed
away crops, roads and bridges. The government’s  Federal Bureau
of Statistics  reported Oct. 11 that consumer prices rose 15.7
percent in September, after climbing 13.2 percent in August.  The country sold 42.2 billion rupees of three-year sukuk in
four installments in 2008 and 2009 and the government also
issued $600 million of global Islamic bonds for the first time
in January 2005 that matured in 2008.  The yield on the floating-rate local-currency sukuk due in
September 2011 was 11.25 percent in Karachi yesterday, according
to Meezan Bank’s Ahmed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
