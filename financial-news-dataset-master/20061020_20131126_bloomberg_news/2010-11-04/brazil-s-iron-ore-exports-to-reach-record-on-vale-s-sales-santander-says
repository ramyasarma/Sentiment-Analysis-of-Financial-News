Brazil will export a record amount of
 iron-ore  this year as companies such as  Vale SA  boost shipments
to help satisfy rising demand for the steelmaking ingredient
from China, Banco Santander SA said in a note to clients.  Brazil is likely to surpass the record 281.6 million tons
of ore shipped in 2008 after exporting 30.2 million tons last
month, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier, Santander
analysts led by  Felipe Reis  wrote today in a note to clients.  “Iron ore shipments should remain strong over the next
couple of months, leading to the best year ever in terms of
Brazilian exports of the commodity,” the analysts said.  Rio de Janeiro-based Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, will continue to enjoy “strong earnings momentum”
during this quarter and through 2011, the analysts said.  The company is Santander’s “top pick” among Brazilian
metals and mining companies, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
