Stocks  surged, sending the MSCI World
Index to a two-year high, and commodities rallied after the
Federal Reserve announced plans for more bond purchases and
earnings beat analyst estimates. The dollar sank and two- and
five-year Treasury yields touched record lows.  The MSCI World gained 2.4 percent at 4 p.m. in New York.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.9 percent to 1,221.06,
its highest since September 2008, as banks rallied amid
speculation they will be allowed to raise dividends. The Dollar
Index  fell  0.8 percent to an 11-month low. The S&P  GSCI 
commodities index added 2.3 percent as gold jumped to a record
high. Irish 10-year notes slid for an eighth day, the longest 
streak of declines in 23 months.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s $600 billion bond-buying
program reinforced optimism the world economy won’t deteriorate
and corporate profits will improve. The Bank of England said it
kept a 200 billion-pound ($324 billion) asset-purchase plan and
the European Central Bank left rates at a record low today. BNP
Paribas SA, the world’s biggest bank by assets, reported a 46
percent jump in third-quarter profit, and Qualcomm Inc., the
largest maker of mobile-phone chips, forecast higher earnings.  “It’s called the Bernanke put,” said  Stephen Wood , the
New York-based chief market strategist for Russell Investments,
which manages $140 billion. “The Fed wants to put a floor under
the employment market and asset prices. You’re seeing that being
reflected in both stock and commodities markets. Risk assets are
attractive globally.”  Global Rally  The Fed’s plan to inject more cash into the economy led
gold to a record, silver to a 30-year high and  emerging-market 
stocks to the highest level since June 2008. The U.S. currency
weakened against all 16 of its major peers, losing 2 percent
against the New Zealand dollar.  U.S. stocks extended gains as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank
of America Corp. surged at least 5.3 percent, sending a measure
financial companies to the biggest gain among 10 groups in the
S&P 500. The Fed may start allowing strong banks with good
capital levels to increase dividend payments, the Wall Street
Journal reported on its website, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  “It looks like banks will be able to go back to normal
dividend payments sooner than what many people expected,” said
 John Carey , a Boston-based money manager at Pioneer Investments,
which oversees about $250 billion. “That’s quite supportive for
prices and could be taken as a sign that banks are in a more
stable, financially secure condition.”  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. climbed 7 percent,
reaching its highest price since July 2008 as commodity prices
rallied amid the dollar’s decline. Qualcomm jumped 5.8 percent
after earnings forecasts topped estimates.  The lockstep relationship between U.S. stocks and Treasury
yields has disappeared in the past 2 1/2 months, while equities
and the dollar last moved this much in opposite directions in
1991, following the Fed’s plan to purchase assets in a technique
known as quantitative easing.  The shift began after Bernanke said on Aug. 27 that the
central bank “will do all that it can” to ensure a
continuation of the economic recovery and that more securities
purchases may be warranted if growth slows. The $600 billion
plan was announced on Nov. 3.  The  correlation  using 30 days of data for the S&P 500 and
the yield on 10-year Treasuries has plummeted to negative 0.05,
the lowest since July 2007, from 0.66 at the start of the fourth
quarter and a record 0.89 in June. The figure for the S&P 500
and Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against those
of six trading partners, sank to negative 0.68.  ‘Manipulating Market’  Correlation readings of 1 signal assets are moving the same
amount in the same direction, while negative 1 means identical
moves in opposite directions. Zero shows there’s no relationship
at all.  “What you should see in a recovery is yields going up and
stock prices going up at the same time,” said  Walter Todd , co-
chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital, which oversees
about $900 million. “That correlation is breaking down because
you’ve got a third party, i.e. the Fed, manipulating the
Treasury market.”  General Motors Co.  will reduce the U.S. government to a
minority shareholder as it seeks to raise as much as $10.6
billion in an initial public offering.  GM , 61 percent owned by
the U.S. Treasury Department, will sell 365 million shares at
$26 to $29 each, the company said yesterday in a filing with the
 Securities and Exchange Commission .  U.S. equity futures extended gains in pre-market trading
after a measure of U.S. worker productivity rose at a 1.9
percent annual pace in the third quarter, Labor Department
figures showed, surpassing the median forecast of 1 percent in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Another report showed more
Americans than predicted filed applications for jobless benefits.  Unemployment Rate  The Labor Department may say tomorrow that the  unemployment
rate  was 9.6 percent in October for a third month, according to
the median forecast of economists. Private payrolls, which
exclude government agencies, are projected to increase by 80,000,
the survey showed.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 1.6 percent to its
highest level since April 15. BNP Paribas jumped 3.7 percent in
Paris and Unilever rallied 6.3 percent in London. Swiss
Reinsurance Co. gained 6.4 percent in Zurich as it agreed to
repay the capital injected last year by Warren Buffett.
HeidelbergCement AG soared 8.9 percent as profit beat estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd.  advanced 6.6 percent to a record in
London after Canada blocked its $40 billion hostile takeover for
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. Potash Corp. sank 3.2 percent
in Toronto. Rolls-Royce Group Plc lost 5 percent after one of
its engines exploded in mid-flight, forcing Qantas Airways Ltd.
to ground its Airbus SAS A380 fleet. Airbus owner European
Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. fell 4.1 percent.  Emerging Markets  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  added 1.8 percent, heading
for the highest closing level since June 2008. India’s  Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index  surged 2.1 percent to a record.
Coal India Ltd. rallied 40 percent in its trading debut after
selling $3.4 billion of shares in the nation’s largest initial
public offering last month. The Shanghai Composite Index gained
1.9 percent, while indexes in Thailand, South Africa, Turkey and
Hungary increased more than 1 percent.  The yields on the five- and two-year Treasury notes  dropped 
to record lows of 1.0148 percent and 0.3118 percent respectively
after the Fed said yesterday it will focus its asset purchases
on medium-maturity debt. The German 30-year bond fell for the
first time in six days, sending the yield up six basis points to
2.90 percent.  Irish-German Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity benchmark German bunds  widened 
to a record 526 basis points amid concern the nation will
struggle to finance its deficit. The Portuguese-German gap
 increased  30 basis points to 418 basis points.  The dollar weakened 0.5 percent to $1.4205 per euro and
slipped 0.5 percent to 80.66 yen. The New Zealand dollar
strengthened 2 percent to 79.57 U.S. cents after a report showed
employers added more jobs in the third quarter than economists
estimated.  The pound climbed 1.3 percent to $1.6289, extending gains
after the Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate and
asset-purchase target unchanged.  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities climbed to the highest
level since October 2008. Silver futures surged 6.6 percent to
$26.043 an ounce on the Comex in New York and earlier topped $26
for the first time since 1980. Gold jumped to a record $1,391.80.
Cotton for December delivery surged 3.6 percent percent to an
all-time high in New York. Prices have more than doubled in the
past 12 months, reaching the highest since the fiber began
trading 140 years ago. Crude oil advanced 2.1 percent to $86.49
a barrel. Raw sugar jumped 5 percent and earlier touched 31.81
cents, the highest price since 1981.  To contact the reporter on this story:
