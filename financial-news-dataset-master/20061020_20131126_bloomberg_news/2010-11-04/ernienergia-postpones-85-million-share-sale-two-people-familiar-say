TerniEnergia SpA  postponed a share
sale of as much as 60 million euros ($85.4 million), according
to two people close to the deal.  The builder of solar power plants delayed the offer after
investors balked at the price indicated by the company, said the
people who declined to be identified because the information is
private.  A spokesman for the company declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
