Mizuho Financial Group Inc.  added two
bankers and plans to add more amid a push into trading high-
yield debt, bank officials said.  Randy Li  and  Robbie Goffin  are the senior members of a team
that focuses on unrated speculative debt and private placements,
said  Patrick Fay , Mizuho’s U.S. head of fixed income, in a phone
interview. They both joined the Japanese bank’s  U.S. unit in New
York  from StormHarbour Partners LP.  “This is part of our initiative to grow our trading
capabilities in high-yield securities,” Fay said. Mizuho plans
to recruit additional bankers to work on “more traditional”
junk-rated debt sales, he said.  Goffin joined last month as an executive director reporting
to  Timothy Murphy , U.S. sales manager for fixed income, Fay
said. Li, who started in September as a managing director,
reports to  Jerry Rizzieri , head of U.S. fixed-income trading.  The new team, known as the strategic credit group, aims to
provide independent credit analysis on the less-liquid bonds it
trades, Rizzieri said.  Mizuho ranked 19th among U.S. bond underwriters in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 21st during the year-earlier
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
