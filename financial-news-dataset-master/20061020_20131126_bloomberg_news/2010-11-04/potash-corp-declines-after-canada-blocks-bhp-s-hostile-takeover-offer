Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. 
fell the most in more than two months after Canada blocked  BHP
Billiton Ltd. ’s $40 billion hostile bid for the world’s largest
fertilizer producer.  Potash Corp.  dropped  $5.21, or 3.6 percent, to $140.29 at
10:13 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares earlier tumbled 3.8 percent to $139.91, the biggest
intraday decline since Aug. 11. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-
based company  gained  34 percent this year through yesterday.  “The stock is trading on its fundamentals” rather than
speculation that BHP will increase its offer,  Louis Meyer , a New
York-based special-situations analyst at Oscar Gruss & Son Inc.,
said today in a telephone interview.  Canada yesterday denied approval of BHP’s $130-a-share
offer for Potash Corp., saying the transaction wouldn’t provide
a “net benefit” to the country. BHP has 30 days to appeal, at
which point the government will make a final decision, according
to a statement read by Industry Minister  Tony Clement .  Clement declined to give additional reasons for the ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
