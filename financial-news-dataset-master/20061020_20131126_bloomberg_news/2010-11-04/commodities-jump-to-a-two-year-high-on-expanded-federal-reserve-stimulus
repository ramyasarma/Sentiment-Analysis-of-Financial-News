Commodities rose to a two-year high
after the Federal Reserve said it would expand steps to boost
the world’s largest economy, spurring demand for raw materials
as a hedge against inflation.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index  of 24 commodities gained
as much as 1.5 percent to 586.046 points, the highest level
since Oct. 3, 2008. It was at 585.241 points at 11:47 a.m. in
London. Palladium climbed to the highest price since 2001, and
white sugar reached a 21-year high. The U.S. Dollar Index fell
to the lowest level in almost 11 months.  The Fed said yesterday it would buy a further $600 billion
of Treasuries through June, expanding a stimulus program to cut
unemployment and avert deflation. The central bank also said it
will keep interest rates low for an “extended period.” The
Fed’s plan is showing signs of success as the economy has
improved, said economist  Dennis Gartman .  “The economy is beginning to show signs of strength,”
Gartman said in his Gartman Letter, a Suffolk, Virginia-based
daily report. “Things are indeed getting better, so the money
being force-fed into the system will find its way into equities
and into speculation in commodities.”  A weaker dollar makes commodities priced in the currency
cheaper in terms of other monies and fuels demand for raw
materials as an alternative investment. The dollar index, which
measures the greenback’s strength against six currencies, slid
as much as 0.9 percent to the lowest level since Dec. 8, 2009.  Gold, Silver  The  UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index  climbed
