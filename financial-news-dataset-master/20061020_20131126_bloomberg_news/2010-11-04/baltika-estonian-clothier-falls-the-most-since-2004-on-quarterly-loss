AS Baltika fell the most in more than
six years in Tallinn trading after the third-biggest Baltic
clothing company reported a wider third-quarter loss.  The stock declined as much as 20 percent to 0.96 euro at
the opening, the biggest plunge since February 2004. It traded
14.2 percent lower, at 1.03 euros, at 12:52 a.m. Including
today’s loss, it has gained 41 percent this year, compared with
a 65 percent rise for the 15-member Nasdaq OMX Tallinn index.  Baltika said after the end of trading yesterday that the
third-quarter net loss widened 16 percent from a year earlier,
to 33.5 million krooni ($3 million). It cited store-closure
costs, higher delivery charges and increased currency-exchange
losses caused by the weakening of the Russian rouble and the
Ukrainian hryvna against the Estonian kroon.  Revenue fell 6 percent, while  Apranga AB , the largest
Baltic clothing retailer and Baltika’s main competitor, has
reported that revenue grew 6.6 percent in the latest quarter.  “Baltika’s results are weaker than we had hoped they would
be, especially as Apranga’s turnover has been showing stronger
signs of improvement,”  Ivars Bergmanis , the head of
institutional equities at LHV Pank in Tallinn, said in an e-
mailed note to investors. The company’s retail sales in Russia
and Lithuania, as well as wholesale sales, trailed LHV’s
forecasts, he said.  Cost-Cutting  Baltika, which owns brands such as Monton, Mosaic and
Baltman, has reported losses since the fourth quarter of 2008,
as cost-cutting failed to make up for declining revenue. Baltika
raised 6.8 million euros through a share sale this year to pay
down debt.  Apranga shares jumped as much as 6.3 percent in Vilnius to
6.38 litas at 12:52 p.m., the highest level in more than two
years.  Retail revenue in Baltika’s key Baltic markets has
increased 0.5 percent in the past year. The region has been
through the deepest recession in the 27-member European Union in
past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
