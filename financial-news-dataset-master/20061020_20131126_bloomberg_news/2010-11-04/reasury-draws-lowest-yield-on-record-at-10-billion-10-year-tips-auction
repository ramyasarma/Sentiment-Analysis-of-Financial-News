The U.S. sold $10 billion of 10-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities at a record low yield of
0.409 percent, suggesting investors are confident the Federal
Reserve will be successful in re-inflating growth.  The previous low yield of 1.019 percent was set at a Sept.
2 auction. On Oct. 25, the U.S. sold $10 billion of five-year
TIPS at a negative yield, the first time investors were willing
to receive negative returns at a Treasury auction.  The central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee said yesterday they’ll expand purchases of Treasuries
at a pace of about $75 billion a month through June and “will
adjust the program as needed” to reduce unemployment and avert
deflation. The gap between 10-year yields on regular Treasuries
and TIPS has widened to 2.18 percentage points, near the highest
level in five months.  “Investors have confidence the Fed will win the battle
against deflation, and create an inflationary environment,”
said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8 billion at SEI Investments Co.
in Oaks, Pennsylvania. Simko began increasing his TIPS holdings
and reducing his stake in conventional Treasury debt in October.  A Bloomberg News survey of seven of the 18 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed forecast a yield of 0.372 percent at
today’s offering.  Inflation-indexed notes pay interest at lower rates than
nominal Treasuries on a principal amount that’s linked to the
Labor Department’s consumer price index. TIPS are the only
securities the Treasury will auction at a negative yield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
