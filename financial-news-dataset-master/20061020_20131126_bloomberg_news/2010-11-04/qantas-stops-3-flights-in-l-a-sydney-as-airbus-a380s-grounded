Qantas Airways Ltd.  stopped two
flights leaving Los Angeles and one in Sydney after grounding
its fleet of Airbus SAS A380s following an inflight engine
explosion.  Passengers will stay at the departure points until
replacement planes can be arranged, Qantas spokeswoman Emma
Kearns said by phone from Sydney. The carrier can use other
aircraft including its fleet of 21 Boeing Co. 747-400s, she
said.  The airline today halted all A380 services indefinitely
after an aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing in
Singapore following an engine blowout six minutes into the
flight. None of the 459 people onboard were hurt in the
incident.  Qantas A380s fly  daily services  to Los Angeles from Sydney
and three times a week from Melbourne. The aircraft also fly to
London from Melbourne every day except Mondays and Sundays, a
Qantas spokeswoman said today. A London-bound aircraft that came
via Hong Kong was moved straight into inspection after landing,
she said.  Qantas has another 14 A380s on order. Today’s incident
won’t affect these orders, Chief Executive Officer  Alan Joyce 
said at a press briefing in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
