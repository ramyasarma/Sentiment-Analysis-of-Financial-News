Tencent Holdings Ltd. , China’s
biggest Internet company by market value, fell the most in more
than two months in Hong Kong trading on concern it will lose
users after a dispute with a local security software provider.  Tencent, operator of the QQ instant-messaging service,
dropped 3.1 percent to HK$181.30, the biggest decline since Aug.
24. It’s the worst performing stock on Hong Kong’s benchmark
Hang Seng Index today.  QQ, with more than 600 million user accounts, will no
longer run on computers installed with software made by 360.cn,
Tencent said yesterday. As many as 3 percent of QQ subscribers
may be affected by the move, said  Muzhi Li , an analyst at Mizuho
Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.  “It’s a temporary impact,” said Li, who recommends buying
Tencent shares. Most QQ subscribers who cut down on their use
eventually will return to the service, Li said.  Catherine Chan , a spokeswoman for Shenzhen, China-based
Tencent, didn’t reply to four messages left on her office phone
and an e-mail seeking comment today.  360.cn is the biggest provider of free security software in
China, according to the company’s  website . A product made by
360.cn will disrupt QQ’s malware-detection features, Tencent
said.  Tencent is “forcing” users to un-install 360.cn’s
software, 360.cn said on its website yesterday. 360.cn will
ensure its software can be used together with QQ, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
