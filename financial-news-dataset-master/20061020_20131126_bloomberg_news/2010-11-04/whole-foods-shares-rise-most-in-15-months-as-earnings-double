Whole Foods Market Inc. , the largest
U.S. natural-goods grocer, rose the most in 15 months in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings
doubled and the company raised its profit forecast.  Net income in the quarter ended Sept. 26 climbed to
$57.5 million, or 33 cents a share, the Austin, Texas-based
company said in a statement yesterday. That compared with the
28-cent average of nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
The company boosted its fiscal 2011 profit forecast to as much
as $1.71 a share, from a previous high of $1.64.  Whole Foods  climbed  $5.38, or 13 percent, to $46.45 at
11:20 a.m. New York time. The stock reached $46.80 earlier for
its biggest intraday percentage gain since Aug. 5, 2009. Whole
Foods had  gained  50 percent this year before today, compared
with a 7.4 percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Whole Foods probably benefited  last quarter  from improving
sales at its former Wild Oats stores, according to  Bob Summers ,
an analyst at Susquehanna International Group LLP. Sales
increased as the grocer’s organic products appealed to higher-
wage earners less affected by the economic recession, the New
York-based analyst said in a Nov. 1 report.  Sales  at Whole Foods, led by co-Chief Executive Officers
 John Mackey  and  Walter Robb , rose 15 percent to $2.1 billion,
from $1.8 billion. That compared with the $2.07 billion average
of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income in the year ago period was $28.7 million, or 20
cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
