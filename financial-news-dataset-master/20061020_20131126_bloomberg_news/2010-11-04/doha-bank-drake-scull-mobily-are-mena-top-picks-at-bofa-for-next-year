Doha Bank QSC, Qatar’s third-biggest
bank, Dubai-based Drake & Scull International and Saudi Arabia’s
Etihad Etisalat Co. were named top picks for growth next year in
the Middle East and North Africa at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.  The United Arab Emirates-based First Gulf Bank PJSC and
Union National Bank PJSC as well as Oman-based Bank Muscat SAOG
will benefit from QE2, the bank said in a report dated Nov. 2.  QE2 refers to the second round of quantitative easing, or
asset purchases, that the Federal Reserve announced yesterday.  Bank of America forecasts 17 percent loan growth next year
for Doha Bank. Drake & Scull is “driven by rising construction
revenues in Saudi Arabia and Qatar,” while Etihad Etisalat,
also known as Mobily, benefits from “rising demand for wireless
data and enterprise communication in Saudi Arabia,” the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
