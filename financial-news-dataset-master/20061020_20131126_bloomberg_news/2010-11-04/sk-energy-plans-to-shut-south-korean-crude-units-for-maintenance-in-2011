SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s biggest
oil refiner, plans to shut two crude processing units at its
Ulsan refinery and one in Incheon for maintenance next year, a
company official said.  The refiner will close the 60,000-barrel-a-day No. 1 crude
distillation unit in Ulsan for 40 days between July and August
and the 260,000 barrel-a-day No. 5 unit for about a month
starting in May, said the official who asked not to be
identified because he isn’t authorized to talk to reporters
about the plans. At its Incheon complex, SK will shut the
200,000 barrel-a-day No. 2 unit for about 40 days starting June.  S-Oil Corp. , South Korea’s third-biggest oil refiner, will
shut the 240,000 barrel-a-day CDU at its Onsan refinery in May
while Hyundai Oilbank Co. plans to close the 110,000 barrel-a-
day No. 1 CDU at its Daesan refinery in March, officials from
the two companies said. Shin Jung Kuk, a spokesman for S-Oil,
said the company hasn’t decided next year’s maintenance
schedule.  The information from the refinery officials suggests at
least 17 percent of South Korea’s capacity will be shut in May,
which is likely to be the peak period for maintenance next year.
This year, most maintenance was done in the second half of
April. South Korean refiners usually shut units for checks once
every three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
