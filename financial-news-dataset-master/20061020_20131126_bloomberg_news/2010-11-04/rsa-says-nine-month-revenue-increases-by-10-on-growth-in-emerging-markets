RSA Insurance Group Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest non-life insurer by market value, said revenue climbed
10 percent in the first nine months of the year driven by growth
in emerging markets.  Net written premiums rose to 5.5 billion pounds ($8.9
billion) in the nine months to Sept. 30 from 5.03 billion pounds
a year earlier, the London-based insurer said today in a
statement. Emerging-market premiums were up 13 percent at
constant exchange rates to 683 million pounds.  “In what is a challenging year for the industry, we have
built good top-line momentum and have again driven the business
forward delivering strong premium growth in the U.K.,
international and emerging markets,” Chief Executive Officer
 Andy Haste  said in the statement. “We continue to supplement
organic growth with targeted acquisitions.”  RSA, which insures cars, ships and businesses, is seeking
to increase its share of its main markets including the U.K.,
Europe, Canada and South America by making acquisitions as
premium rates fall globally. The company last month agreed to
pay 259 million pounds for GCAN Insurance Co., which will make
it the fourth-biggest non-life insurer in Canada.  RSA made a 5 billion-pound bid for Aviva Plc’s U.K. non-
life division in July, which was rejected.  The firm expects its combined operating ratio to be around
its 95 percent target for 2010, it said today. The combined
operating ratio is a measure insurers use to show claims as a
percentage of premiums. The further the ratio is below 100
percent, the more profitable the insurer’s underwriting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
