Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s
second-largest reinsurer, said it has agreed to repay Warren
Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which injected 3 billion
Swiss francs of capital last year.  “Today we are pleased to report that our improved capital
position allowed us to reach an agreement to repay Berkshire
Hathaway, with no additional charge for bringing forward the
repayment date,” Swiss Re Chief Executive Officer Stefan Lippe
said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
