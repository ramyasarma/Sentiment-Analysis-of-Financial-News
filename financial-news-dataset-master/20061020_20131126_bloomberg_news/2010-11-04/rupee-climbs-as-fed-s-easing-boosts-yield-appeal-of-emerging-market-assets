India’s rupee rose for a third day,
its longest winning streak in three weeks, after the Federal
Reserve’s decision to ease monetary policy boosted the appeal of
higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The Fed yesterday said it will buy an additional $600
billion of Treasuries through June, a day after the  Reserve Bank
of India  raised its policy rates by a quarter-percentage point.
The currency also gained as the benchmark Sensex index of
equities climbed 2.1 percent to a record, fueling optimism
overseas investors will add to their record stock holdings.  “The Fed’s policy expansion and India’s recent rate hike
will combine to ensure that funds continue to flow into India
from yield hunters,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based
Asia economist at Capital Economics Ltd.  The rupee rose 0.3 percent, the most since Oct. 25, to
44.215 per dollar as of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has gained 5.2 percent
this year. It may appreciate past 43 in the coming weeks,
Varathan said.  India’s central bank on Nov. 2 increased its  repurchase
rate  by a quarter-point to 6.25 percent and the reverse
repurchase rate to 5.25 percent. Overseas investors have pumped
a net $26.3 billion into Indian stocks this year and a record $9
billion into bonds.  Benchmark 10-year government bonds in India yield 7.99
percent, compared with 2.57 percent on similar-dated U.S.
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The yield  difference  reached a
10-year high of 5.67 percentage points on Oct. 20.  Offshore forwards indicated the rupee will trade at 44.69
against the dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 44.86 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
