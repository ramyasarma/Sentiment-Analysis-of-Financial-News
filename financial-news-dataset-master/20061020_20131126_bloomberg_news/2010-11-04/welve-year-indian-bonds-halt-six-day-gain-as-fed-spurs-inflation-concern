India’s 12-year  bonds  fell, snapping
a six-day gain, on speculation a U.S. plan to release cash by
buying debt will spur fund inflows to emerging markets, boosting
money supply and stoking  inflation .  The yield on the most-traded 2022 note climbed from the
lowest level since September after the Federal Open Market
Committee yesterday said it will purchase an extra $600 billion
of Treasuries through June and kept a pledge to keep interest
rates low for an “extended period.” The  Reserve Bank of India 
raised borrowing costs on Nov. 2 for a sixth time this year to
cool inflation.  “The soft monetary stance of the Fed will make it
difficult for the RBI to fight inflationary pressures,”  J. Moses Harding , a Mumbai-based executive vice president at
IndusInd Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note today. Investors
would look “for the RBI to guide benchmark bond yields” higher,
he wrote.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due September 2022
climbed three basis points to 8.02 percent as of the 5 p.m.
close in Mumbai, paring this week’s declines to seven basis
points, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
price fell 0.20, or 20 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to
100.81.  India’s main inflation rate, measured by wholesale prices,
averaged 9.7 percent during the first nine months of 2010,
compared with 1.4 percent in the year-earlier period, government
data show. The Reserve Bank boosted its benchmark  repurchase 
rate this week by 0.25 percentage point to 6.25 percent, taking
this year’s total increase to 1.5 points.  Debt Auctions  The government raised 110 billion rupees ($2.5 billion)
today selling securities due 2015, 2022 and 2027 at an auction.  The nation sold 40 billion rupees of 7.17 percent, five-
year notes at a maximum yield of 7.8087 percent, the central
bank said in a statement. It auctioned 50 billion rupees of 12-
year debt at as much as 8.0104 percent and 20 billion rupees of
8.26 percent, 17-year securities at 8.3698 percent.  The Reserve Bank bought 83.5 billion rupees of existing
government bonds at a separate auction, after offering to
purchase as much as 120 billion rupees in debt.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive a floating
rate, climbed six basis points to 6.64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
