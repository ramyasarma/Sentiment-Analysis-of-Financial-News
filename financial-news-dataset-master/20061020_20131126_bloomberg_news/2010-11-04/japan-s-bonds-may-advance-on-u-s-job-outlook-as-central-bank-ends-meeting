Japanese  bonds  may rise for a third
day on concern a slowing U.S. recovery will hurt exporters’
earnings, boosting demand for the safety of government debt.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  are likely to drop from a five-
week high before a government report that economists say will
show the U.S. unemployment rate stayed near 10 percent in
October. The Bank of Japan is expected to decide at the end of a
two-day policy meeting today how it will buy exchange-traded
funds and real-estate investment trusts.  “The market will remain resilient,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief
strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., wrote in a report
today. “Bonds with the maturity of between seven and 10 years
will be relatively robust.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery finished at
143.38 in London yesterday, compared with 143.28 at the 3 p.m.
close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The contract will open for
trading at 9 a.m. Tokyo time.  The benchmark 10-year bond hasn’t traded yet today at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The yield on the 1 percent bond due in September 2020 fell one
basis point to 0.925 percent yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The U.S. unemployment rate held at 9.6 percent in October
for a third month, according to economists’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg before a Labor Department report scheduled to be
released today. Applications for jobless benefits rose last week
more than economists had estimated, Labor Department figures
showed yesterday.  BOJ Meeting  The yen traded at 80.76 per dollar today, after reaching a
15-year high of 80.22 on Nov. 1. A stronger yen reduces the
value of overseas sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  The BOJ unveiled a 5 trillion-yen ($62 billion) fund last
month to help stem deflation and shelter the nation’s expansion
from a strengthening yen.  The 1 percent bond due in September 2020 closed at 100.76
to yield 0.916 percent yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Yen
Bond Fixing Price. The level is an average rate set at 6:30 p.m.
in Tokyo by Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co., Citigroup
Global Markets Japan Inc., Mizuho Securities Co. and Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
