UniCredit , eastern Europe’s biggest
lender, doesn’t consider Kazakhstan a core market and may sell
its bank in the country, Chief Executive  Federico Ghizzoni  was
quoted as saying by German business newspaper Handelsblatt.  Ghizzoni also said he would review eastern European
countries in which Milan-based UniCredit’s units only ranked
"sixth, seventh or eighth" and could decide to give up parts of
its business, according to Handelsblatt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
