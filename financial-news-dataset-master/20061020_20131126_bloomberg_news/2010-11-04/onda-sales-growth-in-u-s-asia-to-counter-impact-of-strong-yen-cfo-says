Honda Motor Co. , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, said demand in North America and Asia’s
emerging markets will help offset the impact of the strong yen.  Honda will increase sales by at least 100,000 vehicles in
the U.S. and a further 100,000 in emerging markets, including
Thailand and India, annually over the next few years, Chief
Financial Officer  Yoichi Hojo  told reporters today in Tokyo.  The automaker last week raised its full-year net income
forecast 10 percent to 500 billion yen ($6.2 billion) as surging
car and motorcycle sales in Asia helped the company beat its
first-half target. A Federal Reserve plan to buy an additional
$600 billion of Treasuries through June will help prevent
further economic decline in the world’s second largest auto
market, Hojo said.  “The U.S. has deep pockets,” he said. “With a rising
population, demand will also grow. I don’t see a long-term
economic decline there.”  Honda’s U.S. sales increased 16 percent to 98,811 vehicles
in October from a year earlier, as light vehicle sales rose to
an annual rate of 12.3 million, the highest since August 2009.  Honda expects to spend about $1,500 per vehicle on
incentives in the U.S., $100 more than an earlier plan for this
fiscal year, Hojo said. While spending is rising for small
passenger models, it’s falling for light trucks, he said.  Light Trucks  Sales of Honda’s Pilot, Odyssey and CR-V larger models
account for about 45 percent of its U.S. sales, near a high of
48 percent, he said. Light trucks, which tend to be more
profitable than smaller vehicles, are selling better as gasoline
prices have stabilized, Hojo said.  Tokyo-based Honda rose 1.1 percent to 2,754 yen as of 2:48
p.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  shares  have fallen 11
percent this year.  Even as Honda raised its full-year profit estimate last
week, it lowered its outlook for the second half ending March 31
by 12 percent citing the yen’s strength and weaker than expected
demand in the U.S. and Europe.  The yen traded at 80.82 against the dollar as of 2:42 p.m.
in Tokyo after gaining to 80.22 on Nov. 1, the strongest level
since April 1995. Every one yen gain against the dollar reduces
Honda’s operating profit by 17 billion yen, according to the
company.  Separately, Hojo declined to comment on a Nikkei English
News report earlier today that the company plans to make hybrid
cars in China.  Honda, which sold 63 Civic hybrid sedans in the nation in
the nine months through September, has said it will introduce
its Insight and CR-Z hybrids there from 2012. That plan hasn’t
changed and Honda hasn’t decided if and when it will start
selling its new Fit hybrid hatchback in China, Hojo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
