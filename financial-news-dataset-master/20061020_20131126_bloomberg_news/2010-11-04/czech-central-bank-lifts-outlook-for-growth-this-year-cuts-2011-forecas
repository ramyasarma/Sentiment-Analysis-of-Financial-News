The Czech central bank raised its
outlook for growth this year to 2.3 percent from 1.6 percent in
its latest quarterly update of economic forecasts.  Gross domestic product is seen slowing next year to 1.2
percent from a rate of 1.8 percent made in the previous forecast
released in August.  “This year the economy has recovered from the recession,
but economic growth will slow down next year due mainly to
fiscal restriction and reappearance of more robust economic
recovery can be expected in 2012,” the central bank said in a
statement before a press conference today.  Czech inflation risks are “balanced” at present, the
central bank said, as it raised the forecast for consumer prices
in the fourth quarter of next year to 2 percent from 1.9 percent
previously and reduced the outlook for the first quarter of 2012
to 1.9 percent from a forecast of 2 percent previously.  “Headline inflation is currently close to the inflation
target and will remain at this level in the next two years,”
the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
