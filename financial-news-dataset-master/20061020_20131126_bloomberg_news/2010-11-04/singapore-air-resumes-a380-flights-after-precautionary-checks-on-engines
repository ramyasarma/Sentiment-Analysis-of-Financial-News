Singapore Airlines Ltd. said it has
begun returning its Airbus SAS A380 planes to service after
conducting “precuationary” checks on engines. While some
flights have departed, the situation “remains fluid” as the
carrier completes checks before returning all the planes to
service, Singapore Air said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
