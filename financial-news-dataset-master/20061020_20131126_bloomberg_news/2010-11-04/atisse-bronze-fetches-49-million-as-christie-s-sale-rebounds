Henri Matisse ’s life-size bronze of a
woman’s back sold for $48.8 million, an auction record for the
artist, as  Christie’s International ’s New York Impressionist and
modern art sale sustained a recovery from last year’s recession.  As collector and SAC Capital Advisors LP Founder  Steven A. Cohen  watched from a sky box, last night’s two-hour auction
totaled $231.4 million with commissions, slightly above
Christie’s $198.3 million low estimate, which doesn’t include
the buyers’ premiums. The result was triple Christie’s year-ago
tally of $74.2 million.  Dealers said the sale was strong for quality items, with 80
percent of the 84 lots finding buyers, similar to the previous
night’s sale at Sotheby’s, which totaled $227.6 million, led by
a $69 million  Amedeo Modigliani  nude.  “We are in a happier place,” said New York dealer Maxwell
Davidson IV, after the sale. “There is not as much doom and
gloom. If there’s quality, you can sell it.”  Davidson bought a $1.4 million pink  Wassily Kandinsky 
watercolor and a blue Picasso watercolor for $818,500.  The Matisse, from an edition of 10, was conceived in 1930
and cast in 1978, 24 years after the artist’s death. Dealer
 Larry Gagosian  bought it for an unnamed client.  The artist’s previous auction record was $45.9 million for
a floral still life, at Christie’s in Paris last year. He made
four versions of his celebrated back series, tinkering from 1908
to 1931, with the forms becoming gradually more abstract. Major
museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern and
the Centre  Georges Pompidou , all own complete sets of the four.  ‘Starving for Quality’  “There was healthy, healthy bidding for star material,”
said New York dealer John Driscoll of Babcock Galleries, who
bought a small  Georges Seurat  painting for $2.1 million.
“People are starving for quality material.”  Still, the sale result was below the $335.5 million of
Impressionist and modern art Christie’s sold in May, which was
boosted by a $106.5 million Picasso.  Henry Kravis  was one of yesterday’s top sellers. Hours
after the buyout firm he co-founded reported a 61 percent drop
in quarterly profit, Kravis sold $50 million of art, people
familiar with the transactions said. Kravis parted with four
works, including a 1913 cubist Juan Gris painting of a
fragmented violin and guitar. The canvas sold for a record
auction price of $28.6 million to an anonymous European
collector.  The four works said to belong to Kravis were described by
Christie’s as hailing from “a distinguished private
collection.” A KKR spokeswoman didn’t return an e-mail last
night seeking comment.  Picasso Head  The group of works included a mysterious 1927 hunter-green
interior by Swiss painter  Paul Klee , selling for $5 million, and
 Joan Miro ’s yellow and blue 1938 “L’Air,” populated by
biomorphic forms floating in the sky, for $10.3 million. A
Picasso drawing of a man’s head made $6.1 million.  The estate of Los Angeles computer pioneer  Max Palevsky 
contributed a pair of  Fernand Leger  paintings of cubist-inspired,
proto-robotic women. A 1927 crouching nude, set against a tomato
red field, “Femme sur fond rouge, femme assise,” fetched $6.4
million from private dealer Daniella  Luxembourg . A second Leger,
of a woman stirring a cup of tea, sold for $8.1 million.  The sale had 10 Picassos, including the evening’s biggest
casualty. The 1921 “Maternite,” featuring a boxy woman
cradling a child and rendered in a muted palette of flesh tones
on gray and white, was estimated to sell for as much as $10
million. The painting, from the estate of “Dick Tracy” radio
producer Himan Brown, failed to find a buyer.  Next week, contemporary art goes on the block, including a
 Roy Lichtenstein  painting owned by  Steve Wynn , “Ohhh...
Alright...” (1964), that Christie’s estimates will fetch $40
million. Lichtenstein’s current auction record is $16.3 million.  Christie’s charges buyers 25 percent of the hammer price up
to $50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1 million, and 12
percent above $1 million.  To contact the reporters on the story:
