The euro stayed higher against the
dollar after the European Central Bank left its benchmark
interest rate unchanged, a day after the Federal Reserve decided
to increase asset purchases by $600 billion.  The bank’s decision to keep the refinancing rate at 1
percent was predicted by all 55 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  will hold a press
conference at 2:30 p.m. in Frankfurt. He said after the bank’s
Oct. 7 meeting that there was “absolutely no change” in the
ECB’s stance from a month earlier and it would continue to
gradually phase out its non-standard liquidity measures.  “Clearly if the ECB were to express concern about the
euro’s gains recently that might knock it short term,”  Adam Cole , head of global currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets in
London, said before the decision. “There isn’t a lot on the
ECB’s agenda.”  The euro gained 0.8 percent to $1.4253 as of 12:52 p.m. in
London after reaching $1.4262. The 16-nation currency ended
little changed on Oct. 7, when Trichet told reporters he opposed
“disorderly” moves in currency markets.  The Dollar Index slumped to its weakest level since
December after the Fed said late yesterday it was compelled to
act because “progress” toward the objectives of full
employment and stable prices “has been disappointingly slow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
