HMS Astute, the British nuclear-
powered submarine that ran aground off Scotland’s Isle of Skye
last month, collided with one of the vessels charged with its
rescue, the defense ministry said.  “We can confirm HMS Astute was in a minor collision with
one of the tugs that assisted in refloating her,” Ministry of
Defence spokeswoman Beth Cowley said in an e-mailed statement
today. The submarine remains at the Faslane naval base “whilst
investigations continue,” according to the statement.  The submarine became stuck during sea trials on Oct. 22 in
a channel between the island and the Scottish mainland.  Astute, which was commissioned into the Royal Navy on Aug.
27, is “the U.K.’s most powerful attack submarine,” the
ministry said on its website. Built by BAE Systems Plc, it is
quieter than other submarines in the fleet, even though it is
50 percent bigger, and can circumnavigate the world without
surfacing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
