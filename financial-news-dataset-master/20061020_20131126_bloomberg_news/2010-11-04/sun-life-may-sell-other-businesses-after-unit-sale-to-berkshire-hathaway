Sun Life Financial Inc. , which agreed
last week to sell a reinsurance business to  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., may sell other operations, Chief
Executive Officer  Donald Stewart  said.  “There are areas that we’ve seen as having less growth
potential,” said Stewart, who turns 64 this week. “To the
extent that some of these businesses are capital intensive, we
would take a closer look at them.”  Toronto-based Sun Life, Canada’s third-biggest insurer,
doesn’t expect to announce unit sales any time soon, he said in
an interview today.  The owner of Boston-based MFS Investment Management
reported late yesterday third-quarter profit of C$453 million
($452.1 million), or 79 cents a share, compared with a year-
earlier net loss of C$140 million, or 25 cents.  Robert Sedran ,
an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said in a note to clients that
profit topped his estimate of 63 cents a share.  Stewart told investors on a conference call today that the
sale of its reinsurance business to Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire may result in a gain of as much as C$30 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
