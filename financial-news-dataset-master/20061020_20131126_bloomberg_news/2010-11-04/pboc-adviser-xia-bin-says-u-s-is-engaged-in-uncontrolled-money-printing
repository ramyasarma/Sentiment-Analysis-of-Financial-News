Chinese central bank adviser Xia Bin
said that U.S. quantitative easing amounts to “uncontrolled”
money printing.  The most urgent need for many emerging economies is to curb
capital inflows, he said at a forum in Beijing.  Many people are worried about what to do after the latest
U.S. move, he said. Xia is an academic member of the central
bank’s monetary policy committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
