             The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  fell for the
sixth time in seven days, losing 2 percent to 669.78 at 3 p.m. in
New York. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, whose members have a
median market value 22 times larger than the  Russell 2000 ,
dropped 1.5 percent. The measures have declined 13 percent and 11
percent, respectively, this year.  
 Mortgage-related companies dropped. Thornburg Mortgage Inc.
(TMA US) lost the most since its initial public offering in 1993,
tumbling 50 percent to $1.71. The lender that's been running
short on cash since August received a default notice from its
lenders. ``Bankruptcy is now a more likely outcome,'' RBC Capital
Markets analyst Jason Arnold wrote in a report today.  
 Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NLY)   dropped 16 percent
to $16.10. The real estate investment trust was removed from the
``Best Idea List'' at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., as was
Capstead Mortgage Corp. (CMO US), which plunged 24 percent to
$12.33.  
 MFA Mortgage Investments Inc. (MFA)   slid 19 percent to
$7.06.  Anworth Mortgage Asset Corp. (ANH)   dropped 26 percent
to $6.54. Both real estate investment trusts were cut to ``market
perform'' from ``outperform'' today by Keefe Bruyette.  
 Athenahealth Inc. (ATHN)   fell the most since its initial
public offering in September, losing 21 percent to $26. The
medical  software company  run by a cousin of President  George W.
Bush  said officers can sell shares from the initial public
offering in two weeks. A block of insider shares may push prices
down if released into the market, said Piper Jaffray & Co.
analyst Sean Wieland.  
 DXP Enterprises Inc. (DXPE)   gained the most since Feb. 1,
rising 7 percent to $39.36. The industrial services company said
fourth-quarter profit increased to 84 cents a share, from 61
cents a year earlier, as sales rose.  
 Flow International Corp. (FLOW)   rose the most since Feb.
4, climbing 19 percent to $8.96. The maker of high-pressure
waterjets posted third-quarter fiscal profit of 16 cents a share.
That exceeded the average analyst estimate by 50 percent,
according to Bloomberg  data.   
 MercadoLibre Inc. (MELI)   had the biggest gain since Feb.
27, rising 6.7 percent to $39.60. The Latin American online-auction site partly owned by EBay Inc. posted fourth-quarter
earnings that were twice the average analyst estimate, according
to Bloomberg  data.   
 Steinway Musical Instruments Inc. (LVB)   rose the most
since February 2006, adding 10 percent to $27.67. The maker of
its namesake pianos posted fourth-quarter profit that was 24
percent higher than the average analyst estimate, according to
Bloomberg  data.   
      Omrix Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (OMRI US) had the steepest
decline since its initial public offering in 2006, plunging 42
percent to $14.63. The maker of treatments for surgical bleeding
posted fourth-quarter earnings that were 26 percent below the
average analyst estimate, according to Bloomberg  data .  
 Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (OWW)   had the biggest drop since
its initial public offering in July, losing 21 percent to $5.20.
The Internet travel agency reported fourth-quarter sales of $197
million. That's 1.7 percent less than the average analyst
estimate, according to Bloomberg  data .
