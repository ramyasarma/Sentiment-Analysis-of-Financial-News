             Saks Inc. (SKS) , the U.S. luxury retailer
targeted for a possible takeover by Icelandic investment company
Baugur Group HF, dropped the most in more than a year in New
York trading after Banc of America Securities LLC downgraded its
shares.  Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)  also fell after sales missed estimates.  
 Banc of America  analyst  Dana Cohen cut her recommendation
on Saks stock to ``neutral'' from ``buy'' today, citing slowing
sales of  luxury goods . Shoppers have curbed spending as they
face median  home prices  that probably dropped for the first time
since the Great Depression.  
 ``The high end is the latest to go and has the farthest to
fall,'' New York-based Cohen wrote in her report today.  
 Saks said yesterday that sales growth slowed last month to
3.4 percent after climbing 4.1 percent in January. Nordstrom,
based in Seattle, said today February sales fell 5.8 percent,
more than analysts' average estimate of 3.5 percent.  
 Saks dropped $2.20, or 14 percent, to $13.04 at 4:32 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. That was the
biggest  decline  since December 2006. The shares lost more than a
third of their value this year. Nordstrom was down $2.23, or 6.3
percent, to $35, the biggest retreat since Jan. 4.  
 Baugur, owner of the House of Fraser department store
chain, said in a U.S. regulatory filing Oct. 29 that it may make
a joint bid for Saks, which operates 54 department stores.
Baugur said it held an 8.5 percent stake in Saks.
