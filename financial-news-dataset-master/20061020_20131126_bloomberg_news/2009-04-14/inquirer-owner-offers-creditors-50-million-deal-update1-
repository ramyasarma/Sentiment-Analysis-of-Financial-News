             Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the
owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily
News, offered creditors $50 million as part of a plan that would
allow the company to exit bankruptcy.  
 The investor group that purchased the newspapers in 2006
made the offer in a meeting with creditors on March 9, according
to papers filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Philadelphia.  
 The proposal would give the creditors new cash as well as
notes, financial adviser Sonenshine Partners LLC said in the
filing. New York-based Sonenshine said it’s representing
Philadelphia Newspapers in ongoing talks related to the
proposal.  
 On Feb. 22, Philadelphia Newspapers became at least the
fourth newspaper publisher to file for bankruptcy protection
since December. The biggest was Tribune Co., owner of the Los
Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. Both companies entered
bankruptcy after being acquired with borrowed money.  
 Philadelphia Newspapers won permission yesterday to use the
company’s cash to fund operations while it attempts to
reorganize.  
 The case is In re Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, 09-11204,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of  Pennsylvania 
(Philadelphia).
