             Sweden’s Richard Johnson won golf’s
Scandinavian Masters with a birdie at the final hole today in
Stockholm to secure a first European Tour win since 2002.  
 The 33-year-old finished on 11-under-par 277, one shot
ahead of Argentina’s Rafa Echenique, with Italy’s Edoardo
Molinari on 9-under. South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen, last
week’s British Open champion, was among three players on 8-
under.  
 Johnson, who was 1-under in his final round, collects a
check for 333,330 euros ($430,300), the biggest of his career.
Oosthuizen slipped out of contention with a 1-over 73, while
Echenique, Molinari and Australia’s Brett Rumford were 3-under
today.  
 South Korea’s KJ Choi, the overnight leader with Johnson,
slipped to 13th, seven shots back, following a round that
included a quadruple bogey and a double bogey.
