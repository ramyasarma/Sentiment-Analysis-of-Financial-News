             India’s GMR Infrastructure Ltd. is
seeking a “limited number” of buyers for its 50 percent stake
in InterGen NV, and may not sell the holding if it can’t raise
about $1 billion from the sale, the Wall Street Journal
reported.  
 The process is in the early stages, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. GMR
declined to comment to the Journal.
