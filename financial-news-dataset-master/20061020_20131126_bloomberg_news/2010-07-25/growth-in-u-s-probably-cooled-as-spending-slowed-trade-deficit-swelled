             The U.S. economy expanded at a
slower pace in the second quarter as consumer spending cooled
and the trade deficit swelled, economists project a report this
week will show.  
 Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual pace
after increasing at a 2.7 percent rate in the first three months
of the year, according to the median estimate of 68 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a July 30 Commerce Department
report. Other data may show gains in business investment are
taking up some of the slack, while housing is mired in a slump.  
 Less growth heading into the second half of the year means
employers will hesitate to take on staff and will keep a lid on
prices to spur sales. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
last week said the central bank is prepared to take further
policy actions if the world’s largest economy “doesn’t continue
to improve.”  
 “We’re experiencing a relatively subdued and fragile
recovery,” said  John Herrmann , a senior fixed-income strategist
at State Street Global Markets LLC in Boston. “That fits with
subdued payroll growth and subdued inflation going forward.”  
 The GDP estimate is the first of three for the quarter,
with the other releases scheduled in August and September when
more information becomes available.  
 Consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of
the economy, increased at a 2.4 percent annual rate last quarter
after growing at a 3 percent pace the previous three months,
economists project the report will show.  
 Spending Outlook  
 A lack of jobs, a loss of household wealth stemming from
the slumps in stocks and housing, tight credit and the need to
reduce debt and rebuild savings are among reasons economists
forecast spending will be slow to recover. Purchases will
increase at a 2.6 percent pace on average in the second half of
the year, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed earlier this month.  
 Company payrolls rose by 83,000 in June, while overall the
economy lost 125,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported July 2.
The  unemployment rate  fell to 9.5 percent as discouraged workers
dropped out of the labor force.  
 A widening trade gap and a slower pace of inventory
restocking also depressed growth last quarter, economists said.
 Stockpiles  climbed 0.1 percent in May, the smallest gain this
year, according to Commerce Department data.  
 Imports Climb  
 The trade deficit  adjusted  for inflation, the figures used
in calculating GDP, averaged $45.1 billion a month in April and
May, up from $42.3 billion a month in the first quarter as
imports climbed faster than exports, according to figures from
the Commerce Department.  
 The government will estimate June figures for trade and
inventories, which will not be available until next month, in
calculating growth.  
 Business investment is one area charging ahead. Spending on
equipment and software contributed 0.7 percentage point to
growth in the first three months of the year.  
 A report from the Commerce Department on July 28 will show
 orders  for goods meant to last at least three years increased 1
percent in June, the sixth gain in seven months, according to
the survey median.  
 The recent surge in imports reflects in part the increases
in U.S. business investment on new equipment.  United Parcel
Service Inc. , the world’s largest package-delivery company,
raised its annual profit forecast last week after net income
last quarter jumped 90 percent from the same period in 2009.  
 Economic Bellwether  
 Domestic shipments will continue to grow roughly in line
with U.S. gross domestic product, and exports from Europe and
Asia will continue to improve, even if the pace “moderates”
somewhat in the second half of this year, UPS executives said.
UPS and FedEx Corp. are considered economic bellwethers because
they deliver goods ranging from clothing to pharmaceuticals and
industrial parts.  
 “Despite the anticipated slow pace of the U.S. recovery
and a cautious outlook for Europe, we are confident in our
ability to grow the business and improve profits,” Chief
Financial Officer  Kurt Kuehn  said in a July 22 statement.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index  has dropped 5.7 percent
since the end of the first quarter on concerns that the European
debt crisis will curb global growth. The index climbed 0.8
percent to 1,102.66 at the 4 p.m. close on July 23, its first
gain above 1,100 in a month.  
 One industry likely to weigh on growth in the coming months
is housing.  Sales  of new homes rose to a 311,000 annual pace in
June, second to May’s 300,000 rate as the lowest on record, the
survey median showed ahead of a report tomorrow from the
Commerce Department. Purchases plunged an unprecedented 33
percent in May after a tax credit expired on April 30.  
 Confidence measures will show Americans grew more
pessimistic this month about the economy. The Reuters/University
of Michigan index of  consumer sentiment , due July 30, dropped to
67 from 76 in June, according to the survey median. The
Conference Board’s  consumer confidence  gauge dropped to 51 from
52.9, the survey showed ahead of the July 27 report.
