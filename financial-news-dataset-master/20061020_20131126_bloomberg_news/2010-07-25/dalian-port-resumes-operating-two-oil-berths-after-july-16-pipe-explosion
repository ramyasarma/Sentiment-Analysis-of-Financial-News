             Dalian Port (PDA) Co. , operator of
China’s largest crude-oil terminal, said two oil berths resumed
operations after a pipeline explosion caused a spill.  
 A third berth, capable of receiving 300,000-deadweight-ton
crude oil tankers, will restart “in the near future,” the
company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  
 The July 16 explosion led to a spill that covered more than
183 square kilometers (70 square miles) off China’s northeastern
coast, forcing the closure of berths and beaches. The incident
occurred after workers injected oxidizing desulfurizer into the
pipeline after a tanker had finished unloading its oil, Dalian
Port said today, citing government findings.  
 The probe, carried out by the State Administration of Work
Safety and the Ministry of Public Security, found that the
desulfurizer, produced by Tianjin-based Huishengda Petroleum
Technology Co., was injected into the pipeline by Shanghai-based
Q.PRO Inspection and Technical Service Co., the official Xinhua
News Agency reported July 23.  
 Dalian Port said it restarted the 150,000-deadweight-ton No.
1 berth that handles crude-oil shipments and the 80,000-
deadweight-ton No. 2 berth handling both crude-oil and refined-
oil-product cargoes.
