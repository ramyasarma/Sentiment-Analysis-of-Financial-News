             Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  met with 10 spies deported from the U.S. earlier this
month and sang Soviet era patriotic songs with them.  
 Their return was the result of betrayal by traitors whose
names are known to the Russian state, Putin said in Ukraine
yesterday, according to a Russian government website.  
 “Traitors always end badly,” Putin said. “They end up in
the gutter usually as drunks or drug addicts.”  
 Ten convicted members of a Russian spy ring in the U.S.
returned to Moscow on July 12 in an exchange for 4 men jailed
in Russia. Putin said that he and the spies sang “How the
Motherland Begins” and other songs.  
 The spies would likely find jobs in “respectable places”
and have “bright and interesting lives,” Putin said.
