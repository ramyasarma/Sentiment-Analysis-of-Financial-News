             Doha Bank QSC , Qatar’s third-biggest
bank by revenue, aims to sell bonds by the end of this year in
both dollars and the local riyal currency, the lender’s chief
executive officer said.  
 The bond offering “will definitely happen, as I see it,”
 Raghavan Seetharaman  said in an interview in the Qatari capital
Doha today. “I expressed my intention to” sell the bonds in
dollars and riyals to the central bank, which must approve the
transaction, he said.  
 Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, is trying to develop a domestic debt market. The government
sold 12 billion riyals ($3.3 billion) of bonds and Islamic debt
this year. The  Qatar Exchange , the country’s equity market, may
start bond trading before September, the exchange’s Chief
Executive Officer  Andre Went  said in February.  
 “The domestic market is there now,” Seetharaman said. He
said last month the bank sought to raise as much as $1 billion
in the fourth quarter by selling bonds. The money is likely to
be raised for five years and is meant to “fix the maturity
mismatch” on the bank’s balance sheet, he said.  
 Doha Bank posted a less-than-expected drop in second-
quarter profit after the country’s sovereign wealth fund
declined to take dividends. Net income fell 5.4 percent to 299.7
million riyals ($82.4 million) from the year-earlier period.
That compares with the mean estimate of 235.7 million riyals by
three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Doha Bank shares  rose 1.1 percent to close at 44.4 riyals
today.
