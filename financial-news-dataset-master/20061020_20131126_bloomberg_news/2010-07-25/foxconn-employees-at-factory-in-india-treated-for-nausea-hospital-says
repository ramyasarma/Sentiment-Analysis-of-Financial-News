             About 150 workers at a Foxconn
Technology Group factory in the southern Indian city of Chennai
were treated for nausea and breathlessness yesterday at nearby
 Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre .  
 Most of the workers were discharged while some remain under
treatment, T.G. Nallamuthu, a hospital spokesman, said today by
telephone. He declined to say what caused the illness.  
 Edmund Ding , a spokesman for the Foxconn Group, wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  
 Foxconn’s Chennai factory was shut down after workers fell
ill from inhaling pesticide fumes, the Hindu Business Line
newspaper  reported , without saying where it got the information.
Thousands of workers sat out in protest, asking for the factory
premises to be checked, the daily said.
