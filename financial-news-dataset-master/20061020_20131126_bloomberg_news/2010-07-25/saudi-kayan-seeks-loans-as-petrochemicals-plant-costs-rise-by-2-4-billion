             Saudi Kayan, a unit of Saudi Basic
Industries Corp., said the cost of its Jubail petrochemicals
plant may rise 24 percent, or 9 billion riyals, according to a
statement to the Saudi bourse today.  
 The company will seek loans and funds from shareholders to
cover the rise in cost and prevent any delay in completion
dates, the statement cited Chairman Mutalq al-Morished as
saying. The company said it started the trial run of its olefins
plant at the complex today.
