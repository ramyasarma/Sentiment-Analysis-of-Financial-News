             Australia’s Liberal party is gaining
on the ruling Labor party in popularity, a Newspoll opinion
survey shows. The opposition coalition has 48 percent of voter
support, three percentage points more than the last poll,
compared with 52 percent for Labor, which lost three points,
according to a telephone survey of 1,720 voters taken between
July 23 and 25 and published in the Australian newspaper. Some
34 percent of people said opposition leader Tony Abbott is a
better prime minister, compared with 27 percent in the previous
poll, and 50 percent favor incumbent Julia Gillard, from 57
percent. The margin of error is 2.4 percentage points.
