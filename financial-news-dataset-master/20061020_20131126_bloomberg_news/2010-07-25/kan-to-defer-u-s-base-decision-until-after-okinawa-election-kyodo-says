             Japan will defer a decision on
construction methods and other details for a planned relocated
U.S. military base on the southern island of Okinawa, Kyodo News
reported, citing unidentified government sources.  
 Japan doesn’t want to conclude the plan before local
Okinawa elections on Nov. 28, the report said.  
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada
and Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa will discuss the matter
tomorrow, the report said.
