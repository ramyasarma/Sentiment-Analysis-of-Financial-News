             South Africa’s government may review
the award of prospecting rights for the Sishen iron-ore mine to
Imperial Crown Trading, the  Sunday Independent  reported, citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the discussions.  
 Reassessing the award of the right is an informal guarantee
given by the government during its mediation between  Kumba Iron
Ore Ltd.  and  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd.  over a disputed
supply agreement, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  
 Kumba, which owns the remaining rights at Sishen, is
disputing a decision by the Mineral Resources Ministry to award
21.4 percent of the prospecting rights to Imperial.
