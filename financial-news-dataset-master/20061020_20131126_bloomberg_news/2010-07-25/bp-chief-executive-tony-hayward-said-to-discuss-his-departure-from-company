             BP Plc  Chief Executive  Tony Hayward 
is discussing his departure from the company with its board
after a leak at one of its Gulf of Mexico wells caused the
largest oil spill in U.S. history, two people familiar with the
matter said today.  
 Robert Dudley , the U.S. director of BP’s oil spill response
unit, is the person most likely to succeed Hayward after a
handover period, one of the people said. An announcement may be
made July 27, when the London-based company releases its second-
quarter results, the person said. Both people declined to be
identified by name because final decisions haven’t been taken.  
 “Hayward turned the heat up on himself, and some of his
misstatements served to boost the move for him to be replaced,”
 Ted Harper , who helps manage $6.8 billion at Frost Investment
Advisors in Houston, said today. He doesn’t hold BP stock. “It
was pretty obvious that once the crisis had abated somewhat,
they would be looking to consider Dudley for the role.”  
 Hayward, 53, has faced public anger in the U.S. and
criticism from lawmakers over his handling of the spill that was
triggered by an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig,
which killed 11 people. The company’s market value has fallen by
about 50 billion pounds ($77 billion) as it has battled to stop
the spill. The well has now been sealed, and BP plans to
permanently plug it with cement next month.  
 BP’s board will meet tomorrow to discuss the future of
Hayward, who has run the company since 2007, one of the people
familiar said.  
 ‘Support of Board’  
 Hayward “has the support of the board,” BP spokesman  Mark Salt  said by mobile phone today in London.  
 While seeking to contain public outrage over the
environmental damage, Hayward made several gaffes, including
saying he wanted his “life back” and calling the spill
“relatively tiny” in a “very big ocean.” The well spewed
35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day from a mile-deep in the
water, according to a U.S. government-led panel of scientists.  
 The New York Daily News said he was “the most hated -- and
clueless -- man in America.” U.S. President Barack Obama said
he would have fired Hayward, while White House Chief of Staff
 Rahm Emanuel  said on ABC in June that “Tony Hayward isn’t going
to have a second career in PR consulting” and criticized the
CEO for taking a yachting trip.  
 Dudley, 54, was born in New York and grew up in
Mississippi, part of the Gulf Coast region suffering
environmental and economic damage from the spill. BP on June 23
appointed him to manage its response to the leak.  
 Dudley  
 He’s spent about 30 years in the oil industry, including a
stint as CEO of BP’s Russian joint venture, TNK-BP from 2003.
That job ended after disputes with Russian partners led to
Dudley fleeing Russia in 2008, citing “sustained harassment”
amid court battles and labor and tax inspections.  
 “The fact he is American should help to keep things a
little more straight-forward in his dealings with the U.S.
administration,” Harper said. “Dudley’s most important task will
continue to be making sure that the well is capped.”  
 U.S. Representative  Edward Markey  of Massachusetts said in
a statement today, “The new leaders of BP will have an uphill
climb to correct the legacy left by Hayward.” Markey, a
Democrat, is chairman of the Select Committee on Energy
Independence and Global Warming.  
 The company’s success capping the runaway well after three
months will keep its final liability for the spill to $33
billion, according to analysts.  
 ‘Doomsday Scenarios’  
 The 40-foot stack of valves halted the flow a week before
Tropical Storm Bonnie blew through and forced a temporary halt
to drilling of a relief well that will seal the leak for good.
Worst-case forecasts for the crisis had pegged the bill as high
as $100 billion.  
 “The doomsday scenarios are looking very remote,” said
 Jason Kenney , an analyst at ING Wholesale Banking in Edinburgh
who expects BP’s final bill to reach $28 billion. “The biggest
estimates were based on massive criminal negligence and the
worst-case of the well not being stopped at all.”  
 BP will probably say net income before extraordinary items
rose to $5 billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier because of
higher oil prices and better refinery earnings, according to the
median of 12 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey . The $4
billion the company has spent on the spill so far won’t be
included in that figure. The increase in underlying profit will
help BP in its campaign to bolster its financial position.  
 Second-Quarter Results  
 “In terms of second-quarter performance, they’ll be quite
strong aside from the spill,” said  Alastair Syme , an analyst at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in London who predicts the bill will rise
to about $17 billion. “The market will try to press them on
future costs.”  
 The median estimate of the total costs is $33 billion, a
Bloomberg News survey of 11 analysts shows, with predictions
ranging from $17 billion to $60 billion. Louisiana Treasurer
John Kennedy has said the total cost of the spill may reach $100
billion.  
 Tropical storm Bonnie stopped BP’s drilling operation near
the Macondo well, setting back a permanent solution by about two
weeks. Without the week-old cap holding back the flow, the spill
would have worsened.  
 Exxon Mobil Corp ., the biggest publicly traded oil company,
and Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc, Europe’s largest, will report
earnings July 29.  
 Stock Plunges  
 The spill has wiped about 40 percent of BP’s  market value 
since the Deepwater Horizon blowout. That’s more than double the
median estimate among analysts for the cost of the spill,
suggesting investors are taking dimmer view of BP’s future. The
stock dropped 2.1 percent last week.  
 Before the spill, Hayward led BP to become the biggest non-
state producer of oil and gas last year and aimed to increase
output by as much as 2 percent a year through 2015. The company
now plans to sell assets, reduce investments and suspend the $10
billion annual dividend for three quarters to pay for the spill.  
 BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg agreed with President Obama
last month to set aside $20 billion for spill victims and
cleanup. The payments into the fund will take place over several
quarters, starting with $3 billion in the third quarter and $2
billion in the fourth.  
 BP said last week that it sold $7 billion of assets in the
U.S., Canada and Egypt to Apache Corp. It has also said it plans
to sell holdings in Pakistan and Vietnam. BP may revive the sale
of fields in Alaska after they failed to make it into the Apache
deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said last week.  
 Refining Margins  
 The 61 percent increase in oil prices since the beginning
of 2009 may bolster BP’s revenue across the world. In the first
quarter, BP profit more than doubled from a year earlier. In
March, BP agreed to buy $7 billion of assets from Devon Energy
Corp. in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and Azerbaijan.  
 Refining margins are also picking up after averaging $5.49
in the second quarter from $3.08 in the first three months of
the year, according to BP.  
 BP’s own survey of analysts showed a mean estimate of $5
billion for so-called replacement cost profit, with a range of
$4.83 billion to $5.29 billion. Chief Financial Officer  Byron Grote  told investors on June 4 that the company will treat spill
costs as a non-operating, identified item and that it will
create a separate area on the income statement for it.  
 None of the analysts in the Bloomberg Survey had changed
their cost estimates since BP stopped the flow of oil from the
Macondo well this month. Politics will determine BP’s eventual
bill, and the U.S. will ultimately want to keep BP alive, said
 Gudmund Halle Isfeldt , an analyst at DnB NOR ASA in Oslo.  
 “There has to be some limitation on the costs,” said
Isfeldt. “If BP can go bankrupt, who will want to drill in the
U.S. anymore?”
