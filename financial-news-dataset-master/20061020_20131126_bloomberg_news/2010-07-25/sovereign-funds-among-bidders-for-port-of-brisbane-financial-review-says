             Global Infrastructure Partners,
Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and HRL Morrison and
Infratil are leading three groups that are among the first-round
bidders for Australia’s Port of Brisbane, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its Street Talk column. Sovereign
wealth funds from Singapore and Malaysia are also bidding for
the A$2.5 billion asset, according to the report. All five
offers are believed to be fully funded, the newspaper said.
