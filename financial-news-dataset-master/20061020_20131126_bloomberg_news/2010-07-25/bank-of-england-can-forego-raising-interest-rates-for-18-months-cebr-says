             The Bank of England won’t need to
raise its benchmark interest rate for at least 18 months as the
aftermath of the recession defuses price pressures, the Centre
for Economics and Business Research said.  
 U.K.  inflation  will slow “sharply” from a pace of 2.9
percent this September to 2.2 percent in February next year, the
London-based research group said in a report today. The rate of
annual consumer-price gains will then slow to 1.6 percent by
February 2012, the CEBR said.  
 “Our forecasts suggest that excess capacity, which pulls
inflation down, is likely for at least the next four years,”
CEBR Chief Executive Officer  Douglas McWilliams  said in the
report. “On this basis there is, therefore, no need to raise
interest rates for at least the next 18 months.”  
 Inflation slowed from a 17-month high in April and was at
3.2 percent in June, above the government’s 3 percent limit.
