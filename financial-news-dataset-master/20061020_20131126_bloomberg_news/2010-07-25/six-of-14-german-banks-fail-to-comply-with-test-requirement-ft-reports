             Six of 14 German banks did not
disclose a breakdown of sovereign debt holdings as stipulated by
the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, the Financial
Times reported, citing Arnoud Vossen, secretary-general of the
regulator.  
 Every other European bank except Greece’s Agricultural Bank
of Greece, which failed the test, complied with the required
disclosure, the FT said.  
          
          


  
     
       
     
           
                           
                 
                 
                                       
                                   
               
                        
           
                          July 26 (Bloomberg) -- David Forrester, a currency economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore, talks with Bloomberg's Linzie Janis about the outlook for the euro. 
     The combination of growing confidence in Europe’s economy and mounting evidence of a slowdown in the U.S. is driving euro bears into hiding. After tracking the euro’s slide from about $1.45 at the beginning of 2010, the median forecast of currency strategists has stayed within two cents of $1.20 since the start of June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Forrester, speaking from Singapore, also discusses the results of stress tests on European banks released last week.
