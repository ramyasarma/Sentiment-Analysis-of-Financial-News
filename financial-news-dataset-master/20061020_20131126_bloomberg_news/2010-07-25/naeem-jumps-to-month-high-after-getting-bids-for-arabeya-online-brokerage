             Naeem Holding , Egypt’s third-largest
publicly traded investment bank, rose to the highest level in
more than a month after saying it received bids for Arabeya
Online, the company’s Web-based brokerage arm.  
 Naeem gained 4.4 percent to 47 cents at 12:06 p.m. in
Cairo, its highest intraday level since June 21.  
 Naeem received final offers for 90 percent of Arabeya
Online, the Cairo-based company said in a regulatory filing to
the Egyptian Exchange today. Naeem first said it was seeking to
sell Arabeya Online on June 6.  
 Arabeya Online was ranked the 10th most active brokerage in
Egypt by value in the second quarter, executing 3.3 billion
pounds ($580 million) in trades over the period, according to
Egyptian Exchange figures.
