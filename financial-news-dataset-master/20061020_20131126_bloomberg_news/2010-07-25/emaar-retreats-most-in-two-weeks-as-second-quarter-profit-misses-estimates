since July 7, to 3.29 dirhams as of 11:48 a.m. in the emirate.

Financial Market General Index dropped 1 percent.  
 Net income  was 802 million dirhams ($218 million) after a
loss of 1.28 billion dirhams a year earlier, the Dubai-based
company said on July 22. Analysts predicted a profit of 958.7
million dirhams, according to the  average  of six analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.
