             Fuji Electric Holdings Co. will
increase this fiscal year’s semiconductor investment by 20
percent from an earlier plan to 12 billion yen ($137 million),
the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information. The company expects growing demand for
power chips, the report said.
