             The relocation of about 8,000 U.S.
Marines from Japan’s Okinawa prefecture to Guam may be delayed
until 2017 or later, the Asahi newspaper reported, citing a U.S.
budget committee report. The move had been planned for 2014.  
 The U.S. wants to improve water and sewage infrastructure
on Guam, the Asahi reported in its English language edition.
