             South Africa rugby center Jaque
Fourie and Australia fly-half Quade Cooper have been suspended
for making dangerous tackles in yesterday’s Test match at
Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.      
 Fourie’s four-week ban, following a foul on Richard Brown,
covers two Currie Cup matches and the Tri-Nations Test against
New Zealand on Aug. 21.  
 Cooper was banned for two weeks for his challenge on Morne
Steyn. He will miss Australia’s forthcoming Bledisloe Cup Tests
against the All Blacks in Melbourne and Christchurch.  
 Australia won yesterday’s game 30-13. It’s the third
straight Tri-Nations match this year after which players have
been banned.  
 The SANZAR ruling body announced the bans in media
releases.
