             Sony Corp. may post first-quarter
operating profit of between 10 billion yen and 30 billion yen,
compared with a year-earlier loss, Nikkei English News said,
without citing anyone.   
 Earnings were helped by increased sales of digital cameras
and personal computers in emerging countries, the report said.
The company’s game and mobile phone divisions returned to 
profit after cost savings, the Nikkei said.
