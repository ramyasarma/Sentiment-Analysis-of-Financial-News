             The science-fiction thriller
“Inception” was the top film at U.S. and Canadian theaters for
a second consecutive weekend, taking in $43.5 million in ticket
sales for Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros.  
 The  Angelina Jolie  action film “Salt” made its debut in
second place with $36.5 million for Sony Corp., researcher
 Hollywood.com Box-Office  said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. The weekend’s other new film, “Ramona and Beezus,”
was sixth with $8 million.  
 “Inception,” director  Christopher Nolan ’s first film
since “The Dark Knight” was released in 2008, is the third
first-place opening for Time Warner this year. Sales were helped
by critical praise, getting a favorable evaluation from 156 of
187 reviews compiled on the fan site Rottentomatoes.com.  
 “It’s two things: fantastic word-of-mouth and solid repeat
business,” said  Gitesh Pandya , editor of Box Office Guru LLC.
“It’s the kind of movie people want to see a second time. You
don’t necessarily absorb everything the first time around.”  
 The movie stars  Leonardo Di Caprio  as a member of a special
team that enters the dreams of others to steal secrets. Ellen
Page and  Marion Cotillard  co-star. “Inception’s” sales
declined 31 percent from last weekend. The typical drop for most
releases is 40 percent to 60 percent in the second week, Pandya
said.  
 “It shows that the movie has terrific legs going
forward,” he said. “I think it’s going to gross a minimum
of $250 million just in North America and it has a reasonable
shot of getting close to $300 million.”  
 ‘Salt’  
 Warner Bros. ranks fourth among major studios in U.S. sales
with $960.3 million through July 22, according to  Box Office
Mojo , a research company in Sherman Oaks, California.  
 In “Salt,” Jolie plays a CIA agent who goes on the run
after she is accused of being a Russian double agent. She must
evade pursuers while trying to save the life of her husband.
 Liev Schreiber  and  Chiwetel Ejiofor  co-star.  
 “Despicable Me,” from NBC Universal, was third with sales
of $24.1 million. The animated film tells the story of an
underworld creature who conspires to steal the moon and features
the voices of  Steve Carell  and Ken Jeong.  
 “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” from Walt Disney Co.,
was fourth with sales of $9.69 million. The movie stars Nicolas
Cage as a sorcerer who recruits a younger aide to help him
defend New York from a rival magician.  
 ‘Ramona and Beezus’  
 “Toy Story 3” was fifth with $9.03 million for Disney’s
Pixar studio. The sequel brings back  Tom Hanks  as the voice of
Woody, who leads his toy companions in an escape from day care.
The movie has had sales of $379.5 million in six weeks of
release.  
 “Ramona and Beezus,” which finished sixth, is based on
the Beverly Cleary books and follows the adventures a young
girl, Ramona Quimby. The film, from News Corp.’s Twentieth
Century Fox, stars Joey King as Ramona and Selena Gomez as older
sister Beezus.  
 Weekend sales for the top 12 films rose to $156.8 million
from $141.5 million a year earlier, Hollywood.com
said. Year-to-date receipts total $6.49 billion, up 4.5
percent from $6.21 billion. Attendance has fallen 2 percent
