             The U.S. special envoy to
Afghanistan and Pakistan offered encouragement today for
negotiations Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  has held with
Pakistani officials and Taliban leaders.  
 Karzai’s meeting with Pakistan’s top national security
officials “is a good thing, not a bad thing,”  Richard Holbrooke  said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” The U.S.
supports overtures to the Taliban by Karzai, he said.  
 “Among the Taliban leadership, there are some people who
are reconcilable and some are not,” Holbrooke said. “We
support a policy in which the Afghan government of President
Karzai takes the lead.”  
 Meetings between Karzai and the Pakistani security
officials, Army chief General Ashfaq Kiyani and intelligence
director Lieutenant General  Ahmed Shuja Pasha , have prompted
concern in neighboring countries, particularly India, the
Washington Post reported today, citing diplomatic and government
officials.  
 Neighboring governments fear the meetings may move Karzai
closer to a wish to negotiate with Taliban leaders and bring
some of them into his government, the Post reported.  
 India, Iran and Afghanistan’s northern neighbors have
expressed concern that a settlement with elements of the Taliban
would strengthen the influence of the Afghanistan’s Pashtun
population, which is the country’s largest ethnic group and is
closely tied to Pakistan, the Post said.  
 Ethnic Minorities  
 Such ties may come at the cost of Afghanistan’s Tajik,
Uzbek and Hazara ethnic minorities, which are linked to other
neighboring countries, the newspaper said.  
 India and Pakistan are strategic rivals wary of
developments that could enhance the influence of the other.  
 The U.S. seeks to “reduce the gap” between Pakistan and
Afghanistan “while taking into account the strategic interests
of India and other regional neighbors,” Holbrooke said.  
 General  Stanley McChrystal , then the commander of U.S.
forces in Afghanistan, was present at the meeting between Karzai
and Kiyani, Holbrooke said. The new commander, General  David Petraeus , “will continue to play the same role, if not more
so,” he said.  
 The U.S. government has had “no direct contact” with
Taliban leaders while the Karzai government explores a
reconciliation.  
 “They have to reach political arrangements,” Holbrooke
said. “That is up to them.”
