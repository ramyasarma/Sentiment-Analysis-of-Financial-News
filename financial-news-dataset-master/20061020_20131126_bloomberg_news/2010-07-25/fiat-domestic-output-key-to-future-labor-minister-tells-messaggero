             Italian Labor Minister Maurizio
Sacconi urged unions to be more flexible in negotiations aimed
at keeping car production in Italy, which he said was key to the
country’s future, according to an interview in il Messaggero
newspaper.  
 Sacconi is scheduled to meet with company executives and
unions in Turin on Wednesday. The aim of this week’s talks will
be to convince Fiat to increase car production in Italy rather
than move some of it to Serbia, Sacconi said.
