             West Ham has been offered the
opportunity to sign soccer’s two-time World Player of the Year
Ronaldinho from AC Milan for 6 million pounds ($9.3 million),
the People reported, without citing anyone.  
 Milan wants to sell the 30-year-old Brazilian, who earns
150,000 pounds a week, to cut its wage bill, the newspaper
reported. Ronaldinho would demand at least 90,000 pounds a week
to join the Hammers, the People added.  
 West Ham owners David Sullivan and David Gold have been
trying to make a “marquee signing,” with moves for Joe Cole,
Thierry Henry and David Beckham all failing, the People said.
