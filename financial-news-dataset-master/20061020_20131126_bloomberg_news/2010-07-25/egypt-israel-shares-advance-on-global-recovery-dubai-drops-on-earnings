             Egypt’s  benchmark index rose  to the
highest in almost a month, leading Middle East markets higher,
as concern about the global economic recovery eased and earnings
in the U.S. boosted investor confidence. Dubai shares declined.  
 Orascom Telecom Holding SAE  of Egypt, the Middle East’s
biggest mobile-telephone company by subscribers, advanced to the
highest level in two weeks.  Naeem Holding , Egypt’s third-largest
investment bank, gained the most in more than a month. The EGX30
Index gained 1.4 percent to 6,111.95 at the close in Cairo, the
highest level since June 29. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  slipped
0.2 percent.  
 “We’re continuing to catch up with the positive movements
in the U.S. and European markets,” said Cairo-based Amr Elfeky,
head of technical analysis at Cairo Capital Securities.  
 U.S. stocks rose last week after better-than-estimated
earnings at companies from United Parcel Service Inc. to Apple
Inc. and Ford Motor Co. lifted confidence the world’s largest
economy is recovering. The  S&P 500  gained 3.6 percent to
1,102.66 in the week ended July 23. European stocks also
advanced and the  Stoxx 600  climbed 3.2 percent in the week.  
 Egypt’s  Orascom Telecom  gained 2.7 percent to 4.99 Egyptian
pounds, the highest since July 11. Naeem Holding rose the most
since June 17 after it said it received final offers for 90
percent of its Web-based brokerage arm Arabeya Online.  
 Israel’s  TA-25 Index  closed up less than 0.1 percent at
1,119.03, after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent.  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  slid the most in 21 months on
concern about its Copaxone drug for multiple sclerosis after the
U.S. Food and Drug administration approved marketing a generic
version of Danofi-Aventis SA’s Lovenox anti-clotting drug. The
decision may affect Copaxone because both drugs have a complex
molecular structure, said Natali Gotlieb, a Tel Aviv-based
analyst at IBI.  
 Delek Real Estate  advanced 6.9 percent, the most since July
4, to 1.578 shekels. The property company said it’s in talks to
acquire as much as 80 percent of Tamir Fishman Real Estate Fund
Ltd. in exchange for its holding in Elad Israel Residences Ltd.  
 Israel’s benchmark 10-year Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 fell 0.15 shekel to 106.08. The yield on the 5 percent
notes rose two basis points to 4.51 percent. The shekel was
little changed on July 23, rising less than 0.1 percent to
3.8499 per dollar.  
 Dubai’s benchmark DFM General Index declined 1.4 percent,
the most since June 29, to 1,506.95, led by  Emaar Properties
PJSC  and Dubai Financial Market PJSC as earnings disappointed.  
 Emaar Disappoints  
 Emaar, the builder of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai,
retreated 3.6 percent, the most in almost two months, to 3.25
dirhams after profit fell short of analysts’ estimates. Emaar
has 26 percent weighting on  Dubai’s benchmark index .  
 Net income  was 802 million dirhams ($218 million) after a
loss of 1.28 billion dirhams a year earlier, the Dubai-based
company said July 22. Analysts predicted a profit of 958.7
million dirhams, according to the  average  of six analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  
 “Dubai is pricing in earnings,” said  Ali Khan , head of
cash-equity trading at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital Ltd. “Emaar
earnings were lighter than expected and the DFM slightly weaker.
That is pulling the market down.”  
 Dubai Financial Market , the only publicly traded Gulf Arab
bourse, declined 3.3 percent, the biggest drop since June 29, to
1.47 dirhams after second-quarter profit dropped 80 percent.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  rose 0.3 percent and Oman’s measure
increased 0.8 percent. The  Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  advanced
0.5 percent and Abu Dhabi’s  measure  gained 0.3 percent. Saudi
Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  fell 0.2 percent and Bahrain’s
 gauge  slid 0.7 percent.
