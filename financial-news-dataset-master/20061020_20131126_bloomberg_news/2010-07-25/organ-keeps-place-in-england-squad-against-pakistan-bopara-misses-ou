             Eoin Morgan keeps his place in
England’s 12-man squad for the first of four cricket Tests
against Pakistan in Nottingham, starting in four days.  
 Bowler Stuart Broad and all-rounder Paul Collingwood 
return after being rested for the series against Bangladesh.
There’s no place for Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan or James Tredwell
in the squad announced today by the England and Wales Cricket
Board.  
 Pakistan yesterday beat Australia in Test cricket for the
first time since 1995, winning by three wickets at Headingley in
Leeds. The two game series was drawn 1-1.  
 England squad: A. Strauss (captain), J. Anderson, S. Broad,
P. Collingwood, A. Cook, S. Finn, E. Morgan, K. Pietersen, M.
Prior, A. Shahzad, G. Swann, J. Trott.
