             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. ,
the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, fell the most in 21
months on concern sales of its Copaxone multiple sclerosis drug
may decline if U.S. regulators approve rival medications.  
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on July 23 approved
the marketing of generic versions of Sanofi-Aventis SA’s Lovenox
anti-clotting drug from  Novartis AG  and  Momenta Pharmaceuticals
Inc.  The decision may affect Copaxone because both drugs have a
complex molecular structure, Natali Gotlieb, a Tel Aviv-based
analyst at IBI, said today in an e-mailed report.  
 The shares  slid  6.5 percent, the biggest decline since
October 2008, to 197.30 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv. The stock earlier had lost as much as 8 percent, the most
since June 2006.  
 Copaxone, Teva’s top-selling product, accounts for about 20
percent of the company’s sales,  David Levinson , an analyst at
 Bank Hapoalim Ltd.  said in an e-mailed note. “There is no doubt
we are at an end of a Copaxone era,” he said. “If  Momenta 
succeeded in receiving an approval for one complicated molecule,
it may receive an approval for the Copaxone soon.”  
 Approval of a Copaxone generic may take “a while” as its
molecular structure is “more complicated” than Lovenox,” said
IBI’s Gotlieb. “Teva is prepared for a decrease in the Copaxone
sales and already included that in its guidance,” she said.
