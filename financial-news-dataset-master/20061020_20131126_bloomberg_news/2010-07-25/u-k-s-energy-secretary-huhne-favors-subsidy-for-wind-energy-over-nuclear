             Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne  favors
harnessing both offshore and onshore wind power, saying the U.K.
won’t subsidize a new generation of nuclear power stations.  
 Huhne said in an interview with Sky News today that wind
energy deserves government aid because the industry is in its
infancy, while nuclear power has been well established over
decades. The Dogger Bank in the north east of England, off the
North Sea, was an area for development for offshore wind
turbines, he said.  
 “There are two different types of subsidy; one is that we
have an overall framework to make sure that we get low-carbon
electricity and that we become more energy self-sufficient --
that will be available to everybody” Huhne told Sky News in an
interview ahead of a July 27 announcement to Parliament.  
 Huhne said the government will “encourage” wind
technology at the beginning and when it is cost-competitive, it
can “fly on its own.”  
 “No special subsidies for nuclear compared with these
infant technologies,” he said.  
 The  Sunday Telegraph , which published an interview with the
Liberal Democrat Huhne containing similar comments, said his
remarks are likely to alarm the Conservatives, the senior
partner in the coalition government, which favor nuclear power.  
 Under the coalition agreement, which set out the
government’s program, Liberal Democrat lawmakers are allowed to
abstain in any vote on nuclear power which reflects the party’s
long-held opposition to it, the paper said.
