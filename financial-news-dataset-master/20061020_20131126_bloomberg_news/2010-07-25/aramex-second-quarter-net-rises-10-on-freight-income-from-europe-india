             Aramex PJSC , a United Arab Emirates-
based logistics company, said second-quarter profit rose 10
percent as freight services grew in Europe and India.  
 Net income advanced to 55 million dirhams ($15 million)
from 50 million dirhams in the year-earlier period, Aramex said
in a  statement  to the Dubai bourse today. Revenue rose 15
percent to 557 million dirhams.  
 The results were “mainly due to an increase of business
across the  company’s operations  and strong growth in freight
services in Europe and India,” the company said. Aramex had a
net profit margin of 10 percent in the quarter “as it continued
to focus on operational cost efficiency,” it said.  
 The company has “strong cash position” and remains “focused
on investing and expanding in emerging markets such as those in
Africa, Southeast Asia and Commonwealth of Independent States
countries,” Chief Executive Officer  Fadi Ghandour  said in the
statement.  
 Aramex shares  closed unchanged at 1.67 dirhams in Dubai
today before the results were announced. The stock has gained 17
percent this year, compared with a 16 percent drop in the
benchmark  Dubai Financial Market General Index.
