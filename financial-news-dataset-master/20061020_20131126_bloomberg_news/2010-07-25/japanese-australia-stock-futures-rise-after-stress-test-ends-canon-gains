             Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  rose as the results of the stress test among European
banks reduced economic uncertainties and as the yen weakened.  
 American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. , a camera maker
that gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, jumped
1.6 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Sony
Corp. climbed 0.8 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the
Japanese electronics maker returned to profit in the first
quarter. ADRs of Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest
mining company, gained 1 percent after metal prices increased.  
 Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
September closed at 9,505 in Chicago on July 23, compared with
9,435 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,510 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index  climbed 0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s  NZX
50 Index  gained 0.4 percent in Wellington.  
 “European banks will have to raise less capital than some
people expected, so that’s positive for investors,” said
 Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co.
in Tokyo. “Anxieties will ease.”  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent
today. In New York, the S&P 500 Index advanced 0.8 percent to
1,102.66 on July 23 after speculation that a bio technology firm
Genzyme Corp. may be bought spurred optimism that acquisitions
are accelerating and General Electric Co. boosted its dividend.  
 Stress Test  
 European regulators found that seven banks need to raise a
combined 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of capital. Germany’s
Hypo Real Estate Holding AG, Agricultural Bank of Greece SA and
five Spanish savings banks didn’t have adequate reserves to
maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent in the
event of a recession and sovereign-debt crisis, lenders and
regulators said on July 23.  
 The banks that failed the stress tests are in “close
contact” with national authorities over how they will raise
capital, said the Committee of European Banking Supervisors,
which ran the assessments of 91 lenders.  
 Before the results were published, analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. estimated that lenders would need to raise 38
billion euros and Barclays Capital said they would require as
much as 85 billion euros.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has declined 2.5 percent in
2010, compared with a 1.1 percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 0.8
percent gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.2 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.4 times for the S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 The yen depreciated to 87.53, compared with 86.93 against
the dollar at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the euro, Japan’s currency weakened to 112.87 from
111.98. The weaker yen boosts the value of sales generated
overseas in local terms for Japanese companies.  
 The London Metals Index, a  measure  of six metals including
copper and zinc, increased for five consecutive sessions, rising
0.2 percent.
