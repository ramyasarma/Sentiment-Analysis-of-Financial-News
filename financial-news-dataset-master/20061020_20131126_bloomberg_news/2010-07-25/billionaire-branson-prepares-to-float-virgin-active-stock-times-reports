             Richard Branson  is preparing to
publically list  Virgin Group Ltd’s  Virgin Active unit in an
offering that could value the chain of health and fitness clubs
at 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion), the Sunday Times reported.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc have been hired by Branson to work on the
listing, the newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources.  
 The preparations may be delayed should market turbulence
continue after the summer, the Times said. Previous attempts to
list Virgin Active were shelved in 2007.
