             Nigeria set up a committee to come
up with ways of increasing the amount of cocoa that’s processed
locally, the Nigerian Television Authority reported, citing
Vice-President Mohammed Namandi Sambo.  
 The committee will review the challenges facing Nigerian
cocoa processors and suggest solutions to President  Goodluck Jonathan  within six weeks, the state-owned broadcaster said.  
 Nigeria is the fourth-largest producer of the chocolate-
ingredient, after the  Ivory Coast , Ghana and Indonesia.
