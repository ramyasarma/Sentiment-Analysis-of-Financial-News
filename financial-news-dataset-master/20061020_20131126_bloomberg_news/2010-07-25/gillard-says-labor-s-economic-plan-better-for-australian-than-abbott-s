             Australian Prime Minister Julia
Gillard says her Labor party has a better economic plan for the
nation than the opposition coalition and that her compromise
over the mining tax has provided certainty for the nation’s
resources companies.  
 Gillard made the comments in her opening address during a
televised leaders debate before a national election on Aug. 21.  
 Tony Abbott, the leader for the Liberal-National coalition,
criticized the mining tax for threatening the country’s future
and said that his party would provide better economic
management. Abbott, during his opening remarks, repeated that
the resources levy is a “bad tax.”  
 Abbott has said he’d scrap the tax if elected.
