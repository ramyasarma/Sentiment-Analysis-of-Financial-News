             Softbank Corp. probably marked
record operating profit of about 190 billion yen ($2.2 billion)
for April-June, an 80 percent increase from the same quarter a
year earlier, the Nikkei newspaper reported today. The mobile
phone service provider’s biggest single-quarter profit had been
136 billion yen for the October-December period of 2009, the
report said.  
 Softbank, the exclusive provider of Apple Inc.’s iPhone in
Japan, has benefited from rising popularity for the device, the
newspaper said.
