             Second-quarter earnings appear to
exceed 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion) at Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest bank, and its two closest
rivals, the Nikkei newspaper reported today. In addition to
increased profit from market-related operations, bad-loan losses
were limited as few large companies failed.  
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. had profit of about 150 billion
yen in the April-June period, reversing a loss of 4.4 billion
yen in the same quarter a year earlier, the newspaper said.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. saw as much as 200 billion
yen profit, up from 72.7 billion yen. Mitsubishi UFJ’s earnings
topped 100 billion yen, compared with 75.9 billion yen a year
earlier.
