             National Bank of Egypt, the
country’s largest lender, plans to sell its first international
bonds and is meeting with fixed-income investors, according to
three people familiar with the plan.  
 The Cairo-based bank may offer a benchmark-sized issue,
said a banker, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t yet set. A benchmark offering is usually $500 million or
more.  Citigroup Inc ., Morgan Stanley and  Deutsche Bank AG  are
organizing the meetings, according to the banker and an investor
attending the roadshow.  
 The lender received approval from Egypt’s central bank to
sell as much as $1.5 billion of bonds, said a bank official, who
declined to be identified. It is meeting investors in Asia, the
Middle East, London, Germany and in Eastern Europe, the official
said. The meetings will end on
July 31.  
 National Bank of Egypt is seeking to sell the bonds to
increase liquidity in foreign currencies and plans to use the
proceeds to finance major projects,  Al Alam Al Youm  newspaper
reported on May 30, without saying how it obtained the
information.
