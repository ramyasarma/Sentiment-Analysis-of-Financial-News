             Alberto Contador  is set to win
cycling’s Tour de France for a third time in four years after
entering today’s final stage with a 39-second lead over  Andy Schleck .  
 Spain’s Contador, of the Astana team, will be assured of
the title if the riders follow the usual protocol of not
competing for the race-leading yellow jersey during the trip
into Paris.  
 Luxembourg’s Schleck lost 31 seconds to his rival in
yesterday’s time trial and is set to finish runner-up to him for
the second straight year. He was forced to change his bike early
in today’s 102.5-kilometer (63.5-mile) stage.  
 Record seven-time champion Lance Armstrong’s RadioShack
team was made to switch jerseys before today’s stage, causing a
delay to the start.  
 Race organizers forced the team to swap into their usual
red jerseys after riders turned up at the start in a black
uniform promoting Armstrong’s cancer foundation.  
 Armstrong, 38, won the Tour de France, the sport’s most
prestigious event, each year from 1999 to 2005 after surviving
testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs.
