             Gasoline futures trading rose at the
fastest pace in more than four months as Tropical Storm Bonnie,
the second of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, threatened to
disrupt refineries in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 Open interest  for outstanding contracts on reformulated
gasoline on the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed 6 percent
in the week ended July 20, the most since March 16, as
speculators raised bets that prices will rise, according to the
weekly Commitments of Traders report from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. For  crude oil , open interest on the Nymex
fell 5.3 percent, the fastest rate in a month.  
 “Hurricane disruption this week might affect the product
market more than the crude market,” said  Antoine Halff , head of
energy research at Newedge USA LLC in New York. “There are
concerns about the fragility of the economic recovery.”  
 Bonnie, which formed last week, degenerated late July 24 to
a “disorganized area of low pressure” before reaching the Gulf
coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. The states
along the Gulf account for 43 percent of U.S. refining capacity
and 31 percent of the nation’s oil output, Energy Department
data show.  
 U.S. gasoline demand  in the four weeks ended July 16
climbed 0.5 percent to 9.36 million barrels a day, or about
16,000 less than the highest level since August 2008, according
to the Energy Department.  
 Gasoline for next month delivery gained 3.6 percent last
week to $2.1222 a gallon on the Nymex and  refinery utilization 
jumped to 91.5 percent in the week ended July 16, the highest
level since August 2007. Futures fell 1.22 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.11 at 9:30 a.m. today in New York.  
 Speculative Bets  
 Net-long positions  on gasoline by hedge funds and other
large investors jumped 7.1 percent to 28,906 for the week
through July 20, from 27,002 a week earlier, based on gasoline
futures and options trading on the Nymex, according to the CFTC.
Among producers and users, so-called  net short positions , or
bets that prices would fall, declined to 91,047, from 91,593.  
 Oil advanced 3.9 percent in New York last week. Investors
reduced open interest as hedge funds’ net-long positions in
crude futures and options on the Nymex rose by 11,197 to 95,652
for the seven days ended July 20, according to the CFTC data.  
 Open interest in oil has declined amid evidence the
economic recovery is faltering. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the outlook for the economy is
“unusually uncertain.”  
 Slowing Economy  
 The U.S. economy expanded at a slower pace in the second
quarter as consumer spending cooled and the trade deficit
swelled, economists project a report this week will show. Gross
domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual pace after
increasing at a 2.7 percent rate in the first three months of
the year, according to 68 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before a July 30 Commerce Department report.  
 Bets on U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude
slumped 13.2 percent in the 60 days through July 20 to the
lowest level since November, data from the Nymex and London’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange show. The last time open interest
fell more was the 13.7 percent decline over the similar period
through Oct. 7, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. filed for the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.  
 Front-month oil futures on the Nymex haven’t settled lower
than $68 a barrel or higher than $80 a barrel for the past 11
weeks. It was at $78.55 as of 10:51 a.m. London time.  
 “Last year, people were saying the recovery’s coming,”
said  Peter Beutel , president of trading adviser Cameron Hanover
Inc. in New Canaan, Connecticut. “Now, people are saying what
happened to the economic recovery? Why are prices not paying
attention to what’s going on in the economic recovery?”
