             Toyota Motor Corp. probably earned
second-quarter profit of about 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion),
compared with a loss of 195 billion yen a year earlier, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today. The automaker boosted sales in
developing nations and the Middle East, and weathered the impact
of a stronger yen, the newspaper said.
