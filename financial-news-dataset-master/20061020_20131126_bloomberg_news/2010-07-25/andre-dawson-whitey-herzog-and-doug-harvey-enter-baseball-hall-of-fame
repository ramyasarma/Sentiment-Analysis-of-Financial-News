             Andre Dawson  marked his induction
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame with a plea to young
players to avoid the mistakes, such as drug use, that have
tarnished baseball in recent years.  
 Dawson, an outfielder who was the 1987 National League Most
Valuable Player while with the Chicago Cubs, joined manager
 Whitey Herzog  and umpire  Doug Harvey  yesterday as the newest
members of the Cooperstown, New York-based Hall of Fame.  
 “Baseball will, from time to time, fall victim to the
mistakes that people make,” he said in his acceptance speech.
“Do not be lured to the dark side. It’s a stain on the game, a
stain gradually being removed.”  
 Dawson, 56, was the only player chosen this year to get a
plaque in Cooperstown’s museum. Dawson was voted in by the
Baseball Writers’ Association of America in January on his ninth
attempt.  
 “It is both humbling and overwhelming to see the men
sitting up here on this stage, thank you gentlemen for welcoming
this rookie to your team,” said Dawson, who was surrounded by
fellow Hall of Famers. “All I ever wanted to be when I was
growing up was to be like  Hank Aaron  and  Willie Mays , and now I
get to shake their hands.”  
 In 21 seasons in Major League Baseball, the man known as
“The Hawk” hit 438 home runs and stole 314 bases, and had a
career batting average of .279. He is one of six players to hit
at least 300 home runs and steal at least 300 bases. His
benchmark season came in 1987, when he set career marks with 49
homers and 137 runs batted in, capturing the MVP award in his
first season in Chicago even though the Cubs finished in last
place.  
 Rookie of Year  
 In Dawson’s first full season in the majors, he won the
Rookie of the Year award in 1977 with the Expos, for whom he
played his first 11 seasons. Dawson moved as a free agent to the
Cubs for the next six seasons after lobbying Chicago to sign
him.  
 Dawson’s contract was worth $500,000, plus $250,000 in
incentives, which he accomplished. After finishing his stint
with the Cubs, Dawson played the next two years with Boston, and
closed out his career in Florida, retiring at the age of 41 in
1996. Dawson never made it to the World Series during his
career.  
 “I didn’t play this game with this goal in my mind,” he
said, “but I’m living proof that if you love this game, this
game will love you back.”  
 Herzog, a six-time division champion as manager of the
Kansas City Royals and St. Louis Cardinals, and Harvey were
elected by the Hall of Fame’s veterans committee.  
 “Being elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame is
like going to heaven before you die,” Herzog said in his
acceptance speech.  
 Signed by Yankees  
 Herzog, 78, was signed by the New York Yankees in 1949 as a
player and spent eight seasons with four teams. He also was a
coach, scout and general manager. He had a 1,281-1,125 career
record as a manager, won three pennants and a World Series title
and became the 19th manager elected to the Hall of Fame.  
 Herzog’s managing career began in 1973 with the Texas
Rangers, and he managed four games on an interim basis for the
California Angels the following year. He spent 1975-1979 with
the Royals, where he won three straight American League West
division titles. He moved on to St. Louis in 1980 and stayed
until 1990. Herzog won his only World Series in 1982, and also
led the Cardinals to National League pennants in 1985 and 1987.  
 In his speech, Herzog paid tribute to fellow Hall of Fame
manager  Casey Stengel  and said he learned many lessons from the
man who managed the New York Yankees in 1949-1960 and the New
York Mets in 1962-1965.  
 “Instead of thinking about girls at night, I was trying to
figure out what he was talking about,” Herzog said with a
laugh.  
 Harvey Nicknamed ‘God’  
 Harvey, 80, a major league umpire from 1962-1992, was
nicknamed “God” by players due to his focus on the rules. He
umpired in five World Series, and nine NL Championship Series.  
 Though Harvey was at the ceremony, his speech was recorded
in advance because he is suffering from throat cancer.  
 “I want to congratulate and acknowledge every umpire from
Little League to the major leagues,” said Harvey, the ninth
umpire inducted into the Hall of Fame. “This is our day, and
I’m standing here representing you.”
