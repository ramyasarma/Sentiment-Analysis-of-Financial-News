             Richard Branson ’s Virgin Active, the
 Virgin Group Ltd.  fitness-center unit, was approached by
private-equity firms as it seeks to raise money for
acquisitions, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.  
 Negotiations are at an early stage following inquiries from
the potential suitors about Virgin Active’s growth plans,
according to the person, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. Virgin is interested in consolidating the
market and such a deal would help boost its ability to do so,
the person said.  
 The Sunday Telegraph reported that the health and fitness
chain has held talks with private-equity companies about
a potential deal that could net more than 1 billion pounds
($1.54 billion). KKR & Co., Blackstone Group LP, Advent
International Corp. and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. may be
interested, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 Virgin Active has 170 health and fitness clubs worldwide
with more than 900,000 members, according to its  website .
