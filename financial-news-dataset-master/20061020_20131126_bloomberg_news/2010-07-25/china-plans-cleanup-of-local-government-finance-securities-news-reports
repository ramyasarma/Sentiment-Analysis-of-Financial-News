             China’s central government plans to
issue rules for the “cleanup” of local government financing
vehicles, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  
 The National Development and Reform Commission, the
Ministry of Finance, the People’s Bank of China and the China
Banking Regulatory Commission plan to jointly issue the rules,
the Shanghai-based newspaper reported. Local governments will
have to submit reports by the end of this year on how they’ve
strengthened management of their finacing vehicles, according to
the report.  
 Financing vehicles that rely on fiscal government funds to
repay loans will no longer be allowed to borrow, the newspaper
reported. Local rail transport projects will be allowed to
continue borrowing, according to the report.
