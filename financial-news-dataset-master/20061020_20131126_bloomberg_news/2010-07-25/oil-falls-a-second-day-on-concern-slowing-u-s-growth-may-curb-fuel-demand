             Oil gained, trading above $79 a
barrel for a third day in New York, as advancing equities in
Asia bolstered speculation the global recovery in fuel demand
will be sustained.  
 Crude rose as the MSCI Asia Pacific Index reached a one-
month high after most European banks passed stress tests aimed
at assuring investors. Consumer spending, which accounts for
about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, the world’s largest,
 probably increased  last quarter, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before a report this week.  
 “The market is on the way to test $80 and the stock market
is one of the factors,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-
derivatives sales manager at broker Newedge Group in Tokyo.
“After the result of the stress tests, we have to continue to
monitor the financial markets. Even on Friday, the markets
sustained gains.”  
 Oil for September delivery rose as much as 33 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $79.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $79.21 at 2:52 p.m.
Singapore time. On July 23, the contract fell 32 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $78.98 after settling at $79.30 on July 22, the
highest since May 5. Futures have gained 16 percent in the past
year.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 0.4 percent to 117.92
as of 3:17 p.m. in Tokyo amid optimism over the health of the
global economy. Finance companies were the biggest boost to the
index, set for the highest close since June 22.  
 Bonnie Dissipates  
 Oil declined as much as 0.4 percent earlier today after
Bonnie dissipated as a tropical storm near the U.S. Gulf Coast
at the weekend, sparing refineries and offshore production
operations. BP Plc vessels returned to the area working to
permanently plug a damaged well, the source of the largest oil
spill in U.S. history.  
 The U.S. economy probably expanded at a slower pace in the
second quarter as the trade deficit swelled, economists said
before reports this week.  
 Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annual pace
after increasing at a 2.7 percent rate in the first three months
of the year, according to the median estimate of 68 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a July 30 Commerce Department
report. Other data may show gains in business investment took up
some of the slack and housing remained in a slump.  
 “It’s still a case of U.S. demand not being particularly
strong and that’s a reflection really of a pretty tepid U.S.
economic recovery,” said  Toby Hassall , a commodity analyst at
CWA Global Markets Pty in Sydney. “The market also seems to
have removed some of that weather premium that had been built in
response to the threat posed with Bonnie.”  
 Speculators  
 Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their  net-long position  in New York crude futures to a three-
week high, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, outnumbered short positions by 36,145 contracts in the
week ended July 20, up 4.3 percent from a week earlier.  
 Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange rose as much as 46 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $77.91 a barrel. It was at $77.78 at 2:51 p.m.
Singapore time. On July 23, the contract dropped 37 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $77.45.
