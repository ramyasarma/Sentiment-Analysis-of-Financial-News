             An Al-Qaeda-linked gang in the
Sahara desert has killed a 78-year-old French hostage in
retaliation for the killing of six of its members in a failed
Mauritanian-French rescue raid, Agence France-Presse reported,
citing an audio statement broadcast by Al-Jazeera.  
 France has received no confirmation of the death of Michel
Germaneau and President Nicolas Sarkozy will hold a crisis
meeting of his inner cabinet today, AFP reported.
