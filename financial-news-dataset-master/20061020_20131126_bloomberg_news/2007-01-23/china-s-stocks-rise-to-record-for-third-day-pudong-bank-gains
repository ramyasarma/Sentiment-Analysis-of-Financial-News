             China 's stocks rose, pushing the
benchmark to a record for a third day. Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank Co. led lenders higher after it won regulatory
approval to set up a fund-management arm.  
 ``The conglomeration of China's financial industry, which
will let banks, insurers and brokers expand into each other's
business, is most likely to benefit banks,'' said Liu Xiaochang,
a bank analyst at Huatai Securities Co. in Nanjing.  
 The  Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index , which tracks yuan-
denominated A shares listed on China's two exchanges, gained
16.82, or 0.7 percent, to a record 2508.13 at the close, after
earlier dropping as much as 3.1 percent. The measure has surged
8.6 percent in four sessions.  
 The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China's stock exchanges, rose 0.5 percent to 2949.14. The
Shenzhen Composite Index, which covers the smaller one, added
0.3 percent to 702.09.  
 Pudong Bank (600000) , the Chinese partner of Citigroup Inc., surged
2.26 yuan, or the 10 percent daily limit, to 24.85. The lender
said it won approval from China's banking regulator to start a
fund with French insurer Axa SA. Pudong Bank will own 51 percent
of the venture, it said.  
 China has allowed domestic lenders to set up funds with
overseas investors since February 2005, to develop capital
markets and provide another income source for banks, which get
as much as 90 percent of their earnings from interest spreads.  
 China Merchants Bank Co., the nation's third-biggest
publicly traded lender, rose 1.28  yuan , or 7.3 percent, to 18.81.
China Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation's first privately
controlled lender, jumped 1.04 yuan, or 10 percent, to 11.41.  
 Steelmakers Gain  
 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., China's biggest steelmaker,
gained 0.58 yuan, or 6.4 percent, to 9.70. The stock trades at
13 times earnings per share, compared with 37 times for the 300
index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 ``The steel sector is relatively under-valued in the
market,'' said Zheng Dong, a Beijing-based steel analyst at
Guosen Securities Co. ``Investors have realized this is a good
opportunity to buy steel stocks.''  
 Wuhan Iron & Steel Co., the third biggest, advanced 0.67
yuan, or 8.7 percent, to 8.34. The shares trade at 14 times
expected earnings.  Angang Steel Co. (000898) , the No. 4, added 0.72 yuan,
or 5.5 percent, to 13.78. The company was rated
``neutral/neutral'' in new coverage by Song Shen, a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  
 Xinjiang Ba Yi Iron & Steel Co. (600581) , a Xinjiang-based
steelmaker, climbed 0.14 yuan, or 2.4 percent, to 6.10. The
company said the board approved its plan to borrow 1.2 billion
yuan ($154.3 million) from a bank to finance the purchase of
fixed assets.  
 `Get Out'  
 China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)  gained after shareholders
approved a plan to buy out subsidiaries.  
 China Petroleum, Asia's biggest oil refiner, also known as
Sinopec, advanced 0.33 yuan, or 3.5 percent, to 9.73. The
company said its shareholders yesterday approved a plan to issue
as much as $1.3 billion worth of convertible bonds to fund a
buyout of its units.  
 Shareholders also approved a plan to sell 10 billion yuan
of bonds in mainland China to fund the construction of chemical
projects, it said.  
 Some of the most valuable companies such as China Vanke Co.
and Suning Appliance Co. declined as investors judged recent
gains excessive.  
 ``As the market rises, investor psychology changes and some
will decide to get out,'' said Wu Jianfei, who manages about
$438 million with CCB Principal Asset management Co. in Beijing.
``The market is supported by the fundamentals, but I do
recognize that it operates on differences in perception.''  
 Relative Strength Index  
 Vanke, the nation's biggest property developer, slid 0.37
yuan, or 2.1 percent, to 16.93. Suning Appliance, China's
second-biggest home appliance retailer, fell 4.01 yuan, or 5.7
percent, to 66.78. Kweichow Moutai Co., the maker of Moutai, the
fiery liquor used at official banquets, fell 7.92 yuan, or 7
percent, to 105.28.  
 The 14-day relative strength measure for the 300 index, a
moving average based on whether the gauge rose or fell, was at
82.3 yesterday. A reading above 70 signals to some investors the
index is poised for a fall.
