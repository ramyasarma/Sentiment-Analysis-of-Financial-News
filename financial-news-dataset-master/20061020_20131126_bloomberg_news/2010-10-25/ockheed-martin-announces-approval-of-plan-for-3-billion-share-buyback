Lockheed Martin Corp. , the world’s
largest defense company, said its board approved a share buyback
program of as much as $3 billion to return money to investors.  “We remain committed to returning at least 50 percent of
annual free cash to stockholders through  dividends  and share
repurchases,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Robert Stevens  said in a statement. The company boosted its quarterly
dividend by 19 percent to 75 cents last month.  Lockheed said this month that it plans to report $3.4
billion in cash from operations this year. The Bethesda,
Maryland-based company said it had bought back 19.8 million
shares for $1.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2010.  The defense company said it had about 360 million shares of
common stock outstanding on Sept. 26.  Lockheed dropped 37 cents to $71.41 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have  declined  5.2
percent this year.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
