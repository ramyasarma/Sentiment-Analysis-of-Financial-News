U.K.  mortgage  approvals fell in
September to the lowest level since March 2009 because of weaker
demand for homes, the British Bankers’ Association said.  Lenders granted 31,104 home loans, compared with 31,781 in
August, the group, which represents U.K. banks, said today in an
e-mailed statement in London.  “Demand for new mortgages remains low despite more
properties on the market and falling house prices,”  David Dooks , director of statistics at the BBA, said in the statement.
It’s a “reflection of household uncertainties” ahead of the
government’s spending review which was announced last week.  A survey by Rightmove Plc showed today that the number of
Britons who expect house prices to fall outnumbered those
forecasting an increase for the first time since 2009. The drop
in confidence in the property market comes as Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  prepares to implement cuts to shrink
the  budget deficit  that may lead to the loss of half a million
public-sector jobs.  The BBA report also said that consumer spending remains
“subdued” and demand for unsecured credit contracted by 1.6
percent in the year through September. Personal deposits rose
4.6 percent in that period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
