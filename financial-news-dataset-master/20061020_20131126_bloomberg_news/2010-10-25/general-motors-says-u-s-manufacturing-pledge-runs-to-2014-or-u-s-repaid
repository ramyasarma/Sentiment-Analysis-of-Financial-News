General Motors Co. said its pledge
to maintain certain levels of vehicle production in the U.S.
remains in effect until the U.S. has recovered all $49.5 billion
invested in the Detroit-based automaker.  GM had proposed making 1.8 million cars and trucks in the
U.S. this year with output rising to 2.26 million in 2014. It
pledges to make at least 90 percent as many vehicles in the U.S.
as planned as long as it is commercially reasonable.  The repayment condition was added to GM’s registration
statement for an initial stock offering in an amendment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
