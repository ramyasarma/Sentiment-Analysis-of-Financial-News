UBS AG, Switzerland’s biggest bank,
hired  Brett Langbert  as a managing director and team leader for
its prime brokerage business in the U.S.  Langbert will be based in New York and will report to  Jon Yalmokas , who leads U.S. prime brokerage sales, Zurich-based UBS
said in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by spokeswoman  Kelly Smith .  At Morgan Stanley, Langbert was an equities managing
director in charge of a model for multi-strategy and cross-asset
class hedge funds. Before that he worked at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. as head of volatility products for middle market clients.  “Brett’s multi-product experience and diverse client
relationships will help us to continue to develop our client
focus into a wider strategy set,” Yalmokas and  Stuart Hendel ,
co-head of global prime services, said in the statement.  Prime brokerages provide services such as cash and
securities lending, custody, introduction to potential investors
and startup consulting services to hedge funds. Yalmokas was
named to lead UBS’s U.S. prime brokerage unit in January. Hendel
took over as UBS’s global head of prime brokerage in July after
holding the same position at Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
