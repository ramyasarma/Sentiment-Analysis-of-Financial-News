Money manager  Kenneth Starr , who
pleaded guilty in September in a $59 million fraud case, was
sued by  Bank of America Corp.  over an unpaid $500,000 debt.  Bank of America NA, a unit of the  largest U.S. bank  by
assets, filed the lawsuit in New York state court in Manhattan
on Oct. 21. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank named the
money manager’s firm, Starr Investment Advisors LLC, as a co-
defendant.  “There is now immediately due and owing to the bank,” the
principal sum of $500,000, plus accrued interest and late fees
of about $12,000 through the filing date, according to the
complaint.  Starr, 66, pleaded guilty on Sept. 10 to three criminal
counts before U.S. Magistrate Judge  Theodore Katz  in Manhattan.
Starr, whose firm’s clients included heiress Rachel “Bunny”
Mellon and actors  Sylvester Stallone  and  Wesley Snipes , told the
court he had stolen as much as $50 million.  He had faced 20 counts of wire fraud and one each of
securities fraud, money laundering and fraud by an investment
adviser. No sentencing date has been set.  Bank of America alleges Starr had guaranteed the revolving
line of credit extended to his firm in March and upon which it
defaulted in June. Starr was indicted by a federal grand jury on
June 10.  Flora Edwards , Starr’s criminal defense attorney, didn’t
immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment after
regular business hours.  Starr was sued in June in the same court by Los Angeles-
based City National Bank, which last month won a default
judgment in the amount of $2.6 million that it claimed was owed
on a promissory note executed in February.  The case is Bank of America NA v. Starr Investment Advisors
LLC, 651826-2010, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). The
criminal case is U.S. v. Starr, 10-cr-00520, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  -- With assistance from Karen Freifeld, Bob Van Voris and
