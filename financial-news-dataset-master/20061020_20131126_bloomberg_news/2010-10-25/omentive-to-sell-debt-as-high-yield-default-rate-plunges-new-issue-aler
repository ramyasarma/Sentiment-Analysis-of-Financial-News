notes and Albany, New York-based Momentive Performance Materials

about 1 percent by the end of 2010 as companies take advantage
of the lowest borrowing costs in more than three years to
refinance their debt, according to an Oct. 20 report by Fitch
Ratings.  “By replacing loans with longer-debt bonds, companies are
pushing out debt maturities overall,” said  Mariarosa Verde , a
managing director at Fitch. “It is beneficial from the point of
view of putting downward pressure on default rates.”  The high-yield default rate for the 12 months through
September was 3.5 percent, Fitch said, down from 4.5 percent at
the end of June and 13.7 percent at the end of last year.  Companies have sold $224.4 billion of junk bonds this year,
the most on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Debt maturing in 2016 or later accounts for 87 percent of new
issues this year, while bonds due in 2018 or later make up 65
percent, the Fitch report said.  Spreads, Yields Decline  The extra yield investors demand to own high-yield bonds
fell 4 basis points to 596 basis points on Oct. 25 while yields

Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Momentive Performance Materials and Momentive Specialty
Chemicals each plan to use proceeds from their sales to repay
