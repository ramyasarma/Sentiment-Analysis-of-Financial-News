Brazil may adopt additional measures
to curb foreign capital inflows if steps already taken aren’t
effective, central bank Director Anthero Meirelles said.  “Other measures may be taken, but first we need to
carefully observe what happens,” Meirelles said in an interview
while attending a Uruguayan central bank event in Montevideo.  “It’s difficult to announce in advance another measure
because the process is very dynamic,” said Meirelles. “We need
to observe the result of the measures already taken and watch
the evolution of the global discussion over the current moment
of great liquidity and large international capital flows.”  Meirelles, the director of administration at the central
bank, said Brazil is “very optimistic” about steps taken by
the Group of 20 over the weekend to produce stronger, more
balanced global economic growth.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
