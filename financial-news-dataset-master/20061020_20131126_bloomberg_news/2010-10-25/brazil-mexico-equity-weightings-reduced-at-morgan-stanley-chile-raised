Morgan Stanley cut Latin America’s
rating to “underweight” in the brokerage’s global emerging
markets model portfolio and raised Asia to “overweight.”  Latin America “tends to underperform during corrective
phases,”  Jonathan Garner , Morgan Stanley’s Hong Kong-based chief
Asian and emerging-market strategist, said in a report today.
“The main factors driving these changes are relative weaknesses
in earnings growth and revision factors for Brazil and Mexico.”  Morgan Stanley lowered its recommended weighting for Brazil
to “equal-weight” from “overweight” and Mexico to “underweight”
from “equal-weight,” while Chile was upgraded to “equal-weight.”
Asia’s rating was increased as the brokerage raised China’s
allocation, the report said.  Brazil’s  Bovespa Index  had its first weekly decline since
August last week, on concern higher interest rates in China and
uncertainty in global currency markets will curb economic growth.
Analysts have cut their 2010 earnings per share estimates for
Brazil’s companies to 17 percent from 29 percent in June, and
lowered Mexico’s to 8 percent from 17 percent, the report said.  Morgan Stanley increased its “overweight” position on China
to 350 basis points from 225 basis points and reduced both its
Korea and Russia “overweight” ratings by 50 basis points to 125
because China’s domestic growth is re-accelerating at the same
time as “early signs” emerge of a global trade slowdown, the
report said.  -- Chua Kong Ho  in Shanghai. Editors:  Richard Frost ,  Reinie Booysen   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
