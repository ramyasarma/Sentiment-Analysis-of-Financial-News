Colombia’s peso fell for a third day
after President  Juan Manuel Santos  said the South American
country will take measures this week to ease the peso’s rally.  Colombia has been studying measures “carefully” given the
“complicated” situation, Santos said Oct. 23, according to
comments posted on the  presidential website .  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,829.65 per dollar at 9:17
a.m. New York time, from 1,828.65 on Oct. 22. Today’s decline
pared the peso’s jump this year to 11.7 percent, the best
performance among six major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
