John Farrell  will replace  Cito Gaston  as manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, the Major League
Baseball team announced in a statement.  Farrell, 48, was pitching coach with the Boston Red Sox for
the past four seasons. He was introduced today as the 12th
manager in the Blue Jays’ 34-year history.  Farrell played eight seasons as a starting pitcher for the
Cleveland Indians, California Angels and Detroit Tigers from
1987-1996. He was director of player operations for the Indians
for six seasons before joining the Red Sox organization, where
he coached Red Sox pitchers to a league-best 3.87 earned run
average and a World Series title in 2007. This is his first
managerial job.  Gaston, 66, retired in September after leading the Blue
Jays for two and a half seasons, his second stint with the team.
Gaston also managed the Blue Jays from 1989-1997, when he won
World Series titles in 1992 and 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
