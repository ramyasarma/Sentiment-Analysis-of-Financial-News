Cocoa rose to a two-month high on
the dollar’s slump and concerns that supplies from Ivory Coast
may be disrupted. Sugar, coffee and orange-juice futures also
gained.  The greenback fell as much as 1 percent against a basket of
major currencies, bolstering the appeal of commodities as
alternative investments. Elections that have been delayed since
2005 in Ivory Coast, the world’s largest cocoa grower, are
scheduled for Oct. 31.  “The weaker dollar is helping most commodities,” and
apprehension on the Ivorian vote “is keeping sellers away,”
said  Sterling Smith , an analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in St.
Paul, Minnesota.  Cocoa for December delivery rose $84, or 3 percent, to
settle at $2,930 a metric ton at 11:57 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. Earlier, the price reached $2,937, the highest
level for a most-active contract since Aug. 11.  In London, cocoa futures for December delivery advanced 38
pounds, or 2 percent, to close at 1,963 pounds ($3,092) a ton on
NYSE Liffe.  Ivory Coast remains divided into a government-controlled
south and rebel-held north following a military mutiny and civil
conflict in 2002.  Sugar, Coffee Rally  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 0.28 cent, or 1
percent, to settle at 28.5 cents a pound in New York.  In London, refined-sugar futures for December delivery
gained $10.30, or 1.5 percent, to $717.20 a ton.  Production in Australia, the world’s third-largest
exporter, probably will trail estimates earlier this month as
record rainfall disrupts the harvest, a group of producers said.  Coffee advanced on concern that adverse weather in
producing nations will curb supplies.  Exporters in Vietnam, the world’s biggest grower of robusta
beans, may slow shipments as rain in the central highlands
increase concern that the crop may be delayed, traders said last
week.  Brazil, the largest producer, may harvest about 36 million
bags next year, down from 47.2 million this year and 39.5
million in 2009 after a drought hindered crop flowering, the
National Coffee Council said last week. A bag weighs 60
kilograms (132 pounds).  Robusta, used in instant coffee, is harvested mostly in
Asia and parts of Africa. Arabica is grown mainly in Latin
America and brewed by specialty companies including Starbucks
Corp.  ‘All About Weather’  “It’s all about the weather in Vietnam and Southeast
Asia,” said  Carsten Fritsch , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Commerzbank AG. The arabica market is focused on “small
downward divisions in Colombia and Central America,” he said.  In London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery
climbed $37, or 2 percent, to $1,863 a ton.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery rose 1.65
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.005 a pound in New York.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery rose 1.55 cents,
or 1 percent, to $1.4945 a pound. The price has climbed 16
percent in 2010.  The dollar’s decline is adding “positive sentiment for all
commodity markets,” Fritsch said. “As long as financial
markets provide a tailwind, these elevated price levels may
continue.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
