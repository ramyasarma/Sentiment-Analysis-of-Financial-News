New York Yankees pitching coach  Dave Eiland  will not return next season following the team’s playoff
exit at the hands of the Texas Rangers.  Eiland’s release was announced today by Yankees General
Manager  Brian Cashman  at a news conference.  “He’s not being blamed for what took place,” Cashman
said, according to the New York Daily News. “He’s a terrific
pitching coach and he should have no problem getting a job.”  The Yankees’ 4.06 earned run average this season was 15th
among Major League Baseball’s 30 franchises.  Eiland, 44, became the New York’s pitching coach in 2007
after coaching five seasons elsewhere in the Yankees’
organization.  He played parts of five seasons with the Yankees from
1988-91 and in 1995, starting 70 games during his 10-year major-
league career. He had a 12-27 record and a 5.74 ERA.  Cashman also announced that he’ll meet tomorrow with the
agent of manager  Joe Girardi , who is unsigned after three
seasons with the club, and that he expects free-agent  Derek Jeter , the team’s 36-year-old captain, to be back next year.  “There’s still game left in that guy,” Cashman said about
Jeter. “He’s going to be part of this franchise. We’ll work
something out we’re both comfortable with.”  The Yankees finished in second place in the American League
East with a 95-67 record, sweeping the Minnesota Twins to open
the playoff before falling in six games to the Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
