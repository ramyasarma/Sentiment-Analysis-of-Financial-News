The ruling Democratic Party of
Japan’s tax panel recommended a reduction in aviation fuel tax
as part of its fiscal 2011 reform proposals, Nikkei English News
said, without citing anyone.   The panel decided not to include a proposal to increase
tobacco tax, the report said. The panel may submit the
recommendations to the government early next month, the report
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
