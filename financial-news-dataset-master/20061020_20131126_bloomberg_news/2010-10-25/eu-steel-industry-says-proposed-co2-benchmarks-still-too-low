The European Steel industry said
draft carbon-intensity benchmarks for allocating free allowances
in the European Union emissions program from 2013 were too
strict even after an adjustment in internal EU consultations.   “The benchmarks for steel are still too low because they
do not take account of the full CO2 in waste gases used for
electricity production, as is provided for by the directive,”
Axel Eggert, a Eurofer spokesman, said by phone. “They are
still below the best performer according to our calculations
based on independently verified data.”  The benchmarks, based on the average performance of the top
10 percentile of installations in 2007-2008, will help determine
how many permits emitters get for free when the EU moves toward
auctioning of allowances in the eight-year phase of its carbon-
trading program through 2020.  The average amount of allowances that will be allocated to
so-called hot metals factories will be 1.328 metric tons of free
CO2 allowances for each ton of product, 25 percent more than in
an earlier draft, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “According to our calculations the benchmark for hot metal
should be 1.475 allowances per ton,” Eggert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
