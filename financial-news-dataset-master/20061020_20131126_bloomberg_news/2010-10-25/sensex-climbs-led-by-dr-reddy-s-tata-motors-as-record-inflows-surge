India’s stock rose, driving the
benchmark index to its highest in more than a week, as foreign
investors increased holdings of local shares amid expectations a
growing economy will boost corporate earnings.  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. , the nation’s second-biggest
drugmaker by revenue, rose to the highest in at least 19 years
after second-quarter group profit jumped 32 percent. Global
funds became net buyers of Indian stocks for a 37th trading day,
the longest run of inflows in more than five years.  Tata Motors
Ltd. , the biggest truckmaker, also reached a 19-year high as
Chief Executive Officer  Carl-Peter Forster  said the Jaguar Land
Rover unit is in talks with a possible partner in China.  “We are bullish,” said  Vaibhav Sanghavi , a fund manager
at Ambit Capital Ltd. in Mumbai. “The money flowing into our
stocks is phenomenal; and it will continue to rise. The quality
of earnings has been satisfactory so far.” Sanghavi said he’s
adding shares of companies related to domestic consumption,
without naming any.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 137.26, or 0.7 percent, to 20,303.12 as of the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The S&P CNX  Nifty  Index on the National Stock
Exchange rose 0.7 percent to 6,105.80. The  BSE 200 Index 
increased 0.6 percent to 2,582.87.  Dr. Reddy’s gained 1.8 percent to 1,638.6 rupees. Tata
Motors increased 3.2 percent to 1,185.65 rupees. Both stocks
closed at the highest level since at least January 1991.  Hindustan Unilever  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , the biggest household products
maker, rose 1.7 percent to 306.3 rupees. The company’s second-
quarter profit surged 32 percent to 5.66 billion rupees ($128
million), topping the mean 5.2 billion-rupee estimate among 24
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Reliance Industries Ltd. , the
most valuable company in India, climbed 0.8 percent to 1,090.35
rupees.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. , the largest copper and
zinc producer, soared 2.6 percent to 172.55 rupees.  Hindalco
Industries Ltd. , the biggest aluminum producer, surged 4.4
percent to 221.2 rupees, its highest since at least since
January 1991. Metals producers climbed as industrial metals
rallied on demand from investors seeking to protect their wealth
against a decline in the dollar. Copper advanced toward a 27-
month high, while zinc and lead rose to their highest level
since January.  India’s stocks, the best performers this year among the
world’s 10 biggest markets, will extend gains amid the “biggest
wealth transfer in history” from developed-nation equities,
according to the country’s largest money manager.  Growing Economy  “The Indian economy is going to quadruple in the next 10
to 12 years and money will find its way” in, said  Sunil Singhania , head of equities at Reliance Capital Asset Management
Ltd., which manages $32 billion in assets. “You have one bloc
that is growing at 6 percent with an appreciating currency and
the other struggling to grow at 2 percent with a depreciating
currency.”  Emerging-market stock mutual  funds  attracted more than $60
billion this year as benchmark interest rates near zero percent
in the U.S. and Japan lifted demand for higher-yielding assets,
data compiled by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm
EPFR Global show. U.S. stock funds had outflows of $71 billion,
according to Investment Company Institute data.  “Demographics are in favor of India,” Singhania, 43,
whose  Reliance Growth Fund  is India’s best performer over the
past decade, said in an interview in Goa, India on Oct. 23.
“Whenever a person ages, the business and wealth gets
transferred to the younger generation. If you take the world as
a family, the same thing is going to happen.”  Drugmakers  Singhania is betting on shares of drugmakers, capital goods
and infrastructure companies to beat the benchmark indexes,
declining to name specific shares.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  9.77 billion rupees  of
Indian equities on Oct. 21, extending this year’s record inflows
to 1.1 trillion rupees, according to the nation’s market
regulator. The 37th day of net purchases was the longest run of
inflows since the 40-day period ended Aug. 9, 2005, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
