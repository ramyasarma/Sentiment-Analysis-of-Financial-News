Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc.  is
unlikely to sell itself after a five-month auction process,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  and Novartis AG both looked at
acquiring Savient and passed because of concern about price,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks
are private. Savient’s advisers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Lazard Ltd. have determined that a deal is not happening, one of
the people said.  Savient said in May that it would pursue a sale if it won
U.S. approval for its gout treatment Krystexxa, which came Sept.
14. Americans with chronic gout may pay tens of thousands of
dollars a year for a biologic treatment that works when other
drugs don’t. Savient’s current market value is $1.4 billion.  Shares of Savient dropped 7.6 percent, or $1.65, to $20.05
today before Nasdaq Stock Market trading was halted. The  stock 
climbed 59 percent in 2010 before today as investors anticipated
clearance of the gout drug and a possible sale.  Mary Coleman , a spokeswoman for Savient, based in East
Brunswick, New Jersey, and  Eric Althoff , a spokesman for
Novartis in Basel, Switzerland, didn’t immediately return calls
for comment. Jennifer Fron Mauer, spokewoman for New York-based
Bristol-Myers, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
