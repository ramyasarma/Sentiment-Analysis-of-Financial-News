Soybeans climbed to a 16-month high
and corn rose on speculation that increasing Chinese demand for
animal feed will boost sales of supplies from the U.S., the
biggest grower and exporter.  U.S. shippers reported sales of 232,000 metric tons of
soybeans to China, the Department of Agriculture said today. The
Asian nation imported a record 40.16 million tons in the first
nine months of 2010, the Customs General Administration said
today. Corn imports surged to 512,800 tons in September, up from
7,260 a year earlier. Dalian Commodity Exchange corn futures
rose to a record today.  “Chinese demand for soybeans remains elevated” because of
rising animal feed demand, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst
for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. “Record prices in China
signal they will be buying more U.S. corn.”  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 14 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $12.255 a bushels at 10:03 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price reached $12.355, the highest price
for a most-active contract since June 5, 2009. Before today, the
commodity grained 9.5 percent this month, heading for a fourth
straight monthly gain.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 8 cents, or 14
percent, to $5.68 a bushel on the CBOT, the first gain in three
sessions. The grain fell 0.5 percent last week, after surging 21
percent in the previous two weeks. On Oct. 13, the price reached
$5.88, the highest level for a most-active contract since August
2008.  In the week ended Oct. 14, U.S. soybean  sales  surged 85
percent to 2.02 million tons from a week earlier, according to
the USDA. About 72 percent of the total went to China. Since
then, exporters reported sales of 1.61 million tons to China or
unknown destinations, USDA data show.  Before today, Chinese  profit margins  on crushing soybeans
surged 79 percent in the past year as livestock-feed demand
rose, according to data from Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd.  The soybean crop in the U.S. was valued at $31.8 billion
last year, second only to corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
