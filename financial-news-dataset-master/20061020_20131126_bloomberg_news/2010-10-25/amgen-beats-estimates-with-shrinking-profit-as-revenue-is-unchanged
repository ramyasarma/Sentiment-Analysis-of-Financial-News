Amgen Inc. , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, said third-quarter profit fell 11 percent
as sales dropped for three top products. Revenue from its new
bone drug missed analysts’ estimates, pushing down shares.  Net income decreased to $1.24 billion, or $1.28 a share,
from $1.39 billion, or $1.36 a share, a year earlier, the
Thousand Oaks, California-based company said in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was $1.36 a share, beating the
$1.27 average  estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Combined revenue from the anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen
has declined for four years and sales of a top-seller, the
rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, fell this quarter. Investors
are waiting to see if denosumab, cleared in June in the U.S. and
Europe for osteoporosis, will show in a study later this year
that it also stops prostate cancer from spreading to bones.  “At this point, this is really a denosumab in cancer
story,” said  Yaron Werber , an analyst for Citigroup in New York
said in a telephone interview today. “That’s what everybody is
waiting for.”  Third-quarter sales for Prolia, the name Amgen uses for
denosumab in osteoporosis, were $10 million, below the $31
million expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Analysts
expect denosumab to reach $2.2 billion in sales in 2013.  ‘Growth Story’  With strong data showing that denosumab can stop cancer
from spreading to bones, “Amgen becomes a growth story again,”
said  Jim Birchenough , an analyst for Barclay’s Capital in San
Francisco, in an Oct. 20 telephone interview.  U.S. regulators are also scheduled to decide Nov. 18
whether to approve denosumab for use in reducing fractures in
patients who already have cancer in their bones. That too may
boost revenue as well as the shares, which Birchenough considers
underpriced. He rates Amgen “overweight” and has a 12-month
target price of $71.  Amgen fell 40 cents, or less than a percent, to $57.55 at
5:46 p.m. in extended trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
stock has gained 3.2 percent in the past 12 months.  Neulasta, used to boost infection-fighting cells in
patients getting chemotherapy, rose to $916 million from $871
million a year ago. Sales of Enbrel fell to $914 million from
$924 million a year ago. Combined sales of the anemia drugs
Aranesp and Epogen dropped to $1.28 billion from $1.35 billion.
It was the seventh decline in the last eight quarters for
Aranesp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
