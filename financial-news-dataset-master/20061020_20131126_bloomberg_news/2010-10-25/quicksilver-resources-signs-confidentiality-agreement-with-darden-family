Quicksilver Resources Inc.,  the
natural-gas and oil producer weighing a potential offer from the
Darden family to go private, entered a confidentiality agreement
with members of the family.  The family will get non-public information in exchange for
agreeing not to buy additional shares for the next six months
without approval of the company’s transaction committee, Fort
Worth, Texas-based Quicksilver said in a statement today.  Quicksilver’s board doesn’t intend to waive certain
provisions of its shareholder rights plan, as requested by the
investor group, the company said today. The Darden family holds
three of seven seats on Quicksilver’s  board .  Quicksilver jumped 16 percent to $14.65 a share on Oct. 18
after the company said Darden-controlled Quicksilver Energy LP
was proposing a potential buyout that would include SPO Partners
& Co. Together those entities  hold  39 percent of the company,
according to filings.  Quicksilver fell 3 cents to $15.17 at 4:01 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have risen 1.1
percent this year.  Before the potential takeover was announced, the shares had
fallen 16 percent this year, making Quicksilver the second-worst
performer in the eight-company  Standard & Poor’s Midcap Oil &
Gas Exploration & Production Index , ahead of Comstock Resources
Inc.  Quicksilver went public 11 years ago after operating for
more than three decades as a private company, most recently
known as Mercury Exploration, run by the Darden family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
