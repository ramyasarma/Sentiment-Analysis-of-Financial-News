Corn rose in South Africa, the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, tracking a jump
in Chicago prices on speculation that the dollar’s drop may
bolster demand for U.S. crops.  Corn for December delivery rose 2.4 percent to $5.7325 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, rose 6 rand, or 0.5
percent, to 1,283 rand ($186) a metric ton at 9:48 a.m. in
Johannesburg. Meal made from the grain is the nation’s staple
food.  Yellow corn for December delivery rose 11 rand, or 0.8
percent, to 1,411 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as animal
feed in South Africa.  Wheat for December delivery was unchanged at 2,680 rand a
ton having earlier gained as much as 0.4 percent.  The gains or losses for the most-active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
