German coalition party leaders have
agreed with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble to tighten rules
on manager pay at banks that received state support, limiting
pay to 500,000 euros a year and barring bonuses, Handelsblatt
reported, citing unnamed coalition sources.  The pay curb will apply to all staff at banks such as Hypo
Real Estate Holding AG, where the state owns 75 percent or more
of the lender, the newspaper said. The rules will go to the
lower house this week, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
