Atos Origin SA will achieve an
operating margin of around 7 percent to 8 percent at the end of
2011, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Breton told daily La
Tribune in an interview.  Asked by the newspaper if the company will pay a dividend
for 2010, Breton said that it would be normal in time for Atos
to do so and that the decision doesn’t rest with him alone.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
