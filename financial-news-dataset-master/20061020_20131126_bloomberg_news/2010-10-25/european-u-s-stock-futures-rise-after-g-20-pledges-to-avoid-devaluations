European stocks  climbed, led by a
rally in basic-resource companies, as Group of 20 finance chiefs
heightened speculation the Federal Reserve will announce further
stimulus measures next week.  Rio Tinto Group  and Xstrata Plc advanced with metals as the
dollar tumbled even after the G-20 pledged to avoid “competitive
devaluation” of their currencies. Hermes International SCA
surged 15 percent as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA agreed
to buy a 17 percent stake. Banks limited gains as Banco Popolare
SC announced plans for a rights offer, increasing speculation
that other lenders may also need to boost capital.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rose 0.3 percent to
267.42 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the third gain in four
days. The gauge has climbed for the past three weeks as
companies from Nokia Oyj to Danone reported better-than-
estimated results and on optimism the Fed will announce another
round of bond purchases to boost growth.  “The market has chosen to interpret the outcome from the
G-20 as positive, but nothing much has changed at all,” said
 Jeremy Batstone-Carr , London-based head of research at Charles
Stanley & Co. “We could see some serious disappointment if the
Fed doesn’t deliver on quantitative easing” next week.  Dollar Weakens  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers ended talks in
South Korea on Oct. 23 saying they will refrain from
“competitive devaluation” and let markets have a bigger role
in setting foreign-exchange values. The dollar weakened as the
pledge failed to quell speculation that the Fed will announce
additional bond purchases at its November meeting.  National benchmark indexes rose in 14 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100  gained 0.2 percent
and France’s CAC 40 advanced less than 0.1 percent. Germany’s
DAX increased 0.5 percent.  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company,
rallied 2.5 percent to 4,208 pence. Xstrata, the fourth-biggest
copper producer, gained 2.7 percent to 1,324 pence and
Antofagasta Plc, which owns copper mines in Chile, rose 4.1
percent to 1,321 pence.  Copper  climbed to a 27-month high as investors sought
industrial metals to hedge against a decline in the dollar.
Lead, nickel, tin, zinc and aluminum also advanced on the London
Metal Exchange.  Hermes, LVMH  Hermes  soared 15 percent to 202.85 euros after LVMH agreed
to buy a 1.45 billion-euro ($2 billion) stake in the luxury-
goods maker. LVMH, which said it doesn’t intend to launch a
tender offer, take control of the company or seek board
representation, climbed 2.4 percent to 116 euros.  Hochtief AG climbed 2.1 percent to 64.80 euros. Spiegel
said Qatar is in talks to buy a stake in Germany’s largest
construction company as Hochtief seeks to thwart a hostile
takeover bid by Spain’s Actividades de Construccion & Servicios
SA. Qatar hasn’t made any decision on the potential investment,
the magazine reported, without saying where it got the
information.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc, Europe’s oldest
independent bourse, climbed 5 percent to 740 pence amid takeover
activity in the exchanges industry.  Singapore Exchange Ltd. agreed to buy ASX Ltd., Australia’s
stock market operator, for A$8.4 billion ($8.3 billion).
Germany’s Deutsche Boerse AG gained 0.4 percent to 52.27 euros.  TeliaSonera AB  rose 1.6 percent to 56.15 kronor after
Sweden’s largest phone company reported higher third-quarter
profit and raised its full-year forecast as customers in Sweden
bought more smartphones and Eurasian markets from Russia to
Nepal improved.  Earnings Season  Of the 50 companies in the Stoxx 600 to have released
earnings since Oct. 7, 70 percent have beaten estimates for per-
share income, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. In the
U.S., about 86 percent of S&P 500 companies have topped
predictions this reporting season.  Volkswagen AG preferred shares climbed 6.8 percent to
103.35 euros as analysts at Deutsche Bank AG raised their
 earnings estimates  for Europe’s largest carmaker after it last
week reported better-than-expected third-quarter results.  The brokerage raised its projections for earnings before
interest and taxes by 31 percent for 2010, 22 percent for 2011
and 26 percent for 2012, according to a report.  Banks Slide  Banco Popolare sank 5.6 percent to 4.06 euros, leading a
gauge of banks to the biggest drop among 19  industry groups  in
the Stoxx 600, after the Italian lender said it plans to raise 2
billion euros selling shares in a rights offer.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA slid 2.6 percent to 2.59 euros and
 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA  retreated 3.4 percent to
1.05 euros. The Italian banks may cut their dividends to avoid
holding rights offers to meet new banking capital standards, the
Financial Times said, citing an unnamed senior bank executive
and a director. Banks must have a Core Tier 1 ratio of at least
7 percent under Basel III capital rules agreed by regulators
last month.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc, the U.K.’s biggest mortgage
lender, declined 5.4 percent to 68 pence as Credit Suisse Group
AG cut its share-price estimate by 9.2 percent to 79 pence. The
brokerage cited the possibility of house-price declines and
concern that sales forecasts are too high.  The number of Britons who expect house prices to fall
outnumbered those forecasting an increase for the first time
since 2009 in the third quarter as concerns about the economy
mounted, Rightmove Plc said today.  Scania AB  tumbled 4.6 percent to 145.3 kronor after the
Swedish truck maker controlled by Volkswagen reported third-
quarter revenue of 18.6 billion kronor ($2.8 billion), missing
the 19.9 billion-krona average estimate of 17 analysts compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
