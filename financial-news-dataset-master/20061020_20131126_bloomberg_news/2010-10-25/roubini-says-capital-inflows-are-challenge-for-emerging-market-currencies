Nouriel Roubini, the New York
University professor who predicted the global financial crisis,
said capital inflows are a challenge in emerging markets and are
leading to currency appreciation.  Investors are pouring money into China, Brazil and Turkey,
while avoiding transfers to Argentina, Roubini said at an event
today in Buenos Aires. Argentina’s political and economic
situations are discouraging investments, he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
