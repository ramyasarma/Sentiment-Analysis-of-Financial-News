More than half of first-home buyers
in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane spend more than 30 percent of
their disposable income on housing costs, the level used to
define mortgage stress, the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing research from the National Centre for Social
and Economic Modelling. This is expected to increase further,
with interest payments as a proportion of household income for
all mortgages forecast to rise to a record 12 percent if the
Reserve Bank of Australia raises its benchmark rate to 6 percent
by the end of 2011, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
