  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Europe’s
biggest  oil company , hired its first trader in mainland China to
increase oil-product transactions with state companies including  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp . and PetroChina Co.  Bensen Ho is “now working for Shell and his role will be
China focused,” Li Lusha, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for the
oil company, said in an e-mail without giving further details.  Ho will oversee trading of products, including gasoline and
diesel, from Shell’s Beijing office, said a company official who
couldn’t be identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to
the media.  The 40-year-old Taiwanese joins from Glencore International
AG, the world’s biggest commodities trader, where he dealt in
oil products out of Beijing beginning early 2008. Previously, Ho
was a gasoline trader with Shell in Singapore and  Taiwan . He
started on Oct. 11 at his current job, according to the official.  Shell has fuel retail stations in China and is the
country’s top foreign supplier of lubricants, according to its
 China website . The Hague-based company also sells sulfur and
bitumen in China.  --Chua Baizhen. Editors: Jane Lee, Clyde Russell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
