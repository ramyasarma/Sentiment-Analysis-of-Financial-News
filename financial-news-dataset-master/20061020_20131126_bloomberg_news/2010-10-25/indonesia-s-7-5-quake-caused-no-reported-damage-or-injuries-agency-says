No injuries or damage have been
reported from a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the
Kepulauan Mentawai region of Indonesia, about 150 miles (240
kilometers) away from Padang, Sumatra, and 395 miles from
Singapore, Priayadi Kardono, a spokesman at the country’s
disaster management agency, said by phone in Jakarta.  The agency is in radio contact with officials in the
affected area, Kardono said. Telephone communication isn’t
operating, he said, adding the reason is unkown.  The quake was centered at a depth of 20.5 miles, according
to the USGS. A local tsunami watch is in effect, the Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center said. A “destructive widespread tsunami
threat” does not exist, according to the center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
