The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Rooney’s Agent  Manchester United coach  Alex Ferguson  said agents are
difficult to deal with after  Wayne Rooney  said he wanted to
leave only to sign a new contract, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Ferguson, whose son Jason was once an agent, said players
aren’t the problem in negotiations, the Telegraph added.  United Boost  Chelsea captain  John Terry  said Rooney’s new five-year deal
will boost Manchester United’s Premier League campaign,  The Sun 
reported.  Rooney’s criticism of United for holding back in the
transfer market may also persuade it to sign players in the
January trading window, the Sun quoted Terry as saying.  Arsenal’s Win  Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas said his team would have
beaten 10-man Manchester City yesterday even if its Premier
League rival had 15 players,  the Sun  reported.  City had Dedryck Boyata red-carded after five minutes and
went on to lose 3-0 yesterday. Fabregas said the Gunners played
some “outstanding” soccer and were unstoppable.  Liverpool Nerves  Liverpool coach Roy Hodgson said his team’s predicament
isn’t yet “hunky-dory” after its second win in nine league
games, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The Reds played anxiously in the last 20 minutes of a 2-1
home win against Blackburn, Hodgson said, and remain in the
Premier League relegation zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
