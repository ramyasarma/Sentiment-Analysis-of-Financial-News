The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
be unable to gain further after climbing 16 percent from this
year’s low, according to  John Fletcher , an exchange-traded fund
specialist and technical analyst at Charles Stanley in London.  A sell signal for the benchmark index for U.S. equities has
been triggered after 13 days on which the gauge closed at a
higher level than two days previously, Fletcher said in a phone
interview today, citing indicators developed by  Tom DeMark  of
Market Studies LLC.  “The large number of potential sell signals leaves me cold
to the thought of buying at current levels,” Fletcher said.
“While the daily chart is showing 13 sells, the weekly chart
has also been building and with the close last week registered a
sell 13 as well. The last sell 13 back in April 2010 resulted in
a drop from 1,219 to 1,010.”  The  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent to 1,183.08 on Oct. 22, ending
the week 0.6 percent higher. The measure has rallied 16 percent
from this year’s low in July amid better-than-estimated
corporate earnings and speculation that the Federal Reserve will
buy bonds to stimulate the economy, a tactic known as
quantitative easing.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns to forecast changes in a currency, commodity, security
or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
