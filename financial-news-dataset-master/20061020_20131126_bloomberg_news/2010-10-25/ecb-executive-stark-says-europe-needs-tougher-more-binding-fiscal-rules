European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said Europe needs stricter fiscal
rules to achieve more budgetary discipline.  “We need a depoliticized fiscal and macroeconomic
surveillance, stricter and more binding budget rules, simpler
sanctions for violations of the rules, and a closer coordination
of economic policies,” Stark wrote in a guest article for
Financial Times Deutschland. There’s also a risk that
consolidation efforts wane as soon as deficit reductions have
calmed financial markets, Stark wrote in the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
