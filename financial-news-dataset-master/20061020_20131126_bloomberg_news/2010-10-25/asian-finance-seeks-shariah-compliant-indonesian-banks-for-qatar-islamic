Asian Finance Bank Bhd., the
Malaysian unit of Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ, said it has identified
up to three Shariah-compliant banks for purchase in Indonesia.  Asian Finance is conducting a due diligence and aims for
the acquisition by Qatar Islamic to be completed by April next
year,  Mohamed Azahari Kamil , chief executive officer of the
Malaysian unit, said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur today.  Qatar Islamic, the Persian Gulf country’s biggest lender
that complies with the religion’s ban on interest, is seeking to
expand its services to take advantage of growth in the $1
trillion industry. Asian Finance also held meetings with
Australian government officials to advise them on Islamic
products, Azahari Kamil said in a phone interview on Oct. 20, as
the nation plans to change laws to attract investors from the
Middle East and Asia.  “The financial and legal due diligence is expected to be
completed by the end of the year,” he said. “We’re not looking
to pay a very high premium because our participation is to add
value to the bank.”  Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, is
studying ways to make tax laws more conducive to developing
Islamic finance, Mulya Siregar, director of Shariah banking at
the central bank, said on Oct. 20.  The  Islamic Financial Services Board , a Kuala Lumpur-based
standards body, and the Islamic Development Bank, forecast in
April the industry’s assets will reach $1.6 trillion by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
