South Korea’s won climbed for a
second day on speculation nations will uphold a Group of 20
nations’ pledge to avoid weakening currencies to lift exports.  The currency approached a five-month high after talks in
South Korea ended on Oct. 23 with an agreement to refrain from
“competitive devaluation” and to let markets set foreign-
exchange values more as they sought to calm fears that they risk
a trade war by using cheaper currencies to spur growth. Exports
account for about half of South Korea’s economy.  “The G-20 meeting will help the won strengthen since it
will be more difficult for authorities to intervene to control
gains,” said  Ha Joon Woo , a currency trader at Daegu Bank in
Seoul. “But I don’t think the currency war is really over.”  The won appreciated 0.5 percent to 1,117.80 per dollar as
of 9:40 a.m. in Seoul, following a 0.6 percent gain on Oct. 22,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency rose 3
percent in the past month, the best performance among Asia’s 10
most-used currencies excluding the yen. It touched 1,110.05 on
Oct. 14, the strongest level since May 3.  The  Kospi  share index climbed 0.2 percent, approaching its
best close since 2007, as overseas investors  bought  more Korean
shares than they sold for a third day. Bank of Korea Governor
Kim Choong Soo said “external uncertainties” that affect
interest-rate policy have been reduced after the meeting of
finance ministers and central-bank chiefs from Group of 20.  The yield on the 3.75 percent bond due June 2013 was 3.22
percent, according to prices from Korea Stock Exchange. It
reached 3.04 percent last week, a record low for a benchmark
three-year note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
