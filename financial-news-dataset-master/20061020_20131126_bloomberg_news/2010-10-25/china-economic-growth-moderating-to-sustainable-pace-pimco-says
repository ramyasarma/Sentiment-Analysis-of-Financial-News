China’s growth is slowing to a
“sustainable pace” and there is a low likelihood of the
country’s economy experiencing a so-called hard landing, Pacific
Investment Management Co. said today on its website.  “China’s role in the global economy will continue to
expand, underpinned by a strong national balance sheet and
still-nascent economic development,” said Chia-Liang Lian, a
Singapore-based fund manager at Pimco, which runs the world’s
largest bond fund, in a discussion posted on the company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
