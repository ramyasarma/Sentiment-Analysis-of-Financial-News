Novartis AG’s  Menveo vaccine
provoked an immune response to four main strains of a
meningitis-causing disease in infants, potentially offering
protection against brain and spinal cord infections.  The vaccine met the goals of a late-stage study in
meningococcal disease in infants, the Basel, Switzerland-based
company said today in a statement. The data was presented at a
conference in Vancouver, Canada, Novartis said.  The shot shields against the A, C, W135 and Y strains at
the same time, and would be the first that can be given as early
as 2 months of age, the company said. Novartis plans to ask U.S.
regulators to approve it by the end of the year.  The study involved more than 4,500 infants who received
routine immunizations with or without Menveo at 2, 4, 6 and 12
months of age. One month after the last shot, the babies’ immune
response had built to between 94 percent and 100 percent,
depending on the strain. Menveo didn’t significantly change the
response to routine vaccines, with the exception of a slightly
lower response to a pneumococcal shot, Novartis said.  Meningococcal disease is a leading cause of meningitis, an
infection of the membrane surrounding the brain and spine, as
well as blood infection, which can lead to brain damage,
learning disabilities, hearing loss and loss of limbs.  Over 500,000 children globally contract the disease every
year, and about 10 percent die.  To contact the reporter on this story:
