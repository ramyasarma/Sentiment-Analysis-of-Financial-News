Scania AB , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG , said third-quarter profit jumped
eightfold as demand for heavy trucks increased.  Net income rose to 2.31 billion kronor ($350 million), from
278 million kronor a year earlier, the Soedertaelje, Sweden-
based company said in a statement. The profit exceeded the
average estimate of 2.13 billion kronor in a Bloomberg  survey  of
nine analysts. Sales rose 38 percent to 18.6 billion kronor.  Scania is benefiting from rising demand in emerging
 markets , including Brazil. Scania’s orders in the third quarter
gained 45 percent to 15,424 trucks and buses. Swedish rival
Volvo AB, the world’s second-largest truckmaker, on Oct. 25
posted a 2.81 billion kronor profit, beating analysts’
estimates.  Scania’s shares fell 2.2 percent to 149 kronor as of 9:03
a.m. in Stockholm trading.  Daimler AG , the world’s largest truckmaker, and German
rival  MAN AG  are scheduled to report earnings Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
