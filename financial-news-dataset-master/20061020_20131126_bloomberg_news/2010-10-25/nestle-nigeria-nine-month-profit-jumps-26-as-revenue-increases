Nestle Foods Nigeria Plc , the
country’s biggest food company by market value, is poised to
report an increase of more than 20 percent in full-year profit,
CSL Stockbrokers Ltd. said.  Nestle today said net income for the nine months through
September increased 26 percent to 9.11 billion naira ($60.1
million) from a year earlier, according to a statement e-mailed
by the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange today.  The results indicate “Nestle remains on track to deliver
close to 20 percent sales growth in 2010, with earnings-per-
share growth potentially higher than that,” CSL analysts
Oludare Fajimolu and  Tunde Abidoye  wrote in a note to clients
dated today. CSL has offices in Lagos and London. “The
potential double-digit earnings growth outlook is likely to
continue to support the shares.”  Nestle shares have increased 62 percent this year,
outperforming a 20 percent advance in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index  over the same period. The stock closed
unchanged at 387.95 naira by 1 p.m. in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
