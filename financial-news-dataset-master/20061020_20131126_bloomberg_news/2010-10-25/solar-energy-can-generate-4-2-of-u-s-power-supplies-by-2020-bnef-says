Solar power may meet 4.2 percent of
U.S. electricity supplies by 2020 as lower costs make
investments more attractive, according to a report from
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Investments in solar energy reaching $100 billion during
the next decade would boost capacity to 44,000 megawatts, up
from  1,400 megawatts today , the London-based research and
analysis company said today in a statement.  A drop in costs for both solar thermal technology and solar
photovoltaic panels to less than $200 a megawatt-hour has helped
increase returns on investments. Commercial rooftop solar
systems generate returns of 8 percent to 14 percent in some
states and more in states with strong incentives such as Hawaii,
Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts.  “There is a very positive growth story for solar in the
U.S.,”  Michael Liebreich , chief executive officer of New Energy
Finance, said in the statement. “A few more years of support,
and then the engine of unsubsidized competitiveness will take
over.”  Commercial solar systems will make up about half of total
installations, with the remainder split evenly between
residential rooftops and large utility-scale plants. About 2.4
percent of households will have a solar system by 2020, the
group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
