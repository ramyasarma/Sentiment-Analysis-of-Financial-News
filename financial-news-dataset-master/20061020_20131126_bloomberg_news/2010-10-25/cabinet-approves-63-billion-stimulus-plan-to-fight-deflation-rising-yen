Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
Cabinet approved a 5.1 trillion yen ($63 billion) stimulus
package to fight  deflation  and combat the stronger yen.  The package will be funded by an extra budget for the year
ending March 2011 worth 4.43 trillion yen, with the remainder
coming from money made through cost cuts and frontloading of
public works projects, according to a document released by the
Finance Ministry in Tokyo today.  The government doesn’t plan to issue new bonds to cover the
cost of the supplementary budget, an indication it may not sell
debt to pay for extra spending for the first time since 1999.
The extra budget will be deliberated in parliament.  Separately, the government will make 1.5 trillion yen from
the nation’s foreign exchange special account available to the
Japan Bank for International Cooperation for overseas investment
and infrastructure projects, the Finance Ministry said.  The move reflects Kan’s efforts to win infrastructure
projects abroad and take advantage of a stronger yen, which rose
to a 15-year high yesterday against the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
