Eskom Holdings Ltd. said its planned
Medupi and Kusile power plants in South Africa are expected to
start electricity production later than originally targeted.  The first unit of Medupi is now expected to come on stream
in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with an initial start
date of September 2011, the utility said in an e-mailed
statement today.  First commercial production from Kusile is now expected
“at the beginning of 2015,” compared with an earlier forecast
of June 2013, Eskom said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
