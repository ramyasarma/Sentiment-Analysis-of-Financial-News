heater on a crude unit, according to a filing with the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  PBF Energy Co. LLC Chairman  Thomas O’Malley  said more U.S.
refineries that are poorly located and inefficient will shut
down. He said the refining industry is in a shakeout period and
that refining margins will be “difficult” as the U.S. economy
recovers.  Some refineries in France may need weeks to restart
operations after strikes against the government’s pension
reforms, Energy Minister  Jean-Louis Borloo  said. Borloo said
Oct. 22 that France has boosted gasoline imports, and imports
into the U.S. Northeast have been below seasonal averages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
