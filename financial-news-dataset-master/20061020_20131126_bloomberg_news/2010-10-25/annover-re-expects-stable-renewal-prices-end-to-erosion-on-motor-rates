Hannover Re , the world’s third-
biggest reinsurer, expects prices for German reinsurance
contracts renewed in January to remain unchanged and said the
"premium erosion" in the motor segment may end.  “Although conditions remain difficult in some lines,
including for example motor business, I am still confident that
we shall again maintain our profitability in the coming year,”
 Michael Pickel , Hannover Re’s management board member in charge
of the German reinsurance business, said today at a press
conference in Baden-Baden, Germany.  Hannover Re, led by Chief Executive Officer  Ulrich Wallin ,
reiterated its 2010 earnings target in August after quarterly
profit fell 24 percent, saying the company plans to reach net
income of 600 million euros. The reinsurer is scheduled to
report third-quarter results Nov. 10.  For 2011, the company expects market conditions and the
premium trend to remain “largely stable,” it said in a
statement. “Sustained competition” can be observed in German
motor insurance, where Hannover Re “expects that the premium
erosion will be largely halted in 2011.”  The Hanover, Germany-based company operates in the country
under the E+S Rueck brand. Hannover Re owns 63.7 percent of the
unit, with eight mutual insurers including HUK-Coburg Holding AG
and VHV Versicherung AG owning the remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
