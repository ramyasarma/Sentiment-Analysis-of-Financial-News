The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange
asked the market regulator to introduce short selling in the
United Arab Emirates to improve the country’s chances for
emerging market status at index provider MSCI Inc.  Other requests to the regulator include trading by margin
and the introduction of delivery-versus-payment system,  Rashed Al-Baloushi , deputy chief executive officer of the bourse, said
in an interview in Beirut today. “All these things are on the
way” and the requests “meet the requirements of MSCI for the
U.A.E. to be promoted to emerging markets status,” he said.  The U.A.E. is ranked as a frontier market at MSCI.  In a short sale, an investor borrows and sells stock to
profit from price declines. Delivery versus payment is a
securities industry procedure in which payment for a security
must be made when the security is delivered. Usually, the
payment is made to a bank, which in turn pays for the security.  To contact the reporters on this story:
