British power companies will tell
U.K. energy secretary  Chris Huhne  that a proposed “floor
price” for carbon emission permits isn’t enough incentive to
invest in nuclear power stations, the Financial Times reported.  Executives from companies including  Centrica Plc , EDF
Energy Plc and Iberdrola SA’s Scottish Power Ltd. are scheduled
to meet with Huhne at a dinner this week, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Additional incentives could take the form of feed-in
tariffs or generation capacity reward payments, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
