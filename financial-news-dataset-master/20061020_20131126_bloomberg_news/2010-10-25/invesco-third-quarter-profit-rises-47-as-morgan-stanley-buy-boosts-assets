Invesco Ltd . said third-quarter
profit increased 47 percent, aided by the purchase of Morgan
Stanley’s mutual funds business in June.  Net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to
$154.7 million, or 32 cents a share, from $105.2 million, or 24
cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based Invesco said in a statement
today. Excluding some items, earnings of 39 cents a share beat
the  average  estimate of 35 cents in a Bloomberg  survey  of 18
analysts.  The $1.37 billion takeover, which included the New York-
based Morgan Stanley’s Van Kampen unit, will add about 21 cents
a share to earnings in the first 12 months after closing and 23
cents in the second year, Invesco said in June. The deal was the
company’s largest since its $1.54 billion purchase of Britain’s
Perpetual Plc in 2001, and added $114.6 billion to assets under
management.  “The deal now makes them more relevant among third-party
distributors,”  Mark Lane , an analyst at William Blair & Co. in
Chicago, said in an interview before results were announced.  Investors deposited a net $4.9 billion into long-term funds
and withdrew $2.4 billion from money-market funds. Market
appreciation added $34.4 billion after the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index gained 8.8 percent last month, the best September since
1939. Foreign exchange movements increased assets by $8.2
billion.  Flanagan’s Push  Invesco fell 21 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $22.11 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
has fallen 5.9 percent this year, compared with the 0.8 percent
decline for the Standard & Poor’s 15-company index for asset
managers and custody banks.  Martin Flanagan , who took over as chief executive officer
in August 2005, has boosted assets through acquisitions and cut
costs by making Invesco’s subsidiaries work more closely
together. The company said Oct. 11 that assets under management
as of Sept. 30 climbed 45 percent to $604.5 billion.  The Aug. 18 acquisition of Australian investment manager
Concord Capital Ltd. added $3.1 billion, while the sale of Echo
Point Investment Management reduced assets by $1.4 billion.  Revenue rose 35 percent to $953.1 million, driven by a 27
percent jump in investment management fees to $725.8 million,
reflecting the higher assets. Expenses grew by 39 percent to
$770.2 million, driven by the acquisition. Employee compensation
increased by 27 percent to $304.1 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
