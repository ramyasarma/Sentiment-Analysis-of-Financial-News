The pound depreciated versus the
yen, reaching the lowest level in nearly 22 months, as declining
mortgage approvals heightened speculation that the Bank of
England may soon be pressed into buying assets.  Lenders granted 31,104 home loans in September, the least
since March 2009, compared with 31,781 in August, the British
Bankers’ Association said today. The pound rose versus the
dollar, which fell against all of its most active peers, after a
Group of 20 pledge to avoid devaluations reduced bets
governments will buy the greenback to weaken their currencies.
The pound was little changed versus the euro.  “Economic reports are likely to bolster a view that the
Bank of England will sooner rather than later start buying
assets to support the economy again,” said  Ian Stannard , a
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London.
“That’s not going to bode well for the pound.”  One pound bought 126.77 yen at 4:05 p.m. in London,
compared with 127.62 yen last week, after weakening to 126.46
yen earlier, the lowest level since Feb. 2, 2009. The U.K.
currency traded 0.3 percent stronger against the dollar at
$1.5727. Sterling strengthened 0.2 percent against the euro to
88.79 pence, after earlier depreciating to 89.42 pence, the
weakest level since March 31.  The pound declined 2.6 percent in the past month, making it
the worst-performer in a basket of 10 currencies, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  House Prices  The currency recorded its biggest weekly loss against the
dollar since August last week as speculation mounted that the
Bank of England may soon resume its so-called quantitative
easing program.  The number of Britons who expect house prices to fall
outnumbered those forecasting an increase for the first time
since 2009 in the third quarter as concerns about the economy
mounted, said Rightmove Plc, the operator of Britain’s biggest
property website.  G-20 officials, ending a meeting in South Korea on Oct. 23,
agreed to allow markets to set foreign-exchange values, seeking
to calm fears over a potential trade war. Policy makers called
for reduced trade imbalances, without embracing a U.S. proposal
for targets. G-20 members will meet again in Seoul on Nov. 11
and 12.  The pound also weakened before a report tomorrow which
economists said will show the U.K. economy grew at a slower pace
in the third quarter. Output grew 0.4 percent from a 1.2 percent
gain in the second quarter, according to a median forecast of 35
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Quantitative Easing  “The GDP tomorrow will have a big impact on market
expectations of QE,” said  Adrian Schmidt , a currency strategist
at Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  The only major currency rivaling the dollar’s decline since
July is the pound, and foreign-exchange strategists say the
worst is yet to come.  Strategists are the most pessimistic on the pound versus
the euro since the ruling Conservative-Liberal Democrat
coalition came to power in May, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s pledge to cut spending
by 81 billion pounds through 2015 will force Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  to print cash through quantitative easing
to prevent a new recession, according to UBS AG.  Gilts Rise  UBS, the second-biggest currency trader after Deutsche Bank
AG, recommended on Oct. 21 its clients sell the pound,
especially against the Swiss franc, Australian dollar and
Norwegian krone.  Gilts rose, with the 10-year yield falling four basis
points to 2.91 percent. The 4.75 percent security maturing in
March 2020 rose 0.31, or 3.1 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount,
to 114.96. Two-year yields were little changed at 0.63 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
rather than benchmark German bunds slipped 1 basis point to 47
basis points.  Thirty-year gilts underperformed before the Debt Management
Office sells a 4.25 percent 2040 gilt through banks this week.
The yield spread between 10- and 30-year gilts was little
changed at 112 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
