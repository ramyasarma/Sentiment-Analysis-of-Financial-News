Japanese  stock   futures  fell on
concern the yen near a 15-year high against the dollar will
crimp export earnings. Australian stocks declined.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., a
Japanese carmaker that gets more than 70 percent of its sales
abroad, dropped 0.4 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions and
Vaio computers, sank 0.5 percent. ASX Ltd., the operator of
Australia’s main stock exchange, dropped 3.4 percent today
following a 19 percent jump yesterday after a takeover bid.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,385 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,430 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,390 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index fell 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose
0.4 percent in Wellington.  “There are risks that the yen may strengthen further,”
said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co.  The yen appreciated to 80.41 against the dollar yesterday
after stock trading closed in Tokyo, the highest level since
April 1995. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies
when overseas revenue is converted into their home currency.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The index advanced 0.2 percent yesterday in New York on
speculation the Federal Reserve will announce further bond
purchases next week and as sales of U.S. existing homes jumped a
record 10 percent in September.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has increased 9.2 percent in
2010, compared with gains of 6.3 percent by the S&P 500 and 5.3
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.4 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.4 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for December delivery gained 1 percent to settle
at $82.52 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper futures climbed
to $3.8895 a pound in intraday trading, the highest level since
July 2008. Gold futures increased 1 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
