Japanese  stocks  fell, led by makers
of cars and electronics, as the yen strengthened to a 15-year
high, cutting the outlook for export earnings.  Toyota Motor Corp. , which gets more than 70 percent of its
sales abroad, and Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker,
both lost 1.1 percent. Shionogi & Co. dropped 2.7 percent after
the drugmaker cut its profit forecast, citing foreign-exchange
rates and one-time losses.  KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone network operator, surged 7.3 percent after
announcing a buyback plan and higher profit.  “Investors are watching how cautious companies will become
because of the yen’s appreciation,” said  Kenji Sekiguchi ,
general manager of strategic research and investment at
Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees about $75
billion in Tokyo.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.3 percent to 9,401.16
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo. The  Topix  index declined
0.4 percent to 821.23, with more than twice as many stocks
retreating as advancing among its 1,662 companies.  The  Nikkei 225  has decreased 11 percent this year, the most
among the world’s 40 largest equity markets. Shares in the index
traded at 16.5 times estimated earnings on average, near their
highest level since August.  KDDI jumped 7.3 percent to 436,000 yen, the  biggest
increase  in the Nikkei 225 and the most-active stock in Japan by
value traded. The company said it will spend as much as 100
billion yen to buy back up to 5.2 percent of its shares. Net
income rose 10 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, the
company also said.  Earnings Peak  Oct. 29 is the  peak day  for earnings reports in Japan, with
271 of the companies in the Topix scheduled to report results,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Toyota slid 1.1 percent to 2,893 yen and Canon lost 1.1
percent to 3,745 yen, the heaviest drags on the Topix. Kyocera
Corp., an electronics maker that gets more than half its sales
abroad, fell 1.8 percent to 8,310 yen and was the  heaviest drag 
on the Nikkei 225. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions
and Vaio computers, decreased 0.4 percent to 2,724 yen.  The yen appreciated to as high as 80.66 per dollar today in
Tokyo, the highest level since April 1995. A stronger yen cuts
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The yen is headed for its strongest annual average level
against the dollar since currencies began trading freely in 1971,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day’s
closing price.  ‘Economic Fundamentals’  “The current dollar-yen rate isn’t at a level that
reflects economic fundamentals,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “The yen is too strong.”  The Group of 20 agreed to “move towards more market-
determined exchange-rates systems that reflect underlying
economic fundamentals and refrain from competitive devaluation
of currencies,” its finance ministers and central bankers said
after talks on Oct. 23 in Gyeongju, South Korea.  “There are still worries about the yen’s gaining strength
further, even after the G-20,” said  Tomochika Kitaoka , a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co. “It’s hard for
investors to buy Japanese stocks.”  Toshiba Corp., a maker of electronics and power equipment
that gets more than half of its revenue abroad, will prepare
ways to withstand an exchange rate of 70 yen to the dollar,
including halting unprofitable operations, Nikkei English News
reported, citing President  Norio Sasaki .  Central Bank Policy  The Bank of Japan will probably leave policy unchanged this
week to gauge whether cutting  interest rates  to near zero and
pledging to buy financial assets will shield the economy from
the yen’s advance to a 15-year high. All 15 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News say the bank will refrain from any action at
its Oct. 28 gathering after unexpectedly cutting rates on Oct. 5
and creating a 5 trillion-yen fund to purchase assets including
corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds and real-estate
investment trusts.  Shionogi lost 2.7 percent to 1,467 yen, the lowest close
since Sept. 1 after the company cut its full-year profit  outlook 
by 17 percent to 30 billion yen. Nomura Holdings Inc. reduced
its 12-month share-price estimate to 1,600 yen from 1,700 yen.  To contact the reporters for this story:
