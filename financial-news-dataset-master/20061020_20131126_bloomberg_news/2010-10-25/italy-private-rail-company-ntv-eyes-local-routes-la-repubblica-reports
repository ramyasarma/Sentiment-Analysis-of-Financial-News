Private rail company  Nuovo Trasporto
Viaggiatori  may compete on local routes if Italian authorities
allow it, Chief Executive Officer Giuseppe Sciarrone told la
Repubblica in an interview.  “We’d like to operate services on regional links,” the
Rome-based newspaper quoted Sciarrone as saying. “If Parliament
decides to open the market to competition, we’d be ready.”  NTV will next year start competing with state railway
company Trenitalia on the country’s high-speed line from
Milan to Rome.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
