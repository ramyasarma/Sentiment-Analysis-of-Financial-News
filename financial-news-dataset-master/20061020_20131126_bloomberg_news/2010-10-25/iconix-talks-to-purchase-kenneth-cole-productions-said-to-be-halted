Iconix Brand Group Inc . has halted
talks to buy designer  Kenneth Cole ’s shoe and clothing company,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  When the talks will restart isn’t clear, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the process isn’t public.  New York-based Iconix, run by Kenneth’s brother  Neil Cole ,
owns brands such as Candie’s and London Fog, and licenses them
to retailers and manufacturers. It hasn’t run retail stores.  In addition to owning the Kenneth Cole brand,  Kenneth Cole
Productions  Inc., also based in New York, operates 110 stores,
based on its last annual report. Kenneth Cole’s market
capitalization was $269 million as of Oct. 22.  New York Times reporter  Andrew Ross Sorkin  said on CNBC
earlier today that the talks had fallen apart.  Iconix spokeswoman Tara Levy declined to comment. A
representative from Kenneth Cole didn’t immediately return a
call.  Kenneth Cole Productions fell 92 cents, or 6.2 percent, to
$13.87 at 10:50 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Iconix rose 8 cents to $17.59 on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
