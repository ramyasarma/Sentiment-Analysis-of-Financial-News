The franc gained versus the dollar
after a Group of 20 pledge to avoid “competitive devaluation”
failed to dispel speculation the Federal Reserve will make more
bond purchases, boosting demand for the Swiss currency as a
haven.  The franc also snapped a three-day losing streak against
the euro. The dollar slid against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts after the statement by G-20 finance ministers and
central bankers meeting in South Korea included no commitment by
the U.S. to refrain from more so-called quantitative easing.  The franc is “really one of the darlings of the foreign
exchange markets right now and people will continue to move into
it very aggressively, especially in these conditions where
there’s not going to be a general consensus of currency policies
from the G-20,” said  Peter Rosenstreich , chief market analyst
at ACM Advanced Currency Markets in Geneva. “The market’s
clearly focused on U.S. data and basically how big the U.S.
quantitative easing package is going to be.”  The franc gained 0.6 percent against the dollar,
appreciating to 0.9713 at 5:05 p.m. in London. It strengthened
0.3 percent versus the euro, to 1.3586, after earlier weakening
to 1.3672, the lowest since Aug. 11. It has climbed 3.7 percent
this year against a basket of currencies, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
