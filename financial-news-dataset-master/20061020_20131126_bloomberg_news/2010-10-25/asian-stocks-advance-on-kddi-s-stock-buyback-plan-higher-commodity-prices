a couple months ago when the market was more concerned about
fiscal risks,” said  Hidehiro Tomioka , who helps manage about
$1.4 billion in Tokyo at MFC Global Investment Management
(Japan) Ltd. “Merger activity is one trend that may continue,
supported by good cash flow. If these companies were worried
about a double-dip, they would be cautious in expanding their
businesses.”  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  climbed 1.3 percent and
Singapore’s Straits Times Index increased 0.5 percent. Hong

Exchange sank 5.6 percent to S$9.01.  The merger will combat rising competition, Singapore
Exchange’s Chief Executive Officer Magnus Bocker and ASX CEO
Robert Elstone said. It would be the first between two exchange
companies in the Asia-Pacific region and will create the world’s
fifth-largest exchange company by market value.  “Regulators will want to ensure any merger upholds the
integrity of the Australian stock exchange and does not
compromise it in any shape or form,” said  Tim Schroeders , who
helps manage about $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne.  Hong Kong Exchanges  Speculation of more mergers in the region drove publicly
traded bourses higher.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. ,

further, even after the G-20,” said Tomochika Kitaoka, a senior
strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co. “It’s hard for
