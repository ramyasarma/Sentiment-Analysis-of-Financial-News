Croatia has a chance to wrap up its
European Union entry negotiations in 2011 as long as it deepens
an overhaul of the legal system and fights corruption,  European
Commission  President  Jose Barroso  said.  “This may be possible by next year if Croatia steps up its
efforts, but as I say, many challenges remain,” Barroso told
reporters in Brussels today. “We cannot commit at this stage to
a precise date. Substance is more important than timing.”  Croatia’s original target date for joining the bloc was
2009. The bid was halted for 10 months last year by a border
dispute with Slovenia, the EU’s only ex-Yugoslav member. Once
the talks are over, Croatia would need the endorsement of every
EU government before entry, a process that takes a year or more.  “We’re very strong, and committed and determined,” Croatian
Prime Minister  Jadranka Kosor  said at the press conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
