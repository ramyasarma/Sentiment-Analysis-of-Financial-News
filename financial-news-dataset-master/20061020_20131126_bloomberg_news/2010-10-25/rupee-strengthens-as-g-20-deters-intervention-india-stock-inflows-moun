India’s rupee rose the most in a
week after the nation’s finance chiefs, along with their
counterparts in the Group of 20 nations, pledged to refrain from
intervening in currency markets to support exports.  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers vowed to avoid
“competitive devaluation” on Oct. 23, following talks in South
Korea. Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn said
Oct. 14 policy makers may buy dollars to combat appreciation
that hurts exporters. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive
Index, or  Sensex , rose 1.3 percent today to 20,419 as exchange
 data  showed foreigners bought more Indian shares than they sold
every day since August.  “We will have to wait for the Sensex to break the 20,500
level to take a view on the pace of inflows,” said  Navin Raghuvanshi , a Mumbai-based currency trader at Development
Credit Bank.  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent to 44.42 per dollar as of
10:54 a.m. in Mumbai, its biggest gain since Oct. 14, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has strengthened 5.7
percent in the past three months and touched 43.96 on Oct. 15,
the strongest level since August 2008.  Funds based abroad have pumped a record $24 billion into
Indian equities this year and bought $9.8 billion of local bonds,
seeking to profit from an improving economy. Gross domestic
product will climb 9.7 percent this year following growth of 5.7
percent in 2009, the International Monetary Fund forecast Oct. 6.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 44.97
to the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
45.21 on Oct. 22. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets
at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled
in dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
