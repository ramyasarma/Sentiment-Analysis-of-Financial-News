Genesis Energy LP , a crude-oil
partnership that has risen 34 percent this year, agreed to pay
$330 million for Valero Energy Corp.’s 50 percent stake in a
pipeline that delivers petroleum from the Gulf of Mexico to
refineries in Texas.  Genesis will pay cash for the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline,
a 380-mile (611-kilometer) system capable of delivering up to
500,000 barrels of oil a day, according to a statement issued by
the Houston-based partnership today.  Enterprise Products Partners LP owns the other 50 percent
of Cameron and operates the pipeline, built in 2004, Genesis
said. The pipeline was created to move oil from deep-water
fields in the Gulf to refineries, according to its  website .  Offshore production in the Gulf accounts for 30 percent of
U.S. oil and 13 percent of natural gas  output , according to the
Energy Department.  The sale is expected to close by the end of the year,
subject to regulatory approvals,  Bill Day , a spokesman for San
Antonio-based Valero, said in an e-mailed statement.  Genesis  fell  80 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $25.25 a share at
4:03 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Valero rose 12 cents to $17.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
