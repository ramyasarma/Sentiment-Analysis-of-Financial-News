As the recession pushed U.S. incomes
down last year, America’s highest earners -- 72 people who made
more than $50 million -- earned an average of $84 million each.  Those top-end Americans earned a combined $6 billion in
2009, down from $11.9 billion earned by 131 individuals with
wages above $50 million in 2008, according to Social Security
Administration data. Nationally, the average annual wage fell by
$598 to $39,055 and the median wage fell by $253 to $26,261
during the worst economic slump since the Great Depression.  The Social Security Administration today corrected its
statistics on top earners that were released Oct. 15. A mistake
was discovered in an internal review of the W-2 forms used to
compile the data, said Mark Lassiter, an agency spokesman. The
agency discovered that two people filed multiple W-2 forms
totaling more than $32 billion.  “We discovered an error in the net compensation for wage
earners earning $50 million and over and have adjusted those
figures downward,” Lassiter said in an e-mail.  The Social Security administration didn’t offer details
about the 72 top earners in the corrected report. They pay a 35
percent marginal tax rate, plus a 2.9 Medicare tax. According to
the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent of households, those with
adjusted gross incomes above $380,354, paid 38 percent of all
federal income taxes in 2008. The bottom 95 percent, those with
adjusted gross incomes below $159,619, paid 41.3 percent.  The figures count only income subject to Medicare taxes,
such as wages and tips. Income from investments isn’t counted.  Overall, the Social Security Administration said 150.9
million Americans reported wages in 2009, down 4.5 million from
the year before. Unemployment has hovered close to 10 percent
for more than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
