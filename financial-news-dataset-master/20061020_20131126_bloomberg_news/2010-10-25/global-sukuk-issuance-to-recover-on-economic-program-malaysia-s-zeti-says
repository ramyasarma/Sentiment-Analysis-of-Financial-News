(Corrects attribution to Malaysia’s prime minister in first
paragraph.)  Global sukuk sales will be boosted
by Malaysia’s 10-year Economic Transformation Program and
issuance is set to improve after falling 16 percent this year,

Islamic Finance Forum in Kuala Lumpur today.  “These funding needs will be addressed through a sukuk-
raising exercise as the global market picks up,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
