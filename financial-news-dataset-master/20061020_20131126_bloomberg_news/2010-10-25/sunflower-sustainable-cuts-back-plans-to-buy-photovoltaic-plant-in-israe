Sunflower Sustainable Investments
Ltd. said it’s cutting back a planned purchase of photo voltaic
facilities in Israel. The company will now buy facilities with a
combined expected capacity of 2.5 megawatts for about 35 million
shekels, rather than the 5 megawatts capacity for 70 million
shekels originally planned, according to a statement filed today
with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
