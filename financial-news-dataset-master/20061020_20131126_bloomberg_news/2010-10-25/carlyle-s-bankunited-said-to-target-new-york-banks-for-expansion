BankUnited, the Florida lender owned
by investors including  Blackstone Group LP , Carlyle Group and WL
Ross & Co., plans to use proceeds from an initial public
offering to take over New York-based banks, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the bank’s plans.  BankUnited, which plans to file for an IPO this week, is
aiming to raise more than $500 million in the sale, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the matter is
private. In addition to raising funds for acquisitions, the
bank’s private-equity backers will sell some of their stakes,
the person said.  John Kanas , BankUnited’s chief executive officer, plans to
use relationships with New York regulators and bank executives
to make purchases, the person said. Kanas built Melville, New
York-based North Fork Bancorp. through acquisitions and then
sold the company to Capital One in 2006 for about $15 billion,
four times the company’s book value, according to Carlyle’s
quarterly letter to investors. Kanas led the investor group’s
takeover of BankUnited last year.  Melissa Gracey , a spokeswoman for BankUnited, declined to
comment.  The Deal earlier reported the date of the planned IPO
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
