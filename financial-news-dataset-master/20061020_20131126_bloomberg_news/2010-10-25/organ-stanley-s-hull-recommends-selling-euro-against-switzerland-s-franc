Morgan Stanley advised selling the
euro against the Swiss franc, because a rise in borrowing costs
may cause stress in the euro area’s economy, while in
Switzerland “leading indicators of activity remain sound.”  “Switzerland’s large current account surplus is likely to
mean that the franc will not weaken much further,”  Stephen Hull , London-based head of global currency strategy, said today
in an e-mailed note. Investors should bet the franc will
appreciate to near 1.28 per euro, he said. They should end the
bet if the franc weakens to 1.3950.  The franc appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.3603 per euro as of
3:07 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
