China will increase gasoline and
diesel prices starting tomorrow, National Business Daily
reported, citing the country’s top economic planner.  Diesel prices will rise by 220 yuan ($33) a metric ton and
gasoline prices will gain by 230 yuan a ton, the Shanghai-based
newspaper said, citing the National Development and Reform
Commission. Wen Bugao, a Beijing-based press official at the
NDRC, said he hasn’t received any notice on price increases yet.  The NDRC controls fuel prices to curb inflation and last
raised them by as much as 4.6 percent in April. The planning
agency then cut prices in June. China has made 11 adjustments
since introducing a mechanism in December 2008 that allows the
government to revise prices when crude costs change more than 4
percent over 22 working days.  Crude in New York has climbed 14 percent since June 1, when
China reduced the price of gasoline by 230 yuan a ton and diesel
prices by 220 yuan a ton.  Higher gasoline and diesel prices will add to costs for
manufacturers and farmers and increase inflationary risks.
Consumer-price growth quickened to 3.6 percent in September.  -- Wang Ying  in Beijing and  Winnie Zhu  in Shanghai. Editors:  Ryan Woo ,  Jane Lee .  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
