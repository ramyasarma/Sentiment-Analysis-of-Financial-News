The krona appreciated to its
strongest level in three weeks against the euro amid speculation
Sweden’s central bank will raise interest rates tomorrow.  The nation’s currency was also lifted on concern the Group
of 20 pledge to avoid “competitive devaluation” won’t stop the
U.S. Federal Reserve from stepping up asset purchases. The
Riksbank will raise its main lending rate by 25 basis points to
one percent tomorrow, according to all 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. European and U.S. stocks gained.  The krona’s appreciation “has to do with positioning ahead
of tomorrow,” said  Arne Lohmann Rasmussen , head of currency
research at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “We think it could
head towards 9.12. Risk appetite is high after the G-20 meeting
yesterday.”  The Swedish currency strengthened 0.5 percent to 9.1901
against the euro at 2:31 p.m. in London. It earlier reached
9.1885, the strongest since Oct. 1.  The currency gained 1 percent to 6.5556 versus the dollar.
It has climbed 6.5 percent this year against a basket of
currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
