KDDI Corp. , Japan’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, rose the most in almost two years in
Tokyo trading after the company said it will spend as much as
100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) on a share buyback.  KDDI  climbed 7.3 percent to close at 436,000 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, its biggest gain since Nov. 25, 2008. The
Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent.  The company said after the close of trading on Oct. 22 that
it will buy back as much as 5.16 percent of its outstanding
shares and has no plans to finance operations through
borrowings. The Tokyo-based carrier’s  net income  climbed 10
percent to 65 billion yen in the three months ended Sept. 30 as
the  fixed-line  unit returned to profit.  “The buyback is a surprise and is aimed squarely at
shareholder returns, something the market should welcome,”
 Daisaku Masuno , a Tokyo-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
wrote in a report dated Oct. 22. Masuno maintained his
“neutral” rating on KDDI.  The carrier, forecasting a profit decline in its mobile-
phone operations, is looking to a recovery of the fixed-line
business to help achieve its target for full-year net income to
rise 13 percent to 240 billion yen.  KDDI bought a 361.7 billion yen stake in cable-television
provider  Jupiter Telecommunications Co.  to access more fixed-
line customers and has said it aims to make money from the
business this fiscal year. The unit, which offers services over
fiber and copper cables, posted quarterly profit of 1.71 billion
yen, compared with a loss of 11.6 billion yen a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
