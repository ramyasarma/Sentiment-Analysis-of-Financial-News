Scania AB , the Swedish truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG , fell the most in a year after
third-quarter revenue and orders trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares  dropped  7 kronor, or 4.6 percent, to 145.30
kronor at the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Stockholm. That’s
the  steepest  decline since Oct. 26, 2009.  Third-quarter  sales  were 18.6 billion kronor ($2.84
billion), missing the 19.9 billion-kronor average estimate in a
Bloomberg  survey  of 17 analysts, the Soedertaelje, Sweden-based
company said today. Orders in the quarter rose 45 percent to
15,424 trucks and buses.  Morten Imsgard , an analyst with Sydbank
A/S in Aabenraa, Denmark, had expected orders to reach around
18,000.  “The net order intake and the revenue were a bit weaker
than expected,” said Imsgard, who has a “neutral” rating on
the stock. “They have to assure investors that they can keep up
growth momentum and the best way to assure that is with a high
order intake.”  Scania has hired 1,000 workers in the last two quarters on
temporary contracts to “ensure flexibility” as the recovery in
Europe remains subdued. Scania generated  more than half  of its
third-quarter sales in the region.  “It’s a very mixed picture in Europe,” Chief Executive
Officer  Leif Oestling  said in an interview. Switzerland, Austria
and the Nordic nations “are steaming on pretty well today with
good demand for vehicles,” while demand in southern Europe
remains weak, he said.  MAN Talks  Scania and German rival  MAN AG , of which VW has 29.9
percent of the voting rights, announced in July that the two
truckmakers are studying whether to work together on hybrid
components research as well as to share gearboxes and axles.  “We are just in the middle of the evaluation work,”
Oestling said today. “We need a number of months more before we
can say exactly where and how” it will turn out.  Scania’s third-quarter net income rose to 2.31 billion
kronor from 278 million kronor a year earlier. The profit
exceeded the average estimate of 2.13 billion kronor in
Bloomberg’s  survey  of nine analysts.  Swedish rival  Volvo AB , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, said Oct. 22 that profit in the quarter was 2.81
billion kronor compared with a loss of 2.92 billion kronor a
year earlier. Revenue rose 32 percent to 64 billion kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
