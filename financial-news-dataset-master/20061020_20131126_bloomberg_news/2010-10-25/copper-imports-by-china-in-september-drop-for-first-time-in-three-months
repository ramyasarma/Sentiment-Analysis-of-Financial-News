Imports of refined copper by China,
the largest consumer, declined for the first time in three
months in September as lower domestic prices reduced the appeal
of buying overseas.  Inbound shipments totaled 241,771 metric tons last month,
the General Administration of Customs said in an e-mailed report
today. That’s 9.5 percent lower than 267,153 tons in August and
14.5 percent less than 282,828 tons a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  “London prices gained more than Shanghai in the last
couple of months, so it wasn’t profitable to ship the metal into
China,” Lai Qiwen, a manager at Guantong Futures Co., said by
phone from Beijing today. “The domestic output was also at a
high level, damping demand for imports.”  Chinese copper production increased for the first time in
three months in September, up 2 percent to 405,000 tons from
397,000 tons in August. Copper for three-month delivery on the
London Metal Exchange has gained around 40 percent since a year-
to-date low of $6,037.50 a ton on June 7, while its Shanghai
counterpart only increased by about 29 percent during the same
period.  Copper stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures
Exchange increased to nearly two-month high to 106,275 tons,
according to data provided by the bourse. That’s the highest
level since the week ended Aug. 27.  “Imports will probably drop a little further from the
September level in coming months, as sufficient supplies of
local concentrate can meet refined copper production,”  Fang Junfeng , an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co., said by phone
from Shanghai.  Copper concentrate output in China rose 7.2 percent to
119,000 tons last month from 111,000 tons in August, the
statistics bureau said.  -- Helen Sun . Editors: Richard Dobson, Jarrett Banks.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
