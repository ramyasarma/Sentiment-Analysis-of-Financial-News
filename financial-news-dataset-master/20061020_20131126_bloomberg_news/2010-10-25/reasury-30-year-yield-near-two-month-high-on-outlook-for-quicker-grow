(Corrects five-year TIPS yield in eighth paragraph.)  Treasury 30-year yields were near
the highest level in two months as economists said an industry
report today will say home sales rose and government figures at
the end of the week will show economic growth accelerated.  Two-year yields were three basis points away from a record
low on speculation the Federal Reserve will increase its
Treasury purchase as soon as next month to spur the expansion.
Yields on longer-maturity bonds haven’t fallen as much due to
concern efforts to boost growth will lead to quicker inflation.
The government is scheduled to sell $10 billion of five-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities today.  “Long-term investors shouldn’t buy Treasuries,” said
 Hiroki Shimazu , an economist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc., part of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s third-largest publicly traded bank by assets. “The U.S.
economy continues to recover. The inflation rate will rise.”  The 30-year bond yielded 3.92 percent as of 9:56 a.m. in
Tokyo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 3.875
percent security due in August 2040 traded at 99 7/32. The rate
climbed to 4.01 percent on Oct. 15, the highest since Aug. 10.  Two-year notes yielded 0.36 percent, compared with a record
low of 0.327 percent set on Oct. 12.  Growth Quickens  Gross domestic product expanded at a 2 percent annual pace
in the third quarter, up from 1.7 percent in the prior three
months, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before the Commerce Department report Oct. 29. Sales of  existing 
homes rose for a second month in September, a separate Bloomberg
survey showed ahead of today’s report from the National
Association of Realtors.  Rising sales at companies from  Boeing Co.  to chipmaker
 Intel Corp.  and railroad  CSX Corp.  show U.S. businesses are
growing even before a boost investors predict from the next
round of Fed monetary easing.  Five-year TIPS yielded negative 0.52 percent, compared with
0.55 percent at the previous auction on April 26. Investors  bid 
for 3.15 times the amount at that sale, versus an average of
2.38 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect  bidders , the category that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 23.1 percent of the notes, versus the
10-sale average of 32.6 percent.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
