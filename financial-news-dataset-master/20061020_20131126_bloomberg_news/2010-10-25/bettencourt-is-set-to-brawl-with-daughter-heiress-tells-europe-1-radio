L’Oreal SA  heiress  Liliane Bettencourt  said she is in good health and “ready for a brawl”
with her daughter in a radio interview recorded two days after
she filed a harassment complaint.  Bettencourt, who turned 88 on Oct. 21, told Europe 1 radio
in an interview aired today that she didn’t invite her daughter
to celebrate with her and said she filed the complaint after her
daughter sent a third request for her mother to be placed under
a court-ordered guardian’s care.  “I think that I couldn’t have done otherwise,” said
Bettencourt to Europe 1. “I am ready for a brawl.”  Bettencourt, France’s richest woman, and her daughter,
Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, have been engaged in a three-year
battle over gifts to photographer and author Francois-Marie
Banier. Meyers claims Banier abused her mother’s “frailty” to
get gifts of art, real estate and insurance policies, while
Bettencourt insists she was fully aware of her actions.  Secret recordings of Bettencourt, made by a former butler,
spawned related inquiries into allegations of campaign finance
violations related to President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s 2007 election.
Bettencourt denied giving him cash in violation of French laws.  “No, of course I don’t give out money like that,” she
said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
