AIA Group Ltd.  traded 9.2 percent
higher than its initial public offering price in unofficial
over-the-counter trading yesterday after raising $17.8 billion
in its Hong Kong IPO, according to three people with knowledge
of the transactions.  AIA’s shares last traded at HK$21.50 ($2.77) each yesterday
according to “gray market” transactions brokered by Cantor
Fitzgerald LP, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information isn’t public. New York-based  American
International Group Inc.’s  main Asia unit priced its IPO at
HK$19.68 a share last week and the stock is scheduled to start
official trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Oct. 29.  Fuel Prices Rise  China, the world’s biggest energy consumer, increased
retail gasoline and diesel prices by 3 percent today as part of
government measures to cool the economy and to meet energy-
saving targets.  The ceiling for gasoline prices will rise by 230 yuan
($34.50) a metric ton and diesel prices will gain 220 yuan a ton,
the National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic
planner, said in a statement on its website yesterday.  China Railway Saudi Loss  China Railway Construction Corp.  builder of more than half
the nation’s railroads, will book a loss of 4.15 billion yuan on
its Mecca light-rail project, pending compensation talks with
the client.  The construction contractor will book a charge of 3.605
billion yuan in the third quarter of 2010, causing “material”
damage to  earnings  for the three-month period and the year, the
company said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  Chalco Sees FY Profit  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer
of the metal, forecast a full-year profit even as it reported a
consecutive quarterly loss after government power controls
curbed aluminum output.  Chalco, as the Beijing-based company is known, had a loss
of 117.8 million yuan for the three months ended Sept. 30,
according to a  statement  to the Shanghai stock exchange. The
loss compared with a profit of 21 million yuan a year earlier.  ZTE U.S. Orders  ZTE Corp ., China’s second-biggest maker of telephone
equipment, said it plans to buy $3 billion in semiconductor
parts from  Qualcomm Inc .,  Texas Instruments Inc .,  Freescale
Semiconductor Inc .,  Altera Corp . and  Broadcom Corp .  The purchases will happen over three years and are aimed at
helping ZTE improve sales to telecommunications customers in the
U.S., according to an e-mail from the Shenzhen, southern China-
based company. The U.S. has become the focus of ZTE’s efforts to
boost business, including agreements to sell two devices through
Verizon Wireless.  China Home Prices  Singapore  and  China  led the world in home-price
appreciation in the second quarter amid accelerating economic
growth in both countries, according to real estate consultant
Knight Frank LLP.  Home prices in Singapore gained 37 percent from a year
earlier, according to a statement by TJE London-based company.
In mainland China, based on the cities of Beijing and Shanghai,
prices rose 36.8 percent, Knight Frank said.  Japan-China Ties  Foreign Minister  Seiji Maehara  said Japan is working to
mend frayed ties with China while at the same time looking for
alternative sources of rare earth metals.  “It’s certainly not good for our own resource security to
rely on a single country,” Maehara said yesterday in an
interview in Tokyo. With China controlling 97 percent of the
rare earth market, “we’re in the process of diversifying our
supply sources.”  Ghana China Loans  Ghana will start work on projects funded with $9 billion of
loans from Chinese banks next year, Trade Minister  Hannah Tetteh 
said.  The projects, agreed upon during President  John Atta Mills ’s visit to China last month, will be preceded by technical
preparations that will have to be approved by parliament, Tetteh
told reporters in the capital, Accra.  MARKETS:  U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
