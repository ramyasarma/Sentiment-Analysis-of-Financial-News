Emaar Properties PJSC, the biggest
publicly traded real-estate developer in the United Arab
Emirates, said it will take all actions to protect the interest
of its Indian unit after media reports said India will fine
Emaar MGF Land Ltd. for delay in delivering the Commonwealth
Games Village in New Delhi.  “The encashment of the guarantee has no direct impact on
Emaar as the guarantee has been issued by the facilities
available to the company in India,” Emaar said in a statement
to the Dubai bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
