The International Renewable Energy
 Agency  appointed Adnan Amin from Kenya as interim director
general, succeeding Helene Pelosse from France, the Abu Dhabi-
based organization said in an e-mailed statement.  Amin was selected in August as Irena’s deputy interim
director-general. He was born in 1957.  “My priority will be to put Irena on a firm institutional
footing and to develop a compelling vision for the future of
renewable energy worldwide,” he said, according to a press
statement from the agency, which held a preparatory commission
meeting today in Abu Dhabi, attended by 300 delegates from more
than 100 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
