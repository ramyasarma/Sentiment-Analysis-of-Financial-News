Housing Finance Ltd. , Kenya’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, said nine-month profit surged
80 percent as loans to customers increased.  Net income jumped to 250 million shillings ($3.1 million)
in the period ended Sept. 30, from 139 million shillings a year
earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Net interest income, the money lenders make from issuing
loans, advanced 24 percent to 1.04 billion shillings as total
loans increased by more than a third to 18 billion shillings,
Managing Director  Frank Ireri  said in the statement.  “The firm expects further growth during the year and into
2011 driven by a robust demand for mortgages and favorable
interest rates,” Ireri said.  Demand for housing in Kenya, East Africa’s biggest economy,
picked up after the central bank cut interest rates six times
since the beginning of 2009 to a record low of 6 percent. Urban
areas in Kenya need 150,000 housing units a year, compared with
the 35,000 currently available, resulting in overcrowding and
informal settlements, according to Housing Finance.  Last month, Housing Finance sold 7 billion shillings of
bonds to supply more mortgages. The seven-year securities are
expected to begin trading on the Nairobi Stock Exchange at the
end of this month, Ireri said.  Shares in Housing Finance fell as much as 3.4 percent and
were trading down 50 cents, or 1.7 percent, at 29 shillings at
11:27 a.m. in Nairobi. The stock has surged 61 percent so far
this year, outperforming a 44 percent increase in the benchmark
 NSE-20 index  over the same period.  The decline in the stock was “down to people exiting to get
into other financials,”  George Bodo , a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview
today. “There are guys who bought it as low as 20 shillings.”  Housing Finance traded at 31.5 shillings on Oct. 18, the
highest since July 2008, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
