Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. , the Chinese
company that paid more than $3 billion for Australia’s Felix
Resources Ltd., rose the most in two weeks in Hong Kong trading
after third-quarter profit more than tripled from a year earlier.  The  shares  gained as much as 3.7 percent to HK$22.55 at
10:22 a.m. local time, the biggest increase since Oct. 11. The
benchmark Hang Seng index rose 0.8 percent.  Third-quarter net income increased to 3.68 billion yuan
($553 million) as production rose to meet domestic demand,
according to a statement released by the Hong Kong stock
exchange on Oct. 22. Benchmark coal prices in China gained 28
percent in July to September from a year earlier, data from the
China Coal Transport and Distribution Association showed.  Yanzhou advanced 3.2 percent to 29.39 yuan in Shanghai
trading, beating the 0.1 percent decline in the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
