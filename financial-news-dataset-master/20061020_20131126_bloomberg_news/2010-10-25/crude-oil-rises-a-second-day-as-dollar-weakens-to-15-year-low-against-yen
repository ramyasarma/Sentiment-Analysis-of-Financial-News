Crude oil rose for a second day as
the dollar slumped to a 15-year low against the yen, bolstering
the appeal of raw materials as an alternative investment.  Oil climbed 1 percent as the U.S. currency dropped on
skepticism the Group of 20 pledge to avoid devaluations can stem
the dollar’s decline. Workers at three French oil refineries
voted to return to work as a contested pension bill neared
parliamentary approval.  “Today’s move is dollar related,” said  Carl Larry ,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “We should
continue to track the dollar this week and will also be keeping
an eye on equities.”  Crude oil for December delivery gained 83 cents to settle
at $82.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
are up 2.5 percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for December settlement gained 58 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $83.54 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London.  The dollar declined 0.6 percent to 80.88 yen after earlier
dropping as much as 1.2 percent to 80.41, the lowest level since
April 1995. The euro gained 0.2 percent at $1.3975, after
touching $1.408.  G-20 officials, who ended talks in South Korea on Oct. 23,
vowed to avoid weakening currencies to lift exports. They
pledged to refrain from “competitive devaluation” and to let
markets set foreign-exchange values. Members will meet again in
Seoul on Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.  Equity Indexes  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index advanced 0.5 percent to
1,189.16 at 3:14 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  increased 0.6 percent to 11,199.96.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials
gained 1 percent to 300.19.  Workers at  Exxon Mobil Corp. ’s 233,000-barrel-a-day Port-
Jerome-Gravenchon refinery in Normandy and its 119,000-barrel
Fos refinery, near Marseille, voted to go back to work today,
Jean-Michel Maton, a union representative, said in a telephone
interview.  Employees at the  Petroplus Holdings AG  Reichstett refinery
in the east of France also voted to return to their jobs,
according to a union statement.  Workers at ports, refineries and fuel suppliers are
opposing President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plan to increase the
retirement age to 62 from 60. The pension bill is expected to be
approved by lawmakers within two days.  Strike Resolution  “With our expectation of the pension reform bill to be
passed by Wednesday, a resolution to the strikes may be,
finally, on the cards towards the end of the week,” said  Amrita Sen , an oil analyst at Barclays Capital in London, in a note.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase shipments by 1.2 percent in the four weeks to Nov. 6,
according to Oil Movements, which monitors tanker charters. The
group will export 23.33 million barrels a day during the period,
the Halifax, England-based consultant said on Oct. 21.  “Renewed weakness in the dollar, combined with China-led
demand for raw materials, is propelling the crude market higher
again today,” said  Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache
Commodities Ltd. in London. “Prices would be even higher if
Saudi Arabia were not feeding extra barrels to the market.”  Saudi Arabia produced 8.25 million barrels of crude oil a
day in September, exceeding its quota by 199,000 barrels a day,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of companies, producers and
analysts. The country had 3.25 million barrels a day of spare
production capacity.  The desert kingdom is the biggest crude producer in OPEC
and holds the world’s  largest reserves .  Higher Price  Oil supplies are “coming from the same kinds of areas,”
said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, in
an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We are going to need a
somewhat higher oil price looking out over the next five years
than we have had historically to take account of strong growth
and where the supply is coming from.”  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in New York crude-oil futures in the
week ended Oct. 19, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
said last week.  Managed money bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 163,641
contracts, the Washington-based regulator said in its weekly
Commitments of Traders report. Net long positions fell by 15,097
contracts, or 8.5 percent, from a week earlier.  Oil volume on the Nymex was 457,694 contracts as of 2:54
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 388,105
contracts on Oct. 22, 44 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.39 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
