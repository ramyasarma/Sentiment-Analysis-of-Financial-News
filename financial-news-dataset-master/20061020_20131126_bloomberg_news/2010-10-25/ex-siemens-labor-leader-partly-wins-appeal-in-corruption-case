Germany’s top criminal court partly
overturned the conviction of a former labor leader at  Siemens AG 
who was caught up in a corruption scandal at the company.  Wilhelm Schelsky , former head of the AUB Association of
Independent Employees, had a count of breach of trust set aside,
the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe said in a statement.
Fraud and tax evasion convictions against Schelsky were upheld,
the court said.  The case was part of a corruption scandal over bribes to
customers and labor unions that had roiled Siemens, Europe’s
biggest engineering company, for several years. Schelsky and
former management board member  Johannes Feldmayer  were convicted
over payments intended to help make AUB an “employer friendly”
labor group at the Munich-based company.  The trial court was wrong to convict Schelsky of aiding a
breach of trust by inducing people at the company to use 30.3
million euros ($42.5 million) in Siemens funds to finance AUB,
the top court said. While his actions violated labor laws, these
rules weren’t intended to protect Siemens’s assets, according to
the appeals judges.  Schelsky will receive a new sentencing hearing in the case.
Schelsky is on parole after serving about two thirds of a 4 1/2
year prison sentence.  Feldmayer had received a suspended prison term of two
years, a 28,800 euro-fine and was ordered to pay 200,000 euros
to charity as a condition for parole.  The case is BGH, 1 StR 220/09.  To contact the reporter on this story:
