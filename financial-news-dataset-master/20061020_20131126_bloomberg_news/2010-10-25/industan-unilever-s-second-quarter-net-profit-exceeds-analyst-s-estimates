Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , India’s
biggest household products maker, reported a 32 percent jump in
second-quarter profit after it increased prices of some soaps
and detergents and boosted revenue from food.  Net income  climbed to 5.66 billion rupees ($128 million) in
the three months ended September, from 4.29 billion rupees a
year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in statement today.
Profit beat the 5.2 billion rupees average of 28 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 11 percent to 46.8
billion rupees.  The maker of Dove shampoo and Fair and Lovely skin cream
raised prices on some soaps and detergents by as much as 10
percent, and stepped up spending on advertising and marketing,
according to Anand Rathi Financial Services Ltd. The full effect
of the price increases at  Hindustan Unilever  and rival consumer
companies may be seen only in the third quarter, Anand Rathi
analysts  Shirish Pardeshi  and  Aniruddha Joshi  wrote Oct. 20.  The Unilever unit’s shares climbed 2 percent to 307.25
rupees as of 2:40 p.m. in Mumbai trading, while the benchmark
Sensitive Index rose 0.9 percent.  “Our domestic consumer business has delivered double-digit
underlying volume growth for the third quarter in a row,”
 Hindustan Unilever  Chairman  Harish Manwani  said in the
statement.  Revenue at the foods business grew 13 percent driven by
sales of beverages and ice cream, the company said. Processed
foods, which include Kissan brand sauces and Knorr soups, grew
26 percent, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
