The United Nations said at least
eight rebels died following an attack on Indian peacekeepers in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  About 50 armed men ambushed a UN base in Rwindi in North
Kivu province on the night of Oct. 23 for unknown reasons, the
UN mission in Congo said in an e-mailed statement today. The
renegade fighters were killed after the peacekeepers returned
fire, the statement said. The peacekeepers suffered no
casualties, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
