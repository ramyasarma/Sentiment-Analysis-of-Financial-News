The National Football League asked
 Cablevision Systems Corp . to go into binding arbitration to get
the league’s channel to the company’s 3 million subscribers, the
New York Post reported.  Cablevision , based in Bethpage, New York, has offered to
use that process to end its dispute with News Corp.’s Fox
network, which has kept that programming off its system for
about two weeks. The disagreement with Fox blocked some Major
League Baseball playoff games from Cablevision.  The Post reported that the NFL sent the cable company a
letter suggesting that it also use binding arbitration to settle
their dispute over the football channel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
