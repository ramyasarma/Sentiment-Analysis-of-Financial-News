Canada’s dollar rose with stocks and
raw materials after a pledge by Group of 20 finance ministers to
avoid “competitive devaluation” failed to dispel speculation
the Federal Reserve will ease announce further stimulus
measures.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, touched the
strongest level in a week after government reports last week
showed measures of inflation and retail sales rose more than
economists predicted. The greenback was down against 15 of 16
major currencies.  “Following the G-20, investors feel more confident getting
back into risky trades,”  Mark McCormick , a currency strategist
at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, wrote in an e-
mail. “The Canadian dollar is gaining from a host of post-
domestic data and the rally in risk assets.”  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.7 percent to C$1.0186
per U.S. dollar at 8:08 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0259
on Oct. 22. It touched C$1.0154, the strongest since Oct. 18.
One Canadian dollar buys 98.18 U.S. cents.  The  MSCI World Index  of equities climbed 0.6 percent.
Futures on crude oil, Canada’s largest export, advanced as much
as 1.6 percent to $82.99 a barrel. Gold, copper, zinc and lead
also strengthened.  G-20 officials, ending a meeting in South Korea on Oct. 23,
agreed to refrain from “competitive devaluation” and allow
markets to set foreign-exchange values, seeking to calm fears
over a potential trade war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
