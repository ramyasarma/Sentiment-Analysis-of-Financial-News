Korea Line Corp.  slumped to its
lowest in four years in Seoul trading after South Korea’s
second-largest bulk sea carrier said it will sell new shares.  The  stock  fell 13 percent to close at 38,900 won, its
lowest price since October 2006, on the Korea Exchange. Korea
Line was the  worst performer  on the benchmark Kospi index, which
gained 1 percent.  Korea Line said after the market closed on Oct. 22 it will
sell 4 million new shares in December at an initial estimated
price of 31,600 won apiece, or 29 percent lower than that day’s
closing price of 44,750 won. The  Baltic Dry Index , a measure of
commodity shipping prices, has declined 9.3 percent this year on
concern the industry will suffer from excess capacity as more
vessels enter service.  “Some shareholders may decide not to buy the shares given
the weak bulk-shipping market,” said  Shin Ji Yoon , an analyst
at KTB Securities Co. in Seoul.  Korea Line will set the price of the new shares on Dec. 2,
it said in a regulatory filing. The proceeds will be used for
working capital, the company said.  A total of 55.8 million deadweight tons of new bulk
carriers were delivered in the first nine months of this year,
29 percent more than the 43.2 million tons for all of 2009,
according to  Clarkson Plc , the world’s largest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
