APN News & Media Ltd. , the company
that owns New Zealand’s largest newspaper, agreed to extend
about A$600 million ($593 million) of bank loans.  Most of the debt was due to mature in 2011 and was extended
by five years, according to a regulatory filing today. APN,
based in Sydney, continues to consider a sale of retail bonds in
New Zealand, according to the filing.  “The new debt structure lays the platform for the company
to successfully execute our strategy of becoming the leading
multimedia operator in each of our local markets and of
diversifying our funding sources,” Chief Financial Officer
 Peter Myers  said in the statement.  APN  shares  have more than doubled since last March as the
global economic recovery spurs renewed business confidence. The
company earns more than  half  its revenue in Australia, where
advertising spending may rise 6.6 percent to a record A$13
billion in 2011, the Australian Financial Review reported last
week, citing media buyer Harold Mitchell.  APN is considering issuing as much as NZ$150 million of
five-year bonds, according to an Oct. 18 filing. The company
owns the New Zealand Herald, the nation’s  most-read  newspaper.
It also owns regional publications in Australia and has radio,
online and outdoor advertising businesses, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
