China Railway Construction Corp. 
builder of more than half the nation’s railroads, will book a
loss of 4.15 billion yuan ($623 million) on its Mecca light-rail
project, pending compensation talks with the client.  The construction contractor will book a charge of 3.605
billion yuan in the third quarter of 2010, causing “material”
damage to  earnings  for the three-month period and the year, the
company said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.  The contract, originally valued at 6.7 billion riyals ($1.8
billion), called for 18 kilometers (11 miles) of track linking
religious sites around Mecca and Medina. The client subsequently
raised planned capacity, changed other instructions and delayed
land purchases, China Railway said yesterday. The contractor
added resources to ensure on-time completion this month.  “The company has been in negotiations with the owner for
the compensation for the above variations,” China Railway said.
“In accordance with accounting standards, the company has not
included the amounts of such compensation claims in the
estimated total revenue from the contract.”  China Railway said it booked 548 million yuan of losses
from the contract in 2009 and the first half of 2010.  The  stock , halted yesterday, will resume trading in Hong
Kong today, the company said. It’s gained 12 percent this year,
outpacing the 8 percent increase in the benchmark Hang Seng
Index. China Railway rose 4.9 percent to HK$11.16 on Oct. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
