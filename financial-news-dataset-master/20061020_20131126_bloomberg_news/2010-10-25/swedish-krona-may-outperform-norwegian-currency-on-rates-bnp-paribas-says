The Swedish krona may outperform
Norway’s krone this week as the Riksbank raises interest rates,
while the Norges Bank keeps borrowing costs unchanged, BNP
Paribas SA said.  “The divergence in monetary policy in Scandinavia is
likely to be highlighted this week,” analysts led by  Hans- Guenter Redeker , global head of foreign-exchange strategy in
London, wrote in a note to clients today. The krone “is
expected to come under pressure” against the krona, the
analysts said.  The krona strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.1363 per krone as
of 1:44 p.m. in London. It appreciated to 1.1342 on Oct. 12, the
strongest level since January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
