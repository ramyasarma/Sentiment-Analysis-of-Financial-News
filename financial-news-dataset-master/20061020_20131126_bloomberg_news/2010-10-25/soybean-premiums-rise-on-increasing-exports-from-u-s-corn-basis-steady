Cash premiums for soybeans at export
terminals near New Orleans this month rose relative to Chicago
futures as oilseed inspections for overseas rose to the highest
level in 11 months. Corn premiums were steady after futures
rose.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
October rose to 47 cents to 55 cents a bushel above November
futures, compared with 45 cents to 53 cents on Oct. 22, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. The  average spot price  rose
to $12.6875, the highest level since July 2009. Corn premiums
were unchanged at 57 cents to 58 cents a bushel above December
futures.  “Soybean-export shipments are active, and farmers have
stopped selling,” said Luke Vander Aarde, a cash merchandiser
at U.S. Commodities LLC in Minneapolis. “Corn bids are firm and
will likely begin to strengthen because farmers have shut the
door on any additional sales.”  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed 18.25 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to close at $12.1775 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade, ending a two-session slump.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 8.75 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $5.6875 a bushel.  In the week ended Oct. 21, soybeans inspected for export
rose 5.4 percent to 68.344 million bushels from a week earlier,
the government said today. That was the highest level since late
November.  Farmers are planning to store supplies before the
government updates crop estimates on Nov. 9, Vander Aarde said.
Many growers sold more of this year’s crop than they had planned
after hot, dry weather in August reduced yields, he said.  “Exporters are trying to draw supplies out from the
northern Midwest before the Mississippi River closes for the
winter,” Vander Aarde said. “Once the river closes, it will be
difficult to get supplies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
