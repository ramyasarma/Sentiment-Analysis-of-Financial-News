Russian stocks climbed to their
highest in more than six months after Group of 20 finance chiefs
agreed to avoid weakening currencies to lift exports and oil and
metals gained.  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel, billionaire Viktor
Rashnikov’s steelmaker, increased 2.9 percent. OAO Gazprom, the
country’s gas export monopoly, added 0.9 percent, while oil
producer OAO Gazprom Neft gained 1.1 percent, helping push the
Micex Index 0.6 percent higher to 1,528.24 at the 6:45 p.m.
close in Moscow. The 30-stock gauge pared gains after earlier
advancing to its strongest since July 24, 2008.  Finance ministers of the G-20 leading economies pledged to
refrain from “competitive devaluation” and let markets set
foreign-exchange values and increase the influence of  emerging
markets  within the  International Monetary Fund . Oil,  Russia ’s
main export earner, rose as much as $1.59 to $83.28 a barrel in
 New York . Tin, zinc, nickel, lead and copper all advanced on the
London Metal Exchange. OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , Russia’s largest
miner, added 2.8 percent to 5,613.08 rubles, its biggest gain in
2 1/2 months.  “The G-20 move, which is derivative of dollar weakness
spurring the appeal of commodity markets, is one of the things
helping Russian stocks today,” Michael Kart, a managing partner
at Moscow-based investment firm Marshall Spectrum Ltd., said by
phone. “Rising oil and commodity prices are also supporting
sentiment and risk-taking by investors.”  VTB Group, Russia’s second-largest lender, advanced to its
strongest in more than 2 1/2 years after its price target was
lifted at Citigroup Inc., which forecast rising profit and
accelerating loan growth next year. The stock gained 2.4 percent
to 10.38 kopeks, its highest since January 2008. The shares have
surged 18 percent this month.  ‘Sentiment Has Changed’  Russian stocks, the world’s best performers last year,
increased 6 percent this month as crude  oil prices  climbed 3.6
percent amid signs the global economic recovery is gaining pace.  “Russia is suddenly at the forefront of the high-beta
markets again,” Vladimir Savov, head of research at Moscow-
based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp., said by phone.
“Sentiment has changed. Clients are calling us again asking
about Russia and we are seeing significant fund flows over the
past three weeks.”  The ruble gained for a third day versus the dollar,
strengthening 0.4 percent to 30.2475 in Moscow. The currency was
0.2 percent weaker against the euro at 42.4025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
