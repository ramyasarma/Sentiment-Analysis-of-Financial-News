KazMunaiGas Exploration Production,
a unit of state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co., said output
declined after 1,000 workers walked off the job to protest the
arrest of a company driver for alleged possession of heroin.  The workers, most of them drivers, haven’t reported for
work since Oct. 21, when their informal leader was detained on
his way to work in Zhanaozen, western Kazakhstan,  Mikhail Dorofeyev , a KazMunaiGas EP spokesman, said by telephone today
from the capital Astana.  The workers demand that the case be dropped, Dorofeyev
said. They have made no complaints against the company, he said.  Traffic police stopped three drivers on their way to the
oil fields on the morning of Oct. 21 and tested two of them for
alcohol, the Vremya newspaper  reported  two days later. Police
then searched one driver’s truck and said they found a match box
containing 0.4 grams of heroin and some hashish, the newspaper
reported, citing Estai Karashayev, an oilfield official with
KazMunaiGas EP.  As news of the driver’s detention spread, about 2,000
employees halted work in a show of protest, saying police had
planted the drugs, Vremya said, citing Karashayev.  Apart from the drivers, most workers who took part in the
protests have returned to work, KazMunaiGas EP said in an e-
mailed statement. The company said it lost 1,098 metric tons of
production during the demonstrations.  “The extent to which the company’s annual output figures
are affected will depend on how quickly stable production at
this unit is restored,” KazMunaiGas EP said.  The company said in March that its Ozenmunaigaz unit was
working weekends and holidays to compensate for 27,600 metric
tons of oil output lost during a strike from March 1 to March
18. As many as 3,000 workers struck over wages after the company
moved to a new salary system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
