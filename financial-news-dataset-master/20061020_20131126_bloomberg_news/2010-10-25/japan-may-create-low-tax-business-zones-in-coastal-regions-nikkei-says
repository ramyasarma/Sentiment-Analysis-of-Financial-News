Japan may include a proposal to
create special business zones with lower tax rates as part of
the government’s fiscal 2011 tax reform plan, Nikkei English
News said, without citing anyone.   The government may start selecting locations for the zones
as early as next summer, the report said. Coastal areas in
Tokyo, Osaka and Kobe are among likely regions for the zones,
the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
