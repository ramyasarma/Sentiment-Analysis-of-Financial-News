Maria Boyazny , a managing director
with Siguler Guff & Co., is leaving to start a firm for credit
and distressed debt deals in a joint venture with G2 Investment
Group.  The new company, MB Global Partners, plans to raise money
to make investments in other funds as well as directly, focusing
on areas such as corporate debt, residential mortgage debt and
commercial real estate, New York-based G2 said today in a
statement. Boyazny will be the majority shareholder of the firm.  Investment managers are looking for new ways to invest
money as Wall Street stabilizes after the global credit crisis.
That crisis has wiped out much of the equity invested in
leveraged buyouts and real estate, leaving creditors with
control of many assets.  “This will be the decade of credit,” Boyazny said in an
interview.  Boyazny joined Siguler Guff in 1997 and managed its four
funds focused on distressed opportunities. Prior to Siguler
Guff, she worked in investment banking at Smith Barney.  She earned a bachelor’s degree from the Wharton School at
the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA from Columbia Business
School.  G2 Investment Group, created by former Guggenheim Partners
co-founder  Todd Morley , is managing assets for wealthy families
and institutions through efforts including Forbes Capital Group,
a partnership with the Forbes family. G2 also has also started
units to focus on credit trading and real estate deals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
