BM&FBovespa SA , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, gained the most in
more than a week on speculation the stock is undervalued after
Singapore Exchange Ltd. agreed to buy ASX Ltd., Australia’s main
stock exchange, for A$8.4 billion ($8.35 billion).  BM&FBovespa surged 3.1 percent to 14.27 reais, the most
since Oct. 13. The benchmark Bovespa index rose 0.6 percent.  “The deal with the Singapore and Australia exchange gives
a positive outlook for the sector,” said  Joao Pedro Brugger ,
who helps oversee $42 million at Leme Investimentos in
Florianopolis, Brazil. “The price seemed pretty good.”  The operator of Singapore’s stock market is offering A$48
per ASX share, 37 percent more than the company’s last price on
Oct. 22, the companies said. Shares in ASX closed below the
offer price at A$41.75 on concern the deal may not be approved
by Australia’s government or regulators. The two exchanges will
remain separate legal entities and be regulated locally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
