London Underground users may face
disruption to their journeys today after maintenance workers
began an indefinite work-to-rule action at midnight in a
dispute over maintenance practices.  Transport for London, which manages public transport in
the capital, said yesterday that it was seeking more efficient
ways to do maintenance work, without compromising safety. The
 Rail, Maritime and Transport Union , which represents
Underground workers, said Oct. 19 that the planned changes are
“playing fast and loose with safety” and workers following
all rules to the letter would have a “major” effect.  Londoners still face the threat of a one-day strike next
week if London Underground and the RMT don’t resolve a separate
dispute over safety and staffing practices. Talks between the
two sides are planned at the U.K.’s state-funded Advisory,
Conciliation and Arbitration Service today, Lou Owen, an ACAS
spokeswoman, said yesterday.  There were minor delays to the circle line today,
following a signal failure, according to TfL’s website.  The RMT has already staged two 24-hour walkouts during the
dispute, shutting large portions of the network. Travelers on
the subway system suffered a series of line closures last week
because of cracked and defective rails. The RMT said the
shutdowns were directly linked to an earlier union ban on
working overtime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
