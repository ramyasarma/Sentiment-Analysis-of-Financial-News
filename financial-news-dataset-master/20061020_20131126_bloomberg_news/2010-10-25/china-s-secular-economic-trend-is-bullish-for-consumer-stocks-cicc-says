China’s focus on both income growth
and redistribution in its next five-year economic plan is
bullish for the nation’s consumer stocks, according to China
International Capital Corp.  “This emerging affluent mass is rapidly becoming an
important social-economic group, and its consumption preferences
and aspirations are likely to determine the direction of China’s
future consumption to a large extent,” Hao Hong, a Beijing-
based global equity strategist, wrote in a report. “This
secular trend, with increasing policy support from the top, is
bullish for consumer sectors.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
