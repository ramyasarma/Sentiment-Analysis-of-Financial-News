Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc.,  the insurer that paid back $3.4 billion in federal bailout
money, rose in New York trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
upgraded the insurer to neutral from sell.  Hartford advanced 75 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $24.70 at
10:11 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Goldman Sachs raised the company’s rating because it said
Hartford’s management had a “greater command” of its capital
needs and was reducing costs. Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee , hired a year ago, returned Hartford to profitability in
the last three months of 2009.  “While we believe HIG remains a ‘show me story,’ valuation
is overly compelling,” the investment firm said in a note,
referring to the stock ticker of Hartford, which is based in the
Connecticut city of the same name.  Principal Financial Group Inc. , the Des Moines, Iowa-based
life insurer, rose 70 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $27.77 after
Goldman upgraded it to buy from neutral because of anticipated
improvement in its market share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
