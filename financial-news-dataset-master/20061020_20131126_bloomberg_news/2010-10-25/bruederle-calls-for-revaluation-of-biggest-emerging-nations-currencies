German Economy Minister Rainer
Bruederle called on “important developing nations” to revalue
their currencies as a contribution to promoting global trade.  “A race to devalue currency or one-sided interventions are
not necessary to secure the functioning of world trade,”  he
said in an e-mail today following a meeting of German foreign
policy experts in Berlin. “A further fundamental revaluation of
the currencies of important developing nations could help the
recovery process and is good for the global economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
