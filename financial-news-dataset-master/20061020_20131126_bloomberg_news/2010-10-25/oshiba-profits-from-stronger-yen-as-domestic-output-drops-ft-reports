Toshiba Corp.’s first-half operating
profit benefited by 4.2 billion yen ($52 million) as it reduced
Japanese production and procurement because of the stronger yen,
the Financial Times said, citing President Norio Sasaki.  The industrial group made about 700 million yen for each
one yen increase against the dollar in the six months ended
Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 800 million yen for each yen
increase last year, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
