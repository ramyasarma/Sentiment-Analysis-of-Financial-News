The global aluminum surplus may
narrow by 23 percent in 2011 from this year as consumption may
grow at a faster pace than supply, led by demand from emerging
markets, Japanese trading company  Marubeni Corp . said.  The surplus of primary aluminum will decrease to 1.3
million metric tons from 1.69 million estimated for this year,
Marubeni said in a report today. Global demand is forecast to
expand 7.5 percent, outpacing 6.2 percent growth in supply.  Demand for the metal used in cars and houses will keep
growing on strong consumption by China,  Brazil  and other
emerging economies, while production expansion may slow because
of a lack of new projects by major producers, said Yutaka
Ishibashi, general manager at Marubeni’s light metals section.  “The global aluminum market may become balanced as early
as 2013 as growth in demand will probably outpace supply,” he
told reporters in Tokyo today.  An aluminum surplus in  China , the largest producer and
consumer, is forecast to narrow by 44 percent to 61,000 tons
next year as output will be curbed by energy saving, he said.  “China’s influence on the global market will be almost
neutral” as the nation is unlikely to import or export a
substantial volume of the metal, Ishibashi said.  Marubeni forecast aluminum for delivery in three months on
the London Metal Exchange will trade between $2,200 and $2,500 a
ton in the first quarter of next year, compared with this year’s
average of $2,200. The price may move in a range of $2,200 to
$2,600 in the second quarter, it said.  Following are details of Marubeni’s forecasts for primary
aluminum supply and demand. Figures are in 1,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
