Poland’s government wants the buyer
of its 51 percent stake in  Enea SA , the country’s third-largest
power utility, to bid for 100 percent of the company.  The ministry is still in talks with potential bidders about
the buyout and other conditions,  Maciej Wewior , a spokesman for
the Treasury Ministry, said by phone today.  GDF Suez  SA plans to bid for 100 percent of Enea if it’s
chosen to buy the stake, two people familiar with the matter
told Bloomberg News on Oct. 22. Kulczyk Holding SA, owned by
Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk, is the other bidder. Enea is
valued at about 10.3 billion zloty ($3.7 billion) on the Warsaw
Stock Exchange.  “The fact that the Treasury is expecting a buyer to bid
for 100 percent of Enea may give GDF Suez a slight advantage,
just because of its financial muscle,”  Arkadiusz Chojnacki  of
Ipopema Securities in Warsaw said by phone today. “But I expect
that Kulczyk Holding will also bid for the entire company, and
it also has the backing of Enea employees.”  Marta Wysocka, a spokeswoman for Kulczyk Holding, declined
to comment on the company’s plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
