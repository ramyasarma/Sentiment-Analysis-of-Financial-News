Omeros Corp.  rose in Nasdaq trading
after Vulcan Capital, billionaire  Paul Allen ’s investment group,
invested $20 million in the Seattle biotechnology company that
is developing drugs to treat inflammatory and nervous-system
disorders.  Omeros will also receive a $5 million grant from the state
of Washington’s Life Sciences Discovery Fund, according to a
company statement today. Vulcan and the life sciences fund will
receive a percentage “in the mid-teens” from any sales
generated by the drugs, as well as stock warrants, according to
the statement. Omeros gained 93 cents, or 13 percent, to $8.23
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite
trading.  The funds from Vulcan and Washington state will support
Omeros’s research to identify promising compounds that home in
on a class of common drug targets known as G protein-coupled
receptors, or GPCRs. Omeros’s most-advanced experimental drugs
are designed to treat inflammation during surgery, according to
the Omeros  website .  “Omeros’s GPCR platform has the potential to accelerate
new pipeline development across a broad range of highly
attractive drug targets and can make a significant impact,”
 Steve Hall , Vulcan Capital’s managing director, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
