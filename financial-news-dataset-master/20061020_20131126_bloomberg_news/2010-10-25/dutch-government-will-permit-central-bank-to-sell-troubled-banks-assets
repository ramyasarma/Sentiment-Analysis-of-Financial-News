Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  is preparing a draft bill allowing the country’s central
bank to sell assets of troubled lenders and insurers without
shareholders’ approval.  “The recent financial crisis has revealed significant
weaknesses in the framework,” De Jager wrote in a  letter  to
parliament in The Hague today. “The improvement of the
framework for crisis management has a high priority for me.”  The Dutch central bank, led by  Nout Wellink , is in favor of
the proposed changes, which would allow it to take control of a
troubled financial company and transfer shares, assets or
liabilities to another firm or the government without approval
from a general meeting of shareholders.  The central bank used an emergency procedure last year to
take control of  DSB Bank NV , based in Wognum, northern
Netherlands, following a run on its deposits. DSB was declared
bankrupt in October last year after its owner, former Dutch
policeman Dirk Scheringa, failed to find a buyer.  The proposed change “creates an alternative to the
financial reorganization option in the emergency procedure,
which has proven ineffective,” Wellink wrote in a  letter  to De
Jager dated Oct. 5.  New legislation should prevent companies from canceling
contracts with financial institutions that are taken over by the
government, as this may frustrate a restructuring, the central
bank said.  The Finance Ministry will publish the proposal and seek
public feedback next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
