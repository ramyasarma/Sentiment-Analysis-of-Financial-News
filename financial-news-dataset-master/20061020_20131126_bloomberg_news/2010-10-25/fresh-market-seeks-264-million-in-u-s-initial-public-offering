Fresh Market Inc. , a retailer that
sells premium perishable foods, will seek to raise as much as
$264 million in a U.S. initial public offering on Nov. 4.  The grocer will offer 13.2 million shares at $18 to $20
each with an overallotment option of 1.98 million shares,
according to a  filing  today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fresh Market is planning to sell shares at a time when the
U.S. IPO market is rebounding. Last week, five of the six
offerings posted gains of at least 13 percent in their first day
of trading, as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose above its
highest close since September 2008. Six more IPOs are scheduled
for this week, with companies seeking to raise as much as $1.1
billion, the most since July.  All the shares in the offering are being sold by company
shareholders, and Fresh Market won’t receive any proceeds from
the sale, the prospectus showed. Directors and executives
account for 84 percent of the grocer’s shares up for sale, with
Chairman and founder Ray Berry, 70, selling 3.5 million shares
to trim his holding to 18 percent from 30 percent.  Fresh Market’s  net income more than doubled to $49.2
million between 2005 and 2009. The retailer posted a profit of
$30.2 million in the first six months of this year. Fresh Market
carried $93.8 million of long-term debt as of June 27, the
filing showed.  Plans to Expand  The grocer, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, opened its
first store in 1982 and now has 100 locations in 20 states,
mainly in the Southeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions and
focusing on fresh produce, according to the prospectus. Fresh
Market has tripled the number of stores since 2000 and plans to
continue expanding, estimating the U.S. market can accommodate
500 of its outlets, the share-sale document said.  Fresh Market will trade on the  Nasdaq Stock Market  under
the ticker TFM.  Bank of America Corp. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are leading the offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
