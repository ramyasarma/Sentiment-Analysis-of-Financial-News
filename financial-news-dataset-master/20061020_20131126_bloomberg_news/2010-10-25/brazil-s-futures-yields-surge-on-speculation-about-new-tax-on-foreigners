(Corrects name of economist in third paragraph.)  Brazil’s real weakened after Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega  said yesterday he’s ready to take
additional measures to stem the currency’s rally and has “large
caliber” weapons that haven’t been used.  The real fell 0.6 percent to 1.7059 per dollar at 1:11 p.m.
New York time.  “The fear of intervention is the main market driver today,”
 Luis Otavio de Souza Leal , chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil
SA, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  The government this month tripled to 6 percent a tax on
foreigners fixed-income purchases. It also raised to 6 percent
from 0.38 percent the so-called IOF tax foreigners must pay to
invest in local derivatives.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due January
2012 fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 11.34
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
