Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of the
“The Black Swan,” said bonuses to financial executives and
traders should be “symmetric” with their performance to solve
the problem of overconfidence in global markets.  Taleb, a New York University professor, said “flawed
incentives” caused employees to take ill-advised risks, a
practice that led to the financial crisis.  “Make capitalism the way it’s got to be, symmetric,”
Taleb said today in New York at the  Buttonwood Gathering  hosted
by The Economist. “If you make money, you get paid. If you lose
money, you take away that free option from the system. Take away
the asymmetry.”  In his 2007 best-seller, “The Black Swan: The Impact of
the Highly Improbable,” Taleb describes how unforeseen events
can agitate markets. The title comes from the ancient
misconception that all swans were white.  To contact the reporter on this story:
