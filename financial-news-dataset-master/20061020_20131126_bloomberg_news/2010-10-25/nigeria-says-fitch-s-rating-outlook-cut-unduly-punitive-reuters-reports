Nigerian Finance Minister Olusegun
Aganga said Fitch Ratings’ action to reduce the outlook on the
country’s sovereign credit rating was “unduly punitive,”
Reuters reported, citing a statement from Aganga.  The government disagrees with Fitch’s move “given the
numerous positive features of the country’s economy and ongoing
reforms,” the news agency quoted Aganga as saying.  Fitch cut the outlook on Nigeria’s BB- rating to
“negative” from “stable” because of withdrawals from the
Excess Crude Account and a drop in foreign currency reserves.
Nigeria is in the process of selling its first Eurobond of $500
million.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
