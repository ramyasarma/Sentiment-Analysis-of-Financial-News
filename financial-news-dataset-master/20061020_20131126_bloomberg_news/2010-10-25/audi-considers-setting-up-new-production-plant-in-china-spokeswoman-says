Volkswagen AG ’s Audi luxury unit may
add a new factory in China as a plant in Changchun won’t suffice
to back the carmaker’s expansion in the world’s largest auto
market.  Audi has a goal of delivering one million cars and sport-
utility vehicles in China, where it outsells rivals such as
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and  Daimler AG ’s Mercedes-Benz, in
the next three years alone, spokeswoman Andrea Seltmann said
today by phone. Audi aims to boost Chinese sales by more than a
quarter to more than 200,000 units this year.  “It’s clear that over the long-term, our capacities in
China won’t suffice,” Seltmann said, referring to Changchun,
where Audi only last year raised production capacity to 300,000
units. There’s no decision yet on the new factory, she added.  Audi, whose nine-month Chinese sales surged 61 percent to
174,907, is targeting worldwide record sales of more than 1.08
million units this year, a rise of 14 percent from 2009. The
carmaker aims to introduce a dozen models in 2010, including the
A1, Audi’s smallest vehicle, and a coupe dubbed the A7, as it
increases the lineup to 42 vehicles by 2015 from 34 last year.  Audi currently produces extended versions of the A4 and A6
 models  and the Q5 SUV in Changchun, northeast China, which is
operated by VW and its Chinese partner FAW Volkswagen Automotive
Company Ltd. Audi aims to increase the number of Chinese dealers
to more than 400 by 2013 from 157, according to Seltmann.  BMW, Mercedes  BMW and Mercedes each introduced long-wheel-base versions
of their mid-sized luxury sedans this year to challenge Audi and
tap growing demand for prestige cars from China’s wealthy. The
extended BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class models are designed
specifically to appeal to Chinese customers, who are typically
chauffeured.  BMW also plans to add smaller models to its Chinese lineup
and will start a vehicle-leasing business in 2012, as it aims to
unseat Audi as the market leader in  China . The company is
expanding capacity in China and will be able to build as many as
300,000 vehicles annually by 2013, more than triple its sales in
the country last year.  Daimler  is targeting sales of 300,000 Mercedes-Benz
passenger cars in China by 2015. The world’s second-largest
luxury carmaker has grown at a faster pace in China than Audi
and BMW in recent months. Mercedes’s China sales surged 98
percent to 13,500 vehicles in September, while BMW deliveries
jumped 89 percent to 15,379 and Audi posted a 45 percent gain to
22,125 autos.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
