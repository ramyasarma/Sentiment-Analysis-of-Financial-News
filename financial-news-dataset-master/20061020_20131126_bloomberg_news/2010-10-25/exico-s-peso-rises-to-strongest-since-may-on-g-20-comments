Mexico’s peso bonds rose as yields
on U.S. Treasuries fell, leading investors to seek higher-
yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent bond due in 2024 fell 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.35 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA, at 5 p.m. New York time. The
price rose 0.24 centavo to 133.97 centavos per peso. The yield
has plunged 192 basis points this year.  “Rates continue to fall in the U.S. and the peso continues
to look attractive,” said  Jorge Perez-Duarte , a managing
director for emerging markets at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto.  Yields on benchmark U.S. Treasuries due in August 2020 were
little changed at 2.563 percent, after falling 2 basis points
earlier. The U.S. purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s
exports.  The peso dropped 0.2 percent to 12.3612 per dollar, from
12.3372 on Oct. 22. The decline pared the currency’s gain to 5.9
percent this year.  The peso earlier reached 12.2642, the strongest level since
May 4, as the Group of 20 nations said they would refrain from
“competitive devaluation” and let markets set foreign-exchange
values, as speculation grows the Federal Reserve may act to spur
economic growth. The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.3983 per
euro.  “The comments from the G-20 urging markets to avoid
intervening were pretty strongly worded,” said  Omar Martin del Campo , a trader at Banco Ve Por Mas SA in Mexico City.  The peso is at risk of becoming overvalued because of
market-friendly trading rules that may attract investors
avoiding nations that are imposing steps to curb currency gains,
said  Guillermo Ortiz , former Mexican central bank governor.  “The risk is that we’re the only ones with no barriers to
entry, and they could flood us more and the currency could
appreciate to excessive levels,” Ortiz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
