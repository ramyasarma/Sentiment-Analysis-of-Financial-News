UniCredit SpA,  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA 
and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA may cut dividends to
avoid holding rights offerings to meet new banking capital
standards, the Financial Times said, citing an unnamed senior
bank executive and a director.  Cutting dividends may be politically sensitive in Italy,
where local banking foundations continue to hold stakes in the
country’s biggest banks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
