Spain’s  producer prices  rose the
most in four months in September as the cost of crude oil
increased.  Prices  of goods leaving Spain’s factories, mines and
refineries rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with
2.7 percent in August, the  National Statistics Institute  in
Madrid said today. From the previous month,  prices  rose 0.2
percent, after increasing 0.1 percent in August.  Crude-oil prices rose 13 percent in the 12 months to the
end of September, stoking inflation across Europe. The Spanish
 economy  emerged from an almost two-year recession in the first
half, led by a  surge  in exports.  The cost of producing energy-related goods rose 9.1 percent
from a year earlier, compared with 7 percent in August, the
statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
