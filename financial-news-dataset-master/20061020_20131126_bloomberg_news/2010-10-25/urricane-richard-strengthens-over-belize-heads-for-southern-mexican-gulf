Tropical Storm Richard weakened to a
tropical depression over Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and is
expected to continue to break up as it moves toward the Bay of
Campeche, according to the National Hurricane Center.  The system was moving west-northwest at about 8 mph and was
about 145 miles (233 kilometers) south of Campeche, Mexico, at
about 10:30 a.m. East Coast time, the  hurricane center  said. It
has maximum sustained winds of 35 mph.  “The U.S. interests in the energy infrastructure do not
need to worry at all about this storm,” said  Jim Rouiller ,
senior energy meteorologist for Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn,
Pennsylvania. “The environmental conditions over the Gulf are
hostile. It won’t strengthen, it will die a slow death.”  Richard developed into a tropical storm last week over the
western Caribbean before growing into a hurricane and going
ashore in Belize over the weekend. At its peak it was a Category
1 hurricane, the weakest on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale,
with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, according to the
hurricane center.  The system will probably dissipate in the next 48 hours,
the hurricane center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
