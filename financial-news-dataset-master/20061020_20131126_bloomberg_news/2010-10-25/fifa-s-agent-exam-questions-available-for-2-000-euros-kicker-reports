German soccer magazine  Kicker  said
it was able to buy answers to FIFA’s test for player agents
before soccer’s governing body held the exam.  A Kicker reporter paid 2,000 euros ($2,800) to an
unidentified man and received 15 answers in a text message a few
hours before the exam, the magazine said in a summary of a
longer report. Prospective agents have to answer the 14 of 20
questions correctly to pass and obtain a FIFA agent’s license,
Kicker reported.  FIFA didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking a comment.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:  Mike Gavin
