The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell to the lowest levels in more
than five months as Group of 20 finance chiefs pledged to avoid
a currency war.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased as
much as 15 basis points to 444, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. prices, the lowest since May 3. The index was at 448 at
10:30 a.m. in London.  Finance ministers agreed in talks ended Oct. 23 to avoid
weakening currencies to spur growth, easing the threat of
protectionism and trade imbalances that could hobble the global
economic recovery. Vows to refrain from “competitive
devaluation” increased speculation that the Federal Reserve
will announce another round of bond purchases next week.  “The G-20 has at least moderated some of the potential of
the clear and present danger of a currency war,” said  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
London. “The market has reacted positively to it.”  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 3 basis points to 96, JPMorgan
prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from default was
unchanged, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks
and insurers holding at 123.5.  Credit-default swaps on Portugal fell 5 basis points to a
six-week low of 338 basis points, while contracts tied to
Italian bonds declined 3 basis points to 169 basis points,
according to data-provider CMA. Swaps on Ireland fell 2.5 basis
points to 426 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
