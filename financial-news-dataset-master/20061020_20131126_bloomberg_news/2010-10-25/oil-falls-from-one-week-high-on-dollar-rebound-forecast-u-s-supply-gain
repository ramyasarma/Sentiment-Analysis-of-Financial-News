Oil traded near a one-week high in
New York after the dollar gave up gains against the euro,
bolstering the appeal of raw materials to investors.  Futures earlier dropped as much as 0.6 percent before an
Energy Department report tomorrow that may show crude
inventories rose 1.5 million barrels last week, according to a
Bloomberg News analyst survey. Gasoline supplies probably
climbed by 625,000 barrels, the analysts’ estimates show.  “The markets are being dominated by moves in currencies,”
said  David Taylor , a market analyst at CMC Markets Ltd. in
Sydney. “We’re seeing broad shifts in money and risk
appetite,” he said.  The December contract was at $82.47 a barrel, down 5 cents,
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
12:23 p.m. in Sydney, after falling as much as 47 cents to
$82.05. Yesterday, it advanced 83 cents to $82.52, the highest
close since Oct. 18. Prices are up 3.9 percent this year.  Tropical Depression Richard, moving northwest over Mexico’s
Yucatan Peninsula, will disintegrate in the next day or two and
probably won’t regain strength in the Gulf of Mexico, according
to forecasters.  The system was about 55 miles (89 kilometers) southeast of
Ciudad del Carmen at about 4:30 p.m. East Coast time, the
National Hurricane Center said. It had maximum sustained winds
of 35 mph and was moving at 9 mph toward the Bay of Campeche.  G-20 Pledge  The dollar traded little changed at $1.3959 after gaining
as much as 0.4 percent. G-20 officials, who ended talks in South
Korea on Oct. 23, vowed to avoid weakening currencies to lift
exports. They pledged to refrain from “competitive
devaluation” and to let markets set foreign-exchange values.
Members will meet again in Seoul on Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.  Workers at three French oil refineries voted to return to
work as a contested pension bill neared parliamentary approval
and the government warned that fuel shortages were hurting the
economy. The nation’s eight remaining active plants are either
on strike or shut because of a lack of crude.  U.S. supplies of distillate fuel  probably decreased  for a
fifth week as distributers took deliveries before winter and
exports to Europe increased, the Bloomberg News survey shows.  Brent crude for December settlement traded at $83.52 a
barrel, down 2 cents, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Yesterday it rose 58 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $83.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
