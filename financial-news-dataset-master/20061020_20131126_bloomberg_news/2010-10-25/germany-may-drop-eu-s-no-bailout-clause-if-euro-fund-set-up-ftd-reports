The German government may be
prepared to dump the “no bailout” clause in the European
Union’s governing treaty so that a permanent rescue fund can be
established to protect the euro, the  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Unless the clause is changed, a future fund created by EU
or euro-region governments to help countries in times of crisis
couldn’t be used, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
