The yen will probably trade near to
its strongest-ever level against the dollar after Group of 20
officials failed to discourage investors from selling the U.S.
currency, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. said.  “The main victim in the resumption of dollar selling from
this point may well be Japan,”  Derek Halpenny , European head of
currency strategy in London, wrote today in an e-mailed note.
There is likely to be “an imminent test of the record low
without some renewed aggressive intervention” by the Japanese
administration, he wrote.  The yen appreciated 1.1 percent against the dollar to
80.50, approaching the record 79.75 set in 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
