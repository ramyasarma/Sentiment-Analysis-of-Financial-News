Auburn University moved to No. 1 in
college football’s Bowl Championship Series standings, with the
University of Oregon second and Boise State third.  Auburn was fourth last week in the season’s first BCS
rankings, which determine the two schools that will play in the
Jan. 10 national championship game in Glendale, Arizona.  The Tigers (8-0) jumped to No. 1 with their 24-17 win over
then-No. 6 Louisiana State coupled with Oklahoma’s 36-27 loss to
Missouri. The formerly top-ranked Sooners (6-1) fell to ninth in
the latest BCS standings.   Auburn has a rating of .937 out of 1.000 in the standings,
which are determined using the USA Today coaches’ poll, the
Harris Interactive computer rankings. Oregon (7-0) has a BCS
average of .907 while Boise State (6-0) is at .885.  Texas Christian (8-0) is fourth in the rankings, followed
by Michigan State (8-0), Missouri (7-0), defending champion
Alabama (7-1), Utah (7-0), Oklahoma (6-1) and Wisconsin (7-1).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
