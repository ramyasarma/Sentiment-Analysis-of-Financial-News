China withdrew from the Tokyo
International Film Festival in a dispute over how the delegation
from Taiwan would be introduced, the Global Times newspaper
reported today, citing Jiang Ping, head of the Chinese
delegation.  The Chinese delegation had asked for the group from Taiwan
to be introduced as “Chinese Taipei” or as “China’s Taiwan,”
the Beijing-based newspaper reported. Festival organizers
instead decided to introduce the delegations as China and
Taiwan, prompting the Chinese delegation to withdraw from the
event, according to the report.  China views Taiwan as a renegade province to be united with
the mainland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
