Latvia’s next governing coalition
will contain two parties after a nationalist party was blocked
from joining by a wing in Prime Minister  Valdis Dombrovskis ’s
Unity party.  Society for a Different Politics, one of the three groups
that makes up Unity, “used its right of veto” to prevent For
Fatherland/All for Latvia, a nationalist party, from joining the
government, Unity said in a  press release . That leaves the Union
of Greens and Farmers as the only other coalition member.  Dombrovskis who earlier sought a four-party government with
92 votes in the 100-seat parliament, will control 55 seats.
Harmony Center, which represents the country’s Russian-speaking
minority with 29 votes, withdrew from talks before the
nationalists were blocked.  The next government will have to implement austerity
measures in 2011 and 2012 as the country recovers from its worst
recession on record. Latvia slashed spending and raised taxes to
meet the terms of a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.5 billion) bailout led
by the International Monetary Fund.  Unity won 33 seats in the Oct. 2 election, with the Union
of Greens and Farmers garnering 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
