The National Football League asked
 Cablevision Systems Corp.  to enter binding arbitration to get
the league’s television channel to the cable company’s 3 million
subscribers.  Steve Bornstein , the  NFL Network’s  chief executive, said
Cablevision supports binding arbitration to end a dispute with
 News Corp.’s Fox  that has kept that channel off the cable system
for about two weeks.  James Dolan , Bethpage, New York-based
Cablevision’s chief executive, should agree to use the same
process with the NFL, Bornstein wrote in a letter to Dolan.  “I’m encouraged to hear that Cablevision supports binding
arbitration and would recommend that approach in our own
discussions with you for carriage of NFL Network,” Bornstein
wrote in the letter, which was distributed by the league.  Bornstein said he’ll call Dolan this week, and he hopes the
two companies can resolve the dispute before the NFL Network
airs the first of eight live games beginning on Nov. 11.  The NFL Network, which appears in about 60 million homes on
300 cable and satellite systems, is carried by distributors
including  Comcast Corp. ,  DirecTV ,  Dish Network Corp.  and  Cox
Communications Inc. , the NFL said.  The New York Post reported the story today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
