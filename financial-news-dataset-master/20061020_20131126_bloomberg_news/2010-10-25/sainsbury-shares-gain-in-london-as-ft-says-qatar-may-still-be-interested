J Sainsbury Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest supermarket owner, rose in London trading after the
Financial Times reported that the Qatar Investment Authority may
still be interested in acquiring the retailer.  “Everybody is interested in Sainsbury, but everybody wants
the right price,” Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani told the
newspaper in an interview. The QIA is the London-based company’s
biggest shareholder with a 26 percent stake.  Qatar’s sovereign fund failed in a 2007 bid approach for
Sainsbury after the retailer’s pension fund demanded more cash
and its founding family opposed loading the company with debt.
Speculation surrounding the largest stakeholder has continued to
resurface since then, fueling share price fluctuations.  Sainsbury  rose  as much as 10.4 pence, or 2.7 percent, to
394.9 pence in London and traded at 393 pence as of 9:33 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
