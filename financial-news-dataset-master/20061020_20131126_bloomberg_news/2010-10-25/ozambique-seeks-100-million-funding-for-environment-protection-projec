Mozambique is seeking $100 million
to start a biodiversity fund over the next 10 years, deputy
Environmental Affairs Minister Ana Paula Chichava said.  The fund, to be known as BioFund, will be an independent
body created with support from the World Wide Fund, the African
Development Bank, the World Bank, KfW Bankengruppe and the
government of Mozambique.  “BioFund Mozambique will be an independent environmental
foundation which aims to support the conservation of aquatic,
marine, coastal and terrestrial biodiversity and the sustainable
use of natural resources,” Chichava told Bloomberg News in
Nagoya, Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
