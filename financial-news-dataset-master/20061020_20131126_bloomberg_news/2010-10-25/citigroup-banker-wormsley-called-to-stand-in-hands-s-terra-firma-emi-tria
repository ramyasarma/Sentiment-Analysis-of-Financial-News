The Citigroup Inc. banker accused of
misleading Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. founder  Guy Hands 
about the 2007 auction of  EMI Group Ltd.  was called to testify
in federal court in Manhattan.  A lawyer for Hands and London-based Terra Firma called the
banker,  David Wormsley , to the stand today.  Hands claimed in his own testimony that Wormsley misled him
about the auction of London-based EMI, leading Terra Firma to
overpay for the 113-year-old music company. Wormsley’s lawyers
have contradicted Hands’s account of three crucial phone calls
between them in May 2007, according to court papers.  The calls, which took place the weekend before the auction,
are at the center of Terra Firma’s suit. Hands claims Wormsley,
his former friend and business associate, told him that Cerberus
Capital Management LP planned to submit a competing bid for EMI.
In fact, New York-based Cerberus had withdrawn from the bidding,
leaving Terra Firma without competition.  The case is Terra Firma Investments (GP) 2 Ltd. v.
