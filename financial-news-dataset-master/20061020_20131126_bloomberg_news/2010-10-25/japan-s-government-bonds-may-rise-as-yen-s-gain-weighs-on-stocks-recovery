Japan’s 10-year government bonds may
rise for the first time in three days on prospects the yen’s
advance to a new 15-year high against the dollar will hamper the
nation’s economic recovery.  Ten-year  yields  may drop from near a two-week high after
Nikkei 225 Stock Average futures fell, trading at 9,400 in
Chicago from 9,430 in Osaka yesterday. The Finance Ministry will
sell 2.6 trillion yen ($32 billion) of two-year notes tomorrow.  “The yen keeps rising against the dollar slowly,”
 Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
wrote today in a note to clients. “This is the best time to
make positions for the bullish bond market in the near future.”  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery traded at
143.49 in London from 143.42 at the 3 p.m. close at the Tokyo
Stock Exchange yesterday. The contract will open for trading at
9 a.m. Tokyo time.  The benchmark 10-year bond hasn’t traded yet today at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The yield on the 0.8 percent bond due September 2020 rose half a
basis point to 0.895 percent yesterday.  Ten-year yields touched 0.9 percent on Oct. 22, matching
the highest since Oct. 8. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The yen reached 80.41 per dollar yesterday, the strongest
level since April 1995, when it climbed to a post-World War II
low of 79.75.  The 0.8 percent bond due in September 2020 closed at 99.13
to yield 0.895 percent yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Yen
Bond Fixing Price. The level is an average rate set at 6:30 p.m.
