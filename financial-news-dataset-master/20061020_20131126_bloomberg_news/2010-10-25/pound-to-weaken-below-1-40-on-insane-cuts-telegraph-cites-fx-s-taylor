The U.K.’s spending cuts are
“insane” and the British pound will slump to below $1.40 as
early as this year,  John Taylor , chief executive officer of FX
Concepts Inc., told the Telegraph newspaper.  “I think what Britain is doing is absolutely insane. The
Conservatives will lose their stomach for this,” the newspaper
quoted Taylor as saying.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  proposed last
week to cut spending by 83 billion pounds ($130.6 billion) to
eliminate the nation’s 156 billion-pound budget deficit. The
pound’s low for the year was $1.4231, reached on May 20, and it
traded at $1.5739 at 11:08 a.m. in Tokyo today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
