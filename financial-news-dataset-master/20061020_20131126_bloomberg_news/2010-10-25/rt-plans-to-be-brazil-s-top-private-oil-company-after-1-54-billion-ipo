HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA 
aims to be Brazil’s largest private oil and gas company in five
years, Chief Executive Officer  Marcio Rocha Mello  said today in
an interview in Sao Paulo.  HRT, which raised as much as 2.62 billion reais ($1.54
billion) in an initial public offering last week, started
trading in Sao Paulo today. It traded at 1,175 reais at 11:04
a.m. New York time, 2.1 percent lower than the 1,200-real IPO
price.  HRT sold stock to finance oil exploration in Brazil’s
Solimoes Basin in the Amazon and offshore Namibia, in southern
Africa. The oil producer plans to invest $1.97 billion in Brazil
and $342 million in Africa through 2014 to boost reserves,
tapping a team of former  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  officials.  DeGoyler & MacNaughton, an oil auditing firm, calculated
HRT’s potential reserves at 1.5 billion barrels of oil and
equivalents in an August study, HRT said in its share sale
prospectus.  Michael Dell’s MSD Capital LP owned 12.46 percent of HRT
before the share sale, the biggest individual holding, according
to the offering’s prospectus. The fund is no longer the biggest
individual holder after the offering, Mello said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
