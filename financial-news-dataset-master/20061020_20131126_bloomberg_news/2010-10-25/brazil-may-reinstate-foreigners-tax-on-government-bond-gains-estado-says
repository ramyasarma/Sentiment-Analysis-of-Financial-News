Brazil may end an exemption from a
capital-gains tax on local government bonds for foreign
investors, O Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing an unidentified
person from the government.  The government may send a bill to congress to end the
exemption if an increased tax on foreigners’ purchases of
certain securities fails to curb the appreciation of the real,
the newspaper said. The measure has to be approved by congress
by the end of the year to take effect in 2011, Estado said.  Foreign investors paid 15 percent tax on investment income
until 2006, when the government made the exemption to attract
investors, Estado said.  Officials at the Finance Ministry weren’t immediately
available when Bloomberg News called for comment before regular
working hours today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
