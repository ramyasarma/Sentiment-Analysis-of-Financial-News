The extra yield, or  spread , that
investors demand to hold Belgian 10-year bonds over benchmark
bunds narrowed to the least in a week after a sale of 2.75
billion euros ($3.9 billion) of the nation’s securities.  Belgium’s  10-year yield  decreased five basis points to 3.3
percent as of 11:39 a.m. in London, leaving the spread over
German bunds at 83 basis points, the least since Oct. 15, based
on closing prices.  The September 2020 notes were sold at a weighted-average
yield of 3.26 percent and the auction attracted bids for 2.39
times the amount on offer, the Brussels-based debt agency said
today. At the previous auction on Sept. 27, the agency sold the
10-year securities at an average yield of 3.14 percent. The bid-
to-cover ratio on Sept. 27 was 2.55. Belgium also sold bonds due
in September 2013 and in September 2016 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
