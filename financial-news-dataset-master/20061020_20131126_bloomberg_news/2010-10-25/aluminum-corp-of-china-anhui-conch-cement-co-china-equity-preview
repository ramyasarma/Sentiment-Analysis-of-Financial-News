China’s stocks  dropped from a six-
month high, led by consumer companies, on concern an increase in
fuel prices will stoke inflation and that recent gains were
excessive relative to the outlook for earnings.  Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. fell for the first time in
eight days amid concern higher energy costs will curb profit.
 PetroChina Co. , the nation’s second-largest oil refiner, rose 1
percent after the government raised retail gasoline and diesel
prices.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. , the second-biggest
insurer, slid 4.2 percent after a shareholder reduced its stake.  “Inflationary pressure remains after the fuel price
increase,” said  Dai Ming , a fund manager at Shanghai Kingsun
Investment Management & Consulting Co. “Investors will probably
wait to see how inflation will be in coming months before they
act next.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index  slipped 9.88, or 0.3 percent,
to 3,041.54 at the 3 p.m. close. About six stocks rose for every
five that fell on the gauge, which has jumped 15 percent this
month, the best performer among the 89 benchmark indexes tracked
globally by Bloomberg. The  CSI 300 Index  lost 0.4 percent to
3,466.08 today.  The Shanghai Composite, which yesterday closed at its
highest since April 16, is now valued at 20.3 times earnings,
compared with 17 times in early July, according to weekly  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength measure for
the Shanghai measure, measuring how rapidly prices have advanced
or dropped during a specified time period, was at 79 yesterday.
Readings above 70 indicate a price may be poised to fall.  Fuel Prices  The ceiling for gasoline prices will rise by 230 yuan
($34.50) a metric ton today and diesel prices will gain 220 yuan
a ton, the National Development and Reform Commission, the top
economic planner, said yesterday. The NDRC’s last fuel-price
adjustment was in June, when the costs were cut.  Higher gasoline and diesel prices will add to costs for
manufacturers and farmers and increase inflationary risks.
Consumer-price growth quickened to 3.6 percent in September.  An index of  consumer-staples producers  retreated 1.4
percent, the most in almost two weeks and the biggest decline
among the 10 industries of the CSI 300. Moutai, China’s biggest
producer of baijiu liquor by market value, fell 2.3 percent to
169.01 yuan, snapping a seven-day, 9.2 percent advance.  Sichuan
New Hope Agribusiness Co. , a producer of animal feeds, lost 4.3
percent to 19.90 yuan.  While higher fuel charges will affect inflation
expectations “to some extent,” the effect on overall prices
will be “very small,” the planning agency said in a separate
statement yesterday. The stronger value of the yuan reduced the
extent of the increase, it said.  Second-Half Rally  China’s consumer price index in October will be higher than
the growth a month earlier, the China Securities Journal
reported yesterday, citing  Yao Jingyuan , chief economist at the
National Statistics Bureau. Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent in
September, the fastest pace in almost two years, the statistics
bureau said last week.  PetroChina advanced 1 percent to 11.56 yuan. Sinopec
Shanghai Petrochemical Co., a unit of China’s biggest oil
refiner, rose 1.1 percent to 9.10 yuan.  The  Shanghai Composite  has gained 27 percent in the second
half of 2010, rebounding from a 27 percent loss in the first six
months that was spurred by government moves to curb new lending
and limit property speculation. The gauge is still down 7.2
percent this year.  Developers advanced today after  Poly Real Estate Group Co. 
reported a 70 percent increase in third-quarter earnings. Poly
Real Estate, China’s second-largest property company by market
value, jumped 3.3 percent to 14.63 yuan. Gemdale Corp. climbed
0.9 percent to 6.97 yuan.  Ping An  Ping An, China’s second-biggest insurer, slid 4.2 percent
to 64.02 yuan. Shareholder Shenzhen New Horse Investment
Development Co. said it sold 12.8 million shares, reducing its
holdings in Ping An to 4.93 percent from 5.1 percent.  China Railway Construction Corp. , builder of more than half
the nation’s rail links since 1949, slumped 5.2 percent to 7.59
yuan after saying it will book a loss of 4.15 billion yuan on
its Mecca light-rail project, pending compensation talks with
the client.  -- Zhang Shidong . Editors:  Allen Wan ,  Richard Frost   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
