Barclays Capital  sold $26.4 million
of two-month credit-linked notes on bonds issued by the  State
Bank of India  that pay an annualized coupon of 0.9 percent.  The notes pay 0.15 percent in total, and act as an
alternative to dollar deposits, said  Qian Qin , head of emerging-
market structuring at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong where the
notes were structured.  “I don’t think you could find anything to match the 0.9
percent return, for example, on two-month certificates of
deposit in the market,” Qin said. “Consider that  three-month
Libor  is only paying 28 basis points, that’s a 60 basis-point
pickup, and two-month credit risk is really no risk.”  The bonds underlying the notes were issued last year and
pay an annual coupon of 4.5 percent. State Bank of India is
rated BBB- by Standard & Poor’s, one step above non-investment
grade status.  Credit-linked notes are tied to the creditworthiness of a
country or company, and are usually sold to investors who may
have difficulty accessing the underlying bonds. The London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, is an average of rates set
daily by banks and used as a borrowing benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
