Sohu.com Inc. , operator of China’s
fourth most-visited website, said third-quarter profit rose 12
percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as the company increased
sales of online advertising and Internet games.  Net income  increased to $38.7 million, or $1.01 a share,
from $34.4 million, or 88 cents, a year earlier, Sohu said in a
 statement  today. The Beijing-based company was expected to post
a profit of $35.5 million, the average of eight analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 20 percent to $164.1
million, it said.  Sohu sold more display ads and revenue from paid searches
more than doubled as customers increased spending in the world’s
biggest Internet market by users. China’s  online advertising
market  may expand 26 percent to 36.8 billion yuan ($5.5 billion)
next year, Nomura Holdings Inc. estimated this month.  Changyou.com Ltd. , Sohu’s online games unit, said third-
quarter profit rose 20 percent to a record $45.3 million, as
sales increased 25 percent to $85.6 million.  Changyou’s American depositary receipts rose to $32.74 in
Singapore trading today, compared with their closing price of
$32.40 on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Oct. 22.  Sohu   rose  5.2
percent to $65.76 on the NASDAQ stock market on Oct. 22.  Advertising sales jumped 27 percent to $64.5 million, while
sponsored searches more than doubled to $5.4 million, Sohu said.  Sohu  forecast  fourth-quarter revenue may rise to between
$163 million and $168 million. This compares with the $162.9
million average of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sohu, operator of the Sogou search engine, in August,
agreed to sell a minority stake in Sogou to Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
