The TRANSNET und GDBA unions called
on members working for the German national railroad Deutsche
Bahn AG and a number of private railroads to stage Germany-wide
warning strikes on the morning of Oct. 26, 2010. The walkouts
will lead to “considerable disruptions” to service across the
rail network, the unions said in a joint e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
