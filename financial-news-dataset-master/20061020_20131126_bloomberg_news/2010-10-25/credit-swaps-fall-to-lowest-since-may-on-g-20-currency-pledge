Credit-default swaps on Ford Motor
Co. fell to the lowest in more than five years as the automaker
prepares to report third-quarter profit that may be the biggest
in its 107-year history.  Swaps on the second-largest U.S. automaker declined 28.3
basis points to 369.5 as of 3:12 p.m. in New York, the lowest
since March 2005, and those on the company’s finance unit Ford
Motor Credit Co. dropped 22.9 basis points to 261.5, the least
since June 2007, CMA data showed. The Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index slid to the lowest since May, according
to Markit Group Ltd.  “The pricing in the credit-default swaps reflects the
sentiment that Ford is in the best shape it’s been since 2005,”
said  Shelly Lombard , a debt analyst with New York-based Gimme
Credit LLC. “The direction is correct; they’re probably in
better shape than they were in 2005. It’s very positive and
people are expecting a positive number tomorrow.”  Ford  Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s overhaul of the
car model lineup boosted the company’s share of the U.S. auto
market to 15.1 percent of U.S. light-vehicle sales in the
quarter, versus 13 percent two years earlier, according to
Autodata Corp. Moody’s Investors Service raised the Dearborn,
Michigan-based company’s credit rating two levels to Ba2 from B1
on Oct. 8, saying Ford’s operating performance “significantly
exceeded” expectations.  Homebuilders Decline  “The company is well positioned to continue generating
strong earnings and cash flow through 2011, and to further
strengthen its balance sheet,”  J. Bruce Clark , Moody’s senior
vice president, said in the Oct. 8 statement. “At the same time
that the industry’s business practices have become more
disciplined, Ford is coming to market with an exceptionally
strong product portfolio.”  Ford, which trails only General Motors Co. in U.S. auto
sales this year and has $27.3 billion in automotive debt, is two
levels below investment grade. Moody’s said in an Oct. 15 report
that it expects Ford to maintain its speculative-grade rating
for the next 12 months. Ford is scheduled to report  earnings 
tomorrow.  Contracts on homebuilders eased after a report by the
National Association of Realtors showed  sales  of U.S. existing
homes rose in September by the most on record.  Contracts on  Lennar Corp.  fell 17.2 basis points to 479.7
at 11:47 a.m., CMA data show. Swaps on Pulte Group Inc., the
largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, dropped 19.6 basis points
to 390.8 and those on KB Home, the U.S. homebuilder that targets
first-time buyers, fell 17.5 basis points to 463.4, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swaps on Toll Brothers eased 16.7 basis
points to 212 after the largest U.S. luxury-home builder said it
obtained an $885 million revolving line of credit in a “strong
vote of confidence” from its banks as the economy emerges from
the worst recession since the 1930s.  ‘Competitive Devaluation’  The Markit CDX index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, dropped for
the fourth straight trading day, declining 3 basis points to
93.3 basis points as of 4:35 p.m. in New York.  G-20 officials vowed to refrain from “competitive
devaluation” and to let markets set foreign-exchange values, as
speculation increased that the Federal Reserve will announce
another round of quantitative easing to bolster the U.S.
economy. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent.  Credit-default swaps on banks declined, with contracts on
Morgan Stanley falling 11.9 basis points to a mid-price of 155
and those on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. decreasing 10.9 basis
points to 126, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group in New
York. Swaps on JPMorgan Chase & Co. eased 7.4 basis points to 89
and those on Wells Fargo & Co. decreased 9.5 basis points to
107, Phoenix data show.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
