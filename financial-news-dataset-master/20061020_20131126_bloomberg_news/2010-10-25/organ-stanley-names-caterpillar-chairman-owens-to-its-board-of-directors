Morgan Stanley , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named  James Owens  to its board of directors
effective Jan. 1, increasing the board to 13 members.  Owens, 64, will serve on the nominating and governance
committee, New York-based Morgan Stanley said today in a
regulatory filing. He was chief executive officer of Caterpillar
Inc. until earlier this year and serves on the boards of Alcoa
Inc. and IBM Corp., according to a statement.  Owens, who is currently Caterpillar’s chairman, will leave
the company on Nov. 1 as part of its mandatory retirement
policy. He is a member of President  Barack Obama ’s Economic
Recovery Advisory Board, along with  Laura D’Andrea Tyson , who
heads the Morgan Stanley board’s nominating and governance
committee.  “Jim is an outstanding addition to our board as we
continue to pursue disciplined execution in all of our
businesses within a new regulatory landscape,” Morgan Stanley
CEO  James Gorman  said in the statement. “His management
experience and economic expertise will be an asset to the Morgan
Stanley franchise.”  Owens increases the number of independent directors to 10,
according to the filing. Morgan Stanley’s board shrank from 14
to 12 members this year as  Charles Noski  resigned after taking
the chief financial officer job at Bank of America Corp. and as
former Oracle Corp. Co-President  Charles Phillips  didn’t seek
re-election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
