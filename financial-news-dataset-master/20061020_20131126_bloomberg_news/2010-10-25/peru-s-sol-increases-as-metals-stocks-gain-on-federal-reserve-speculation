Peru’s sol rose for the first time
in three days as copper and gold prices climbed and U.S. stocks
rose as the dollar fell amid speculation the Federal Reserve
will announce further bond purchases next week.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7925 per U.S. dollar
at 1:07 p.m. New York time, from 2.7945 on Oct. 22.  Copper and gold, the Andean country’s top exports, gained
as the weakening dollar boosted demand for commodities as
alternative investments.  Higher prices for copper and gains in U.S. stocks spurred
demand for the sol, said  Gonzalo Navarro , head trader at Banco
Santander in Lima. Gains in the currency were tempered by
concern Peru’s central bank may seek to slow appreciation in the
sol by issuing certificates of deposit redeemable in dollars, he
said.  “The fact that the central bank sold certificates on
Friday when the sol was trading at 2.7930 left the market
thinking the bank has raised the floor price at which it will
intervene. That’s why the currency is holding at around these
levels,” Navarro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
