Perpetual Ltd. , the subject of a
A$1.75 billion ($1.73 billion) bid from  KKR & Co. , said it
expects to report underlying profit of A$35 million to A$40
million in the six months to Dec. 31.  “After a brief period of weakness in equity markets in the
second quarter of calendar 2010, markets have risen in recent
months, however investor sentiment remains cautious,” Chairman
 Robert Savage  said in a speech at the company’s annual general
meeting, which was filed to the stock exchange.  Australian asset manager Perpetual yesterday said the bid
from New York-based KKR doesn’t reflect fair value as it agreed
to provide financial information and enter talks with the
private equity group. KKR offered last week to pay as much as
A$40 a share for the company to tap expanding wealth in the
world’s fourth-biggest pool of managed funds.  The purchase of Perpetual, whose shares had slumped almost
two-thirds from a peak in 2007, would be the biggest acquisition
of an Australian fund manager in a decade. Perpetual shares
added 0.6 percent to A$37.90 in Sydney trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
