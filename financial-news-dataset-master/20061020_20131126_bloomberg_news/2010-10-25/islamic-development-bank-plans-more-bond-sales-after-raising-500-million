Islamic Development Bank plans to
issue more Islamic bonds, known as sukuk, next year after the
Saudi Arabia-based multilateral lender sold $500 million of
bonds last week.  “We just issued sukuk couple of days ago, and we will
definitely issue more sukuk next year,” President  Ahmad Mohammed Ali  said in Jeddah today, without providing more details. The
bank will use proceeds from the bond sale to finance
agricultural and energy projects in the Muslim world, he said.  Islamic Development Bank last week priced its five-year
bonds to yield 40 basis points more than the benchmark midswap
rate. CIMB Holdings Bhd., Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc,
Standard Chartered Plc and NCB Capital managed the sale.  Persian Gulf borrowers sold $9.4 billion of bonds in the
three months until the end of September, the most since the
fourth quarter of 2009 when sales totaled $16.1 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Islamic Bank SAQ
sold $750 million of five-year Islamic bonds on Sept. 30. The
Dubai government last month raised $1.25 billion in its first
bond sale since the Dubai World debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
