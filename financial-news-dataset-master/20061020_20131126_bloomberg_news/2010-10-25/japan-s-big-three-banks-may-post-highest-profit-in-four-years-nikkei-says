Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. for the first time in four years may report combined
consolidated net profit of about 1 trillion yen ($12.4 billion)
for the six months ended in September, Nikkei English News
reported, without saying where it got the information.  That’s a three-fold increase from last year as profits
return to levels before the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., Nikkei said.  Sumitomo Mitsui may post a net profit of 400 billion yen,
Nikkei said. Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho are likely to report
profit of more than 300 billion yen each, Nikkei said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
