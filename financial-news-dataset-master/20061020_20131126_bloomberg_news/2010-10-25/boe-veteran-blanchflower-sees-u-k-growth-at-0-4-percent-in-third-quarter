Former Bank of England policy maker
David Blanchflower estimated that the U.K. economy grew 0.4
percent in the third quarter and predicted that second-quarter
output would be revised down.  Growth is going to be “a lot lower, 0.4 percent” in the
third quarter and it “might even be lower than that,”
Blanchflower said today in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see the second quarter
revised down.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
