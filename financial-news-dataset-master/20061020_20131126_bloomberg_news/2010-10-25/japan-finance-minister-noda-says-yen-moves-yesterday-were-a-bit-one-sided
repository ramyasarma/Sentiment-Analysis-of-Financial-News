Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko
Noda said yesterday’s movements in the yen were a bit one-sided

interest.  Speaking to reporters in Tokyo today, Noda also said
authorities in the U.S., Europe and Japan need to cooperate when
watching markets. He didn’t elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
