Hungary’s forint strengthened in its
longest winning streak in a month, leading gains in emerging-
market currencies, after Group of 20 finance leaders said they
will avoid “competitive devaluation” to lift exports.  The forint appreciated as much as 0.9 percent against the
euro and traded 0.7 percent higher at 273.23 as of 10:17 a.m. in
Budapest, its strongest since Oct. 14. Romania’s leu gained 0.5
versus Europe’s common currency and Poland’s zloty added 0.6
percent.  European stocks rose and most currencies worldwide gained
versus the dollar as the G-20 pledge eased fears of a global
trade war and speculation grew that the U.S. Federal Reserve
will announce more asset purchases in November to boost growth.  “We think the first round of the G-20 meetings is
emerging-market positive in that the leader pledged to move
towards ‘market-determined’ exchange rates,” analysts  Gaelle Blanchard  and  Esther Law  at  Societe Generale SA  in London wrote
in a report to clients today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
