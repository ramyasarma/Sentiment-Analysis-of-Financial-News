Anglo Irish Bank Corp. ’s offer to
swap its subordinated debt for new bonds is “tantamount to a
default” because of the penalties inflicted on investors who
refuse to take part, according to ratings firm DBRS.  The lender’s non-senior ratings will be cut one step to D
for “Default” after the lender completes the exchange
announced on Oct. 21, Toronto-based DBRS said in a statement.
The nationalized bank is offering investors 20 cents on the euro
in new bonds to those tendering junior debt, and 1 cent per
1,000-euro face amount for those declining to take part.  “DBRS views the proposed exchange as offering bondholders
limited options,” the ratings company said. “Should the
bondholders reject the proposed exchange, at an 80 percent
discount on tendered notes, they face the risk of significant
burden sharing.”  A spokesman for Anglo Irish in Dublin couldn’t be reached
for comment.  Ireland faces a bill of more than 50 billion euros ($70
billion) to prop up lenders, with Anglo Irish accounting for as
much as 34 billion euros, and wants to ensure the burden is
shared with subordinated bondholders. Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  has vowed to “address the issue” of junior bondholders
taking a loss on their investments in nationalized banks.  Holders of the equivalent of about 370 million euros of
Anglo Irish’s more-junior securities will get a 50-euro or 50-
pound consent fee to give the issuer the right to buy the notes
back at 1 cent for each 1,000 euros of securities, the bank also
said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
