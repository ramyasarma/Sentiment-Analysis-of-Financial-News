The dollar fell to a 15-year low
versus the yen after a Group of 20 pledge to avoid “competitive
devaluation” failed to dispel bets that the Federal Reserve
will debase the greenback by announcing more bond purchases.  The U.S. currency slid against 15 of 16 major counterparts
as investors added to bets that a boost in quantitative easing
will support higher-returning assets. Sterling fell to the
lowest level against the yen since February 2009 as declining
mortgage approvals in the U.K. spurred speculation that the Bank
of England will buy more debt.  “If you look at all the currencies, it’s the dollar that’s
weak and the pound that’s weak,” said  Brian Dolan , chief
strategist at FOREX.com, a unit of the online currency trading
firm Gain Capital in Bedminster, New Jersey. “These are the
only two countries that are talking about quantitative easing.”  The U.S. currency dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 80.41
yen, the weakest level since April 1995, before trading at 80.82
at 5 p.m. in New York, compared with 81.38 on Oct. 22. The
dollar fetched $1.3966 per euro, compared with $1.3954, after
touching $1.4159 on Oct. 15, the weakest level since Jan. 26.
The euro decreased 0.6 percent to 112.87 yen, from 113.53 yen.  The dollar cut its losses against the euro today after an
industry report showed sales of existing homes in the U.S. beat
the median forecast of economists when they rose 10 percent in
September to an annual rate of 4.53 million.  “The catalyst was the U.S. data,” said  Firas Askari , head
currency trader in Toronto at Bank of Montreal. “It’s very hard
to buy euro up here.”  Euro Bets  Figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed on Oct. 22 that traders increased  bets  to
almost the highest level since October 2009 that the euro will
gain against the dollar, indicating that the common currency’s
rally may be poised for a reversal.  The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners including the euro, yen, pound and Canadian
dollar, fell 0.4 percent to 77.160. It rose 0.6 percent last
week in its first five-day gain since Sept. 10.  The gauge of the U.S. currency has dropped 10 percent since
June 30 on rising speculation the Fed will add to asset
purchases to boost the economy in a practice known as
quantitative easing. The Fed is next due to decide on policy at
its Nov. 2-3 meeting.  Colombian Peso  Colombia’s peso declined as much as 0.4 percent to 1,835.60
against the dollar, the weakest level since Aug. 13, after
President  Juan Manuel Santos  said the South American nation will
take measures this week to slow the currency’s advance. Business
associations said in a letter this month that the currency’s
gain threatens jobs and “jeopardizes the Colombian economy’s
positive outlook.”  The peso has rallied 11.7 percent this year in the best
performance versus the greenback among six Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The pound depreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 126.46 yen,
the lowest level in almost two years, as investors speculated
the Bank of England will step up quantitative easing. Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes tracking 10 developed-
world currencies show the pound has fallen 5.1 percent since
July 30, while the dollar has decreased 5.4 percent.  Sweden’s krona rose to its strongest level in three weeks
against the euro and was at almost a two-year high against the
dollar as traders speculated that the central bank will raise
interest rates tomorrow.  ‘Normal Borders’  “With central banks around the globe in focus, the
Riksbank decision might reverberate beyond the normal borders,”
 Matthew Strauss , senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in Toronto, wrote in a research note.  The krona gained as much as 0.6 percent to 9.1837 per euro,
the strongest level since Oct. 1. The currency gained 0.6
percent to 6.5835 versus the dollar after touching 6.5161 on
Oct. 15, the strongest level since September 2008.  The yen remained stronger than 82.88 per dollar, where it
traded on Sept. 15, when Japan acknowledged selling the currency
to help its export-dependent economy. Toshiba Corp. will prepare
ways to withstand an exchange rate of 70, including halting
unprofitable operations, Nikkei English News reported, citing
Toshiba’s president,  Norio Sasaki . The yen appreciated to a
post-World War II record of 79.75 per dollar in April 1995.  “The Japanese are concerned about intervening in the
middle of all these high-level policy meetings,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing director of currency research in New York at
Nomura Holdings Inc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .  To contact the reporter on this story:
