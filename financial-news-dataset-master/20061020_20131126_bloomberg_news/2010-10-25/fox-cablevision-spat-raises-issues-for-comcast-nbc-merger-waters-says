News Corp. ’s programming conflict
with  Cablevision Systems Corp.  raises questions about Comcast
Corp.’s proposed merger with  General Electric Co. ’s NBC
Universal, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters said today.  News Corp.’s Fox pulled programming from Cablevision in a
fight over fees, and “a similar dispute could have broader
implications” if  Comcast  uses its ownership of NBC as leverage
to charge higher prices to other video providers,  Waters , a
California Democrat, wrote to Federal Communications Commission
Chairman  Julius Genachowski . Her letter was released via e-mail.  The FCC and Justice Department are weighing the proposed
acquisition, which would give Comcast, the largest U.S. cable
company, control of the NBC television network, USA Network, 11
cable channels such as MSNBC, and a movie studio.  Jennifer Khoury , a spokeswoman for Philadelphia-based
Comcast, declined to comment on Waters’ letter.  Those linking the Cablevision-Fox dispute to the proposed
merger are engaged in an “incoherent effort” to “distract the
commission” from the transaction’s benefits, Comcast said in a
filing today with the FCC that the company provided by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
