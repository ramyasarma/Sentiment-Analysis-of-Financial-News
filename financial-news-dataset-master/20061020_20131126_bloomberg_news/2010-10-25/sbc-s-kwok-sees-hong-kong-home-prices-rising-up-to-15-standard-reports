Hong Kong home prices will increase
a further 10 percent to 15 percent in the coming year, the
Standard said, citing Donna Kwok, HSBC Holdings Plc economist
for Greater China.  China’s curbs on property speculation and the second round
of U.S. quantitative easing will push more capital into the Hong
Kong real estate market, Kwok said, as cited by the Hong Kong-
based English-language newspaper today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
