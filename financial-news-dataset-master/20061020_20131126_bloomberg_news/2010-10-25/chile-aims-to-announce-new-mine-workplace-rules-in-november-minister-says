Chile’s government probably will
announce changes to health and safety rules by the end of
November, Mining Minister  Laurence Golborne  said after
overseeing the world’s longest mine rescue.  “We’re working on it,” Golborne said today in an
interview at a ceremony held for the 33 men rescued from the San
Jose underground copper and gold mine earlier this month. “For
the small mining companies, we’re going to look at how we can
help them improve safety conditions.”  President  Sebastian Pinera  vowed to improve labor
conditions across Chile, saying in a speech at the presidential
palace today that Chileans have “learned our lesson.”  The owners of Cia. Minera San Esteban Primera SA, the
company that reopened the century-old San Jose mine in response
to higher copper and gold prices, are facing legal proceedings.
Chile’s largest copper mines already comply with the world’s
most stringent health and safety standards.  “Thank God we’re out and we’re free,” Luis Urzua, the
shift supervisor and last man hoisted to freedom after spending
70 days half a mile underground, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
