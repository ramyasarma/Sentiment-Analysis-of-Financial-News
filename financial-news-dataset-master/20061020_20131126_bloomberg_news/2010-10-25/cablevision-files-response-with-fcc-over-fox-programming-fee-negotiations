Cablevision Systems Corp.  said it
filed a response to federal regulators documenting  News Corp.’s 
“bad faith” in negotiations related to a fee dispute that
threatens customer access to World Series baseball games.  The Federal Communications Commission had asked Cablevision
and News Corp. last week to explain how they intend to end the
feud that’s left 3 million customers in the New York and
Philadelphia markets without Fox programs. Responses were due
today.  “The FCC filing clearly demonstrates that News Corp. has
acted in bad faith,”  Charles Schueler , a Cablevision spokesman,
said in a statement today. “News Corp. never engaged in real
negotiations, they only made a ‘take it or leave it’ proposal,
and they timed the Fox blackout to leverage major national
sporting events to force Cablevision to accept unreasonable
demands.”  Fox countered, saying it has negotiated in “good faith”
and never made any “take it or leave it” demands.
Cablevision’s statement is “yet another example of their ploy
to secure an advantage through government intervention,”  Scott Grogin , a Fox spokesman, said in a statement today.  News Corp., led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Rupert Murdoch , cut its Fox signal to Cablevision on Sept. 16
after the sides failed to agree on how much the cable company
should pay for programming. Bethpage, New York-based Cablevision
has called for arbitration to resolve the dispute, a move News
Corp. has refused.  Cablevision says Fox is asking for $150 million a year in
fees, more than it pays for ABC, CBS, NBC and the Spanish-
language Univision combined.  News Corp.  said the $150 million
figure isn’t accurate and that it’s seeking “fair
compensation.”  Cablevision  fell  6 cents to $26.43 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. News Corp., based in New York,
 declined  15 cents to $14.25 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
