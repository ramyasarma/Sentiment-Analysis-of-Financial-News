Ford Motor Co. , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, plans to invest $850 million and add 1,200 jobs
in Michigan by 2013 as sales rebound. The moves are backed by
$400 million in state incentives, Ford said.  Ford will add 900 hourly positions in its factories and 300
salaried jobs at its engineering and manufacturing operations,
the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said today in a statement.
The jobs will be added at plants including Ford’s Van Dyke
Transmission, Sterling Axle, Livonia Transmission and the
Dearborn Truck Plant, the automaker said.  The state of Michigan is supporting Ford with as much as
$400 million worth of tax breaks over 15 years,  Mark Fields ,
Ford’s president of the Americas, told reporters.  “Without bringing a package of job-retention tax
incentives to the table, this kind of investment would have been
much more difficult,” Fields said.  The state board is also set to discuss similar incentives
for Chrysler Group LLC. Proposed amendments are also on the
agenda for affiliates of General Motors Co. and for Hyundai
Motor Co.’s technical center. No amounts were given.  Ford has begun increasing its U.S. workforce as it gains
market share with new models such as the Fiesta subcompact and
Super Duty pickups. The company had agreed to add 1,975 hourly
jobs by 2012 to do work traditionally done by suppliers. That’s
416 more positions than Ford promised in its 2007 contract with
the United Auto Workers union.  Sales Rebound  U.S. car and light truck sales fell to 10.4 million last
year, the fewest since 1982. Ford expects industrywide sales of
11.5 million to 12 million this year. Sales averaged 16.8
million a year from 2000 to 2007. Fields said sales have been
running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12 million
vehicles so far this month, which would be the highest of 2010.  Ford, the only major U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy
last year, may report record third-quarter net income of $1.37
billion tomorrow, based on the average projection of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The automaker ended three years
of losses with a $2.7 billion  profit  last year as the U.S. auto
market fell to the lowest level in 27 years.  Michigan’s economic-development board is scheduled to
discuss retention credits for Ford, according to the agenda for
the meeting, which didn’t list an amount.  “Promoting investments in technologies, facilities and our
workforce ultimately will help revitalize manufacturing in
Michigan and help Ford compete with the best in the business
worldwide,” Fields said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
