Lower corn-yield expectations from
U.S. farmers contributed to a cut in the government’s production
 forecast  that spurred a 6 percent jump in corn prices earlier
this month, a U.S. Department of Agriculture official said.  On Oct. 8, corn prices surged 30 cents a bushel, the most
allowed by the Chicago Board of Trade, after the USDA slashed
its estimate for U.S. production to 12.664 billion bushels, the
second cut in as many months, because of lower projected yields.
The USDA bases its forecasts on farmer surveys and field
samples.  “It seems with some farmers that until they got into the
fields, they were slow to realize maybe this crop wasn’t as good
as what they thought,”  Lance Honig , the chief of the crops
branch of the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service,
said at a data-users meeting in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
