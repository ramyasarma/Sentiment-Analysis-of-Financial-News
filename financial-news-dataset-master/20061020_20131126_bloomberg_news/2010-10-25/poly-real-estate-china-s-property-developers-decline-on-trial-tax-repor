Poly Real Estate Group Co. led
China’s property developers lower in Shanghai and Shenzhen
trading, after a newspaper  report  said the country may start
levying a property tax before March next year.  Poly, the nation’s second-largest publicly traded developer,
dropped 2.9 percent in Shanghai as of 9:43 a.m. while  China
Merchants Property Development Co.  fell 2.7 percent in Shenzhen.
An  index  tracking 34 real-estate companies in Shanghai lost 0.6
percent, compared with a 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark
 Shanghai Composite Index .  The country may start levying the property tax on a trial
basis prior to March, the China Securities Journal reported
today, citing  Nie Meisheng , president of the China Real Estate
Chamber of Commerce. The government said last month it will
speed up the introduction of a trial property tax in some cities
and then expand the levy to the whole country.  Property prices  in 70 cities rose 0.5 percent in September
from the previous month and the value of real-estate sales
surged 56 percent, prompting the government to extend a
crackdown on speculators and multiple home purchases.  China may have more than 100,000 canceled new and existing
home sales in the fourth quarter of the year because of the
latest government curbs on the sector, the 21st Century Business
Herald  reported  today, citing Centaline Property Agency Ltd.  China Vanke Co. , the nation’s largest real estate developer,
said late yesterday third-quarter net income rose 6 percent from
a year earlier to 459.5 million yuan ($69 million) even as sales
dropped 27 percent.  -- Luo Jun . Editors:  Tomoko Yamazaki ,  James Gunsalus   To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
