Economists’ expectations for
Brazilian consumer prices in 2011 held steady last week, as the
real’s appreciation and slower global growth helped restrain the
inflationary impact of credit expansion and record low
unemployment.  Consumer prices in Latin America’s biggest economy will
rise 4.98 percent next year, down from a week-earlier forecast
of 4.99 percent, according to a central bank survey of about 100
economists taken Oct. 22 and published today.  “Demand is growing very fast,” said  Pedro Tuesta , senior
economist for Latin America at 4Cast Inc. in Washington. “The
thing that is keeping inflation under control is the strong
real.”  The central bank is comfortable with the current inflation
outlook and is not planning further increases to its benchmark
Selic rate, Tuesta said.  Inflation should end 2010 at 5.27 percent, compared with a
5.20 percent week-earlier forecast, the survey found. Consumer
prices will rise 5.17 percent over the next 12 months, compared
with 5.16 percent forecast a week earlier, the survey found.
Analysts kept their 2010 and 2011 economic growth forecasts at
7.55 percent and 4.5 percent respectively.  Prices, Selic, Markets  Analysts expect the central bank to resume  interest rate 
increases in 2011 as domestic demand stokes inflation. Policy
makers will increase the benchmark Selic rate to 11.25 percent
in April, and 11.75 percent in June, according to today’s
survey.  Policy makers paused at 10.75 percent at their last two
meetings, after raising it 200 basis points this year from a
record low 8.75 percent.  Yields on interest rate futures contracts maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in Sao Paulo, rose four basis
points to 11.89 percent at 9:15 a.m. New York time. The real
gained 0.2 percent to 1.7020 per dollar.  The real has strengthened 36 percent since the start of
2009, the third-best performer of 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind the Australian dollar and the South African
rand.  Jobs, Credit  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to a record 6.2 percent in
September, from 6.7 in August. The figure was the lowest since
the government began publishing the data in March 2002.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected joblessness of 6.5
percent, according to the median estimate from 36 analysts.  Bank lending expanded in August at its fastest pace since
July 2009, according to central bank figures.  The stock of outstanding credit increased 2.2 percent from
the previous month, led by an increase in mortgage lending,
according to the central bank.  Brazil’s inflation rate through mid-October doubled from
the previous month, led by a 1.7 percent jump in food prices.  Policy makers forecast inflation will slow to 4.6 percent
next year should the benchmark rate remain unchanged at 10.75
percent, according to a Sept 30 quarterly inflation report.  The bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  The bank holds its last monetary policy meeting of 2010 on
Dec. 7-8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
