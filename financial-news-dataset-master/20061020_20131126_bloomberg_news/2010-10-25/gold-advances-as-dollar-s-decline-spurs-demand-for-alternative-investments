Gold futures rose the most in more
than a week as the dollar fell, boosting demand for the precious
metal as an alternative investment. Palladium advanced to a
nine-year high.  The greenback dropped as much as 1 percent against a basket
of major currencies. A Group of 20 pledge to avoid “competitive
devaluation” failed to ease speculation that the Federal
Reserve will make more bond purchases, eroding the value of the
dollar. Gold has gained 22 percent this year, reaching a record
$1,388.10 an ounce on Oct. 14.  “The Fed has put the world on notice that the dollar can
no longer be viewed as a safe-haven currency,”  Michael Pento , a
senior economist at Euro Pacific Capital in New York, said in a
report. “During the next crisis, investors should seek the
safer harbor that is derived from owning commodities and
precious metals.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $13.80, or 1
percent, to settle at $1,338.90 an ounce at 1:55 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since Oct. 13. Last week, the metal tumbled 3.4 percent, the
most since early July.  G-20 officials, ending a meeting in South Korea on Oct. 23,
agreed to refrain from “competitive devaluation” and allow
markets to set foreign-exchange values, seeking to calm trade
tensions. G-20 members will meet again in Seoul on Nov. 11.  “It is safe to sell the dollar on all fronts,”  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-
based Gartman Letter, said after the meeting. “The world wants
to swap dollars for hard assets.”  ‘Physical Demand’  UBS AG said its gold sales on Oct. 22 to India, the world’s
largest buyer, were the third-highest this year.  “At current prices near $1,350, demand will likely pull
back a bit, but should remain healthy” before the Diwali
festival at the beginning of next month,  Edel Tully , an analyst
at UBS in London, said today in a report. “Physical demand at
the levels we saw on Friday is usually an indicator that gold’s
price trough is very near.”  Palladium futures for December delivery rose $17.70, or 3
percent, to $608.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $620, the highest level
since June 2001. The commodity has jumped 49 percent this year,
outpacing gold and other precious metals.  Platinum futures for January delivery gained $21.90, or 1.3
percent, to $1,697 an ounce. The price has climbed 15 percent
this year.  Palladium and platinum are used to make jewelry and
pollution-control devices in cars.  “Palladium has a high exposure to the emerging-markets
auto industry,” said  Bayram Dincer , an analyst at LGT Capital
Management in Switzerland.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 42.6 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $23.544 an ounce on the Comex. The price has
gained 40 percent this year, reaching $24.95 on Oct. 14, the
highest level in 30 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
