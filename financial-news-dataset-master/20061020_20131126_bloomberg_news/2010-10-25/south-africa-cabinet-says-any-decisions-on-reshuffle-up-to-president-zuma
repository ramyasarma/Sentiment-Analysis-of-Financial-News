Any change to the composition of
South Africa’s Cabinet is up to President Jacob Zuma, the
country’s Cabinet said in a statement published on SAPA PR
today.  “Only the President knows whether or not there will be a
reshuffle, what form it would take if there was one, when it
would happen if it is to happen and other details,” the Cabinet
said, saying it had noted ongoing media speculation about a
reshuffle of ministers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
