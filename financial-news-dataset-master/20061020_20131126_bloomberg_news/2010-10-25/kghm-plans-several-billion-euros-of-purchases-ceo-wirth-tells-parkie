KGHM Polska Miedz SA, Poland’s sole
copper producer, wants to buy assets worth “several” billion
euros and expects next year to complete some of planned
takeovers, Chief Executive Officer Herbert Wirth told the
Parkiet newspaper.  The company is in “advanced” talks to buy a copper ore
field in Canada, Wirth said, Parkiet reported.  KGHM may publish guidelines for its 2010 earnings in
November, Parkiet said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
