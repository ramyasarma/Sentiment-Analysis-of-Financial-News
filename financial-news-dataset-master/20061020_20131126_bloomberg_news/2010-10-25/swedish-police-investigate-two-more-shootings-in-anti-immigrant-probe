Two further shootings took place in
the southern Swedish city of Malmoe, where police are hunting a
person believed to target people with immigrant backgrounds,
this weekend, the Swedish police said on its website today.  Shots were fired at a tailor’s workplace on Oct. 23 and
when the victim went out to confront the man, he was assaulted,
police said. Later the same day, shots were fired through a
window of a property on Vaestra Skraevlingevaegen, police said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
