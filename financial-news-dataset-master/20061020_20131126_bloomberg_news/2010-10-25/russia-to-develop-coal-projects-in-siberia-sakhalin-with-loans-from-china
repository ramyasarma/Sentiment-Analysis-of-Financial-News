Russia will pay for coal projects in
Sakhalin Island and Elegest, eastern Siberia, using some of the
$6 billion of loans China gave to the nation to secure supplies.  The countries will reveal some of the developments that
will get funding by the end of the year, Russian Deputy Energy
Minister  Anatoly Yanovsky  told reporters today in Moscow.  China, which uses coal to make steel and to fuel 80 percent
of its power plants, is seeking to boost imports from countries
also including Mongolia and Australia to meet demand. Russia
discussed joint development of coal deposits on Sakhalin with
China, as well as building rail links and an export terminal to
allow for deliveries from the island in Russia’s Far East, the
 Ministry of Energy  said in September last year.  Russia will use the Chinese loans to finance investments by
domestic coal producers in return for a guarantee to increase
supplies to China, it said last month. United Industrial,
controlled by lawmaker  Sergei Pugachyov , holds a permit to the
Elegest field, which contains about 946 million metric tons of
coal. The company said last month it hired Credit Suisse Group
AG to sell a controlling stake in the field for $5 billion.  OAO Mechel , Russia’s biggest producer of coal used for
steelmaking, obtained local financing to develop coal deposits
and won’t use Chinese money, Yanovsky said. The company is
developing the Elga mining project in eastern Siberia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
