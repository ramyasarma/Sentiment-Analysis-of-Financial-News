Brasil Ecodiesel Industria e
Comercio de Biocombustiveis e Oleos Vegetais SA , Brazil’s
biggest biodiesel maker, fell the most in almost a year after
saying it’s in talks to combine assets with farm group Maeda SA
Agroindustrial SA.  Brasil Ecodiesel fell 10 percent, leading losses on the
Bovespa index, to 1.12 reais at 5:02 p.m. New York time in Sao
Paulo trading. The slump is the biggest share decline since Oct.
27 2009.  The company, based in Rio de Janeiro, said it may conclude
the deal by Dec. 31 and that Maeda’s shareholders may receive
one Brasil Ecodiesel share for every 3.6395 shares they own.  “Investors were disappointed by the implicit share price
of the accord,”  Victor Martins , an analyst with Sao Paulo-based
Planner Corretora de Valores, said today in a phone interview.
He estimates the implicit share price of the deal would be 88
centavos. He cut his rating to “neutral” from “buy” after
the statement was released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
