Luxottica Group SpA , owner of the
Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses brands, aims to raise net income
27 percent this year after demand in emerging markets and
renewed interest in luxury eyewear boosted quarterly sales.  Net income may rise to 400 million euros ($561 million)
from  315 million euros  in 2009, Milan-based Luxottica said in a
statement after trading today. That’s in line with a 400.5
million-euro average  estimate  of 12 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  Luxottica, the world’s largest maker of eyewear, returned
to  earnings growth  in the final quarter of 2009 after consumers
deferred purchases for almost two years during the recession.
The company is “optimistic” for the rest of 2010, Chief
Executive Officer  Andrea Guerra  said in the statement.  Third-quarter net income advanced 35 percent to 101.9
million euros, compared with a 98 million-euro average estimate
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales in the three months
ended Sept. 30 rose 20 percent to 1.46 billion euros.  The Italian company, which makes eyewear under license for
Chanel and Prada, said sales in “key emerging markets” rose 26
percent in the quarter, while European revenue advanced 13
percent and U.S.-dollar sales in North America rose 8.5 percent.  Wholesale revenue for luxury brands advanced 18 percent,
the second consecutive quarterly gain, Luxottica said. Wholesale
revenue in emerging markets, which account for about 13 percent
of total wholesale sales for the company, rose more than 20
percent for the fourth straight quarter, with about a 40 percent
increase in India and South Korea.  Luxottica, which owns the LensCrafters and Sunglass Hut
store brands, said retail-division revenue rose to 946.5 million
euros in the third quarter from 793.8 million euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
