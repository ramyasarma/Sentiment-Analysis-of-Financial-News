Kalpataru Power Transmission Ltd., 
backed by Indian billionaire  Mofatraj Munot , plans to build an
electricity towers factory for meeting orders valued at 90
billion rupees ($2 billion) over the next two years.  The plant, to be set up in Raipur in northern Indian state
of Chhattisgarh, will be ready in a year,  Manish Mohnot ,
executive director of the company said in a phone interview from
Gandhinagar in Gujarat state. The plant will have a capacity to
make 30,000 tons of transmission towers, he said without giving
financial details.  Kalpataru, based in Mumbai, is expanding to tap rising
demand from factories and homes in India for power. The
government aims to quadruple power generation capacity by 2030
to sustain expansion in Asia’s second-fastest growing major
economy. The country had 165 gigawatts of capacity as of Aug.
31, according to the  Central Electricity Authority .  Power Grid Corp. of India, the nation’s biggest
transmission company, plans to spend 1 trillion rupees ($22
billion) “in the coming years,” Mohnot said. “That’s how
large the market is in India.”  Shares  of the company, which have declined 18 percent this
year, rose 0.4 percent to 178.5 rupees in Mumbai at 11:44 a.m.
The benchmark Sensitive Index has risen 17 percent this year.  Peak power supply in the country was 10.5 percent, or
12,600 megawatts, less than demand in the six months ended Sept.
30, according to the authority’s website.  The  company  expanded its capacity of its plant in Gujarat
to 108,000 tons from 84,000 tons a year last year, Mohnot said.
About 65 percent of the company’s orders are domestic and the
rest from nations in Africa and Middle East, he said.  The company expects revenue to grow between 15 and 20
percent this fiscal year, Mohnot said.  “In India and abroad a number of generation plants are
being set up and there is a lot of transmission opportunity,”
he said. “A lot of tendering is happening in most of the
African states.”  Munot, who founded Kalpataru, ranks 67 among India’s 100
richest people, with $1.05 billion in wealth, according to
Forbes magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
