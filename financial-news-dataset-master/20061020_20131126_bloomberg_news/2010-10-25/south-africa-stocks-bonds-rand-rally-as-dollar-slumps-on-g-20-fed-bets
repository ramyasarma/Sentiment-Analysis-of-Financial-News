South African stocks, bonds and the
rand gained as the nation’s commodity exports rallied after the
dollar slumped and the Group of 20 pledged to avoid currency
devaluation, reducing concerns of a global trade war.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  rose 144.48, or 0.5
percent, to 30,262.64 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The
rand strengthened 0.2 percent to 6.9225 per dollar.  Gold, which together with platinum accounts for about a
fifth of South Africa’s exports, climbed as a drop in the dollar
boosted investor demand for the precious metal as an alternative
investment. Platinum rallied as much as 1.6 percent to $1,704.75
an ounce.  “The dollar is under pressure so there’s a lot of money
flowing into the local market at the moment,” said  Rudi van der Merwe , chief investment officer at Standard Private Bank Equity
Advisory Services. “The assumption is that the U.S. is going to
continue printing money, which is keeping the dollar weak, so
people are still looking for yield elsewhere.”  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers ended
talks in South Korea on Oct. 23 pledging to refrain from
“competitive devaluation,” and to let markets set foreign-
exchange values as they sought to calm fears of a global trade
war through cheaper currencies.  The dollar slumped versus all but two of its 16 major
counterparts after the G-20 pledge eased concern developing
nations would boost purchases of U.S. currency and on
speculation the Federal Reserve will announce another round of
bond purchases next week and keep borrowing costs near zero.  Government bonds advanced for the first day in five, with
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbing
16 cents to 125.53 rand. The yield on the bond declined four
basis points to 7.20 percent. A basis point is 0.1 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
