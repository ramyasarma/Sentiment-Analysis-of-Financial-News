The International Monetary Fund said
the main risks to growth in Sub-Saharan Africa are the
“fragile” recovery in the global economy and political
instability in some countries.  The region is set to return to its growth rate before the
global financial crisis hit, Abebe Selassie, the IMF’s division
chief for Africa, said in an interview in Kenya’s capital,
Nairobi, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
