India’s 12-year  bonds  fell for a
second day as an increase in money-market rates boosted the cost
of purchasing the notes with borrowed funds.  The securities also dropped on speculation the central bank
will raise benchmark interest rates at a Nov. 2 review to help
cool  inflation . The overnight  rate  at which local banks lend to
each other climbed to 6.9 percent today from 5.75 percent at the
end of last month, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Bonds are lower because liquidity remains tight and the
market is expecting a rate increase at next week’s policy
review,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at Development
Credit Bank in Mumbai.  The yield on the 8.13 percent note due May 2022 climbed one
basis point to 8.11 percent as of 10:26 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.08, or 8 paise per 100 rupee face amount, to 100.16.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
climbed the most in three weeks. The rate, a fixed payment made
to receive floating rates, rose six basis points to 6.70 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
