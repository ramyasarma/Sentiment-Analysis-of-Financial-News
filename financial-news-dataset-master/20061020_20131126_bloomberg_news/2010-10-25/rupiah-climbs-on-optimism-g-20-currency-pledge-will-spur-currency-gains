Indonesia’s rupiah advanced to near
a three-year high on optimism the central bank will tolerate
appreciation after the Group of 20 nations pledged to avoid
weakening their currencies to support growth.  Member countries of G-20, which includes Southeast Asia’s
biggest economy, agreed over the weekend to refrain from
“competitive devaluation” and let markets set foreign-exchange
values. The rupiah has gained 5.2 percent this year,
underperforming rival currencies such as Thailand’s baht and
Malaysia’s ringgit that have climbed 11.5 percent and 10.5
percent, respectively, on speculation Bank Indonesia intervened
to support the dollar.  “The rupiah gained as a result of the G-20 outcome,” said
 Enrico Tanuwidjaja , an economist at OSK-DMG Group in Singapore.
“That suggests this currency war concern should not be over-
emphasized and competitive devaluation will not be desirable.”  The rupiah rose 0.1 percent to 8,928 per dollar against the
dollar as of 8:26 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 8,900 on Sept. 30, its strongest
level since June 2007.  Bank Indonesia intervened in the market to prevent the
rupiah from becoming too strong, Deputy Governor Halim Alamsyah
said in Jakarta on Oct. 22 without elaborating. Central banks
intervene in currency markets by arranging purchases or sales of
foreign exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
