OGI Capital Partners Ltd.  hired
Marcus Blomberg, a former fund manager at  Alfred Berg Asset
Management AB , as a trader to help expand its global macro fund.  Blomberg, 35, will join the firm next month and report to
 Allan Bedwick , who runs the OGI Global Macro Fund, said  Naoya Takahashi , the head of fund management at the Tokyo-based
company said.  Bedwick is growing his team after boosting the fund’s
assets beyond $100 million this year. The fund, which bets on
worldwide stock, bond and currency trends with a focus on Asia,
has preliminarily returned about 7.5 percent this year, compared
with the  Eurekahedge Hedge Fund Index ’s 5 percent as of Sept. 30.  Blomberg was formerly a fund manager at Stockholm-based
 Alfred Berg Asset Management , owned by BNP Paribas Investment
Partners.  Hedge funds are private, largely unregulated pools of
capital whose managers can buy or sell any assets, bet on
falling as well as rising asset prices, and participate
substantially in profits from money invested.  To contact the reporters on this story:
