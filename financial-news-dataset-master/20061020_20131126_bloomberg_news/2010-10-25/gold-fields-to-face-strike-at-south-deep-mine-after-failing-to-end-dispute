Gold Fields Ltd. will face a strike
by the National Union of Mineworkers at its South Deep mine from
tomorrow after the miner failed to reach agreement with workers
who are pushing for more powers in making decisions at the
company.  Gold Fields will seek an interdict against the proposed
strike action, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
