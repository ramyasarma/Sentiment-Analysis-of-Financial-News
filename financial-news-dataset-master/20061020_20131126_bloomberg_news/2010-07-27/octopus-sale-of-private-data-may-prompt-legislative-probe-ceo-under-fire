             Hong Kong lawmakers say they may
investigate the sale of people’s private data by electronic
payment company  Octopus Holdings Ltd. , which provides cards used
by millions of the city’s residents for daily transactions.  
 Octopus Chief Executive Officer  Prudence Chan  should be
fired after denying sales of clients’ personal information
earlier this month and then saying during a hearing held by the
city’s privacy commissioner yesterday that it had happened,
lawmaker  Wong Kwok-hing  said by phone today. Octopus declined to
comment, said a spokeswoman who didn’t give her name citing
company policy. Octopus may release a statement later, she said.  
 Chan told reporters yesterday that Octopus made HK$44
million ($5.7 million) in revenue selling the data since January
2006. Octopus provided 1.97 million customers’ personal
particulars to six companies, including  Cigna Worldwide Life
Insurance Co. , according to Chan’s remarks provided today by the
company in an e-mail.  
 “Chan should be fired even if she doesn’t resign,” Wong
said. “Octopus should sack her to redeem public trust.”  
 Chan, who joined Octopus from Visa International in 2006,
apologized and said yesterday the company would no longer sell
private information of its customers. Information on 1.97
million Hong Kong residents would amount to almost one-third of
the city’s population of 7 million.  
 Octopus cards are used by Hong Kong residents who swipe
them over scanners for transactions such as subway and bus rides
and at fast-food outlets and convenience stores. While the cards
can be purchased for cash, customers who participate in a
rewards  program  with the card must provide personal details.  
 ‘Not Fair’  
 “It’s not fair for our citizens,” said Winney Ho, 33, a
clothing saleswoman. “What they did was wrong. It made me feel
our information is not very secure. I won’t stop using the card
because it’s convenient, but I might participate less in those
reward programs.”  
 Courier Lee Kwok Sing said Octopus should donate the money
it got to charity. “They took our information and sold us,”
said Lee, 69.  
 Hong Kong Chief Executive  Donald Tsang  today expressed
“concern” about the matter, Radio Television Hong Kong  said .  
 The insurer Cigna said in a statement yesterday it was
cooperating “fully” with the Hong Kong privacy commissioner
and “the highest controls and standards have always been
maintained with the limited customer personal data provided by”
Octopus.  
 Wong said he had asked for a legislative investigation to
start in October when lawmakers reconvene. Lawmaker  James To 
said today by telephone he was among those supporting a probe.  
 Octopus is 57.4 percent owned by MTR Corp., which operates
Hong Kong’s underground trains and develops property. MTR
spokeswoman Diana Yue said yesterday that while Octopus operates
independently, MTR as a shareholder expects it to take the
matter seriously and reassure the public.
