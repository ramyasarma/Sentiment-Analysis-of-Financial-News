             Six of October Development &
Investment Co.  climbed to the highest level in almost two weeks
after Al Mal reported the Egyptian luxury property developer
submitted the only acceptable bid for a plot of land in  Sheikh Zayed  City.  
 Six of October, also known as Sodic, advanced 1.1 percent
to 82.52 Egyptian pounds at the close in Cairo, valuing the
company at 3 billion pounds ($520 million).  
 Sodic expects to hear back from the authorities regarding
its technical and financial offers for the land plot before the
end of August, the company’s chief commercial officer  Youssef Hammad  said in a telephone interview.  
 Sodic yesterday submitted the bid to develop a 410 feddan
(426 acres) plot of land adjacent to its flagship Allegria
development on the outskirts of Cairo, Al Mal newspaper reported
today. An offer by rival Palm Hills Developments SAE was
rejected because the company did not pay a security deposit, the
Cairo-based daily said.  
 Bassem El Shawy, investor relations manager for Palm Hills,
declined to comment.
