             Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska 
is in talks to acquire budget carrier  Sky Express  to add flights
in the southern Krasnodar region, where he owns four airports
and a local carrier, two people familiar with the matter said.  
 The deal may be completed within a month, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the talks are
confidential. Sky Express hasn’t disclosed its ownership
structure since 2009, when it was controlled by Vitaly Vantsev,
a shareholder in Vnukovo Airport, the airline’s hub.  
 Deripaska is seeking to develop air travel in his native
Krasnodar, a region the size of Austria between the Black and
Caspian seas that includes Sochi, the host city of the 2014
Winter Olympic Games. He owns the main airports in the regional
capital Krasnodar, and the Black Sea resorts of Sochi,
Gelendzhik and Anapa.  
 Sky Express earned 3.5 billion rubles ($116 million) of
revenue last year carrying 1.11 million passengers on nine
Boeing Co. 737 jets, according to the company. Kuban,
Deripaska’s regional airline, flew 548,000 passengers last year
on 12 Yakovlev Yak-42 mid-range jets, according to the company’s
website. Kuban added three Boeing 737s to its fleet this year.  
 Sergei Babichenko , a spokesman for Deripaska’s Basic
Element holding company, and Sky Express Chief Executive Officer
 Vitaly Korenyugin  declined to comment.
