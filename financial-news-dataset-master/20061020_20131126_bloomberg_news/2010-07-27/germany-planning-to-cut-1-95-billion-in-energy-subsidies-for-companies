             German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government plans to raise costs for  manufacturers  by cutting
subsidies for energy use, a measure that may reap 1.5 billion
euros ($1.95 billion) per year for federal coffers.  
 Companies seeking relief on their electricity bill will
have to pay the first 5,000 euros of the energy tax per year
themselves, compared with 512 euros under current rules, a
government discussion paper e-mailed today showed.  
 A reduction on the tax of as much as 95 percent at present,
which benefits mainly energy-intensive companies such as cement-
makers, will be lowered to 80 percent in 2011 and 60 percent in
2012, the paper shows. The government aims to bring the law into
effect next year.  
 The measures, which are part of a four-year package of
spending cuts and revenue-raising measures worth 81.6 billion
euros, “threaten the existence” of energy-intensive industries
employing 870,000 people in Germany, the BDI industry lobby  said 
in a statement on July 11.  
 European countries are slashing budget deficits to thwart a
sovereign-debt crisis spreading from Greece that weakened the
euro, raised borrowing costs for the most indebted nations and
prompted European Union governments to craft a 750 billion-euro
aid package in May.  
 The German cuts will reduce the federal budget deficit by
about 40 percent over the next five years, Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said July 7. The government plans to cut the
total budget deficit to the European Union limit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012 from about 4.5 percent this year.
