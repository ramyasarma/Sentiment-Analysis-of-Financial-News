             Corn prices will average about 9
percent more in the first three months of 2011 than they have
since July 1 because smaller crops in Europe, Russia and Ukraine
will boost demand for U.S. exports to Asia, according to
Rabobank Group.  
 The price will average $4.25 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade in the three months ending March 31, said  Luke Chandler , Rabobank’s executive director of agricultural market
research. The price averaged about $3.91 this month at the close
of trading yesterday.  
 “We have turned bullish on prices” because of the drop in
world grain production, Chandler said yesterday during an
interview in Chicago. “We could see additional feed-grain
demand moving back to U.S. corn” to avoid the risk of
additional output losses in Europe and the Black Sea region,
Chandler said.  
 Demand will increase just as yields drop in the U.S., where
crops got too much rain this year, Chandler said. The U.S. is
the world’s largest grower and exporter.  
 The average yield in U.S. may fall to 162 bushels an acre,
less than the 163.5 bushels forecast earlier this month by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and a record yield of 164.7
bushels last year, he said.  
 “Yield estimates will become increasingly important to
determine the amount of corn that can be used to meet demand,”
Chandler said. “The U.S. supply already looks tight” with the
USDA using an above-average yield forecast, he said.  
 Corn also may rise because U.S. supplies are cheaper for
importers in China, Chandler said. Corn futures on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange  have risen 4.1 percent this year compared
with an 8.9 percent drop in Chicago futures. Dalian corn is
trading at a $3.46 premium to Chicago futures. China’s expanding
economy is boosting demand for meat, milk and eggs, as rising
incomes allow people to buy more food.  
 “China prices are relatively high compared to the U.S.,”
Chandler said. “Exports are on the increase.”
