             U.K. government bonds fell, leaving
the 10-year yield at the highest in almost a month amid optimism
that the global recovery is picking up, boosting stocks and
reducing demand for the safety of fixed income.  
 Two-year notes, perceived to be the safest securities, had
their longest streak of losses since April 23. The FTSE 100
Index advanced for a second day, following counterparts across
Europe higher. The pound climbed to its strongest level in five
months against the dollar as an industry report showed  retail
sales  rose at the fastest pace in more than three years in July.
The U.K. is selling index-linked bonds due 2040 through banks
today.  
 “Overall, the gilts market will be focused on what
equities do,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “There isn’t a great deal
of appetite.”  
 The yield on the 10-year gilt increased four basis points
to 3.49 percent as of 12:54 p.m. in London, the most since June
22. The 4.75 percent security maturing March 2020 lost 0.33, or
3.3 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,546) face amount, to 110.23. The
two-year yield increased four basis points to 0.93 percent. The
yield was at 0.72 on July 1.  
 The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.5546, after advancing to
$1.5548, the strongest level since Feb. 23. It was little
changed at 83.9 pence per euro.  
 Economic Data  
 Economic data in the U.K. and around the world is helping
lift bond yields. A report today showed German consumer
confidence will rise in August as economic growth accelerates.  
 U.K. retailers saying sales volumes rose from a year
earlier outnumbered those reporting declines by 33 percentage
points, the London-based  Confederation  of British Industry said
in a report today. The median estimate of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 3 percentage points.  
 “There is some buoyancy in sterling and the CBI figures
may have helped with that,”  Lauren Rosborough , a senior
currency analyst at Westpac Banking Corp. in London, said in an
e-mail.  
 The 10-year yield has increased 13 basis points since July
22, a day before data showed the economy grew more than twice 
as much as economists estimated in the second quarter. The  
economy will probably expand by 1.2 percent this year, after a  
4.9 percent decline in 2009, according to a Bloomberg survey.  
 Gilts returned 5.01 percent this year, compared with a gain
of 5.94 for German bonds, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Treasuries handed investors 6.09 percent.  
 Banks Rise  
 The FTSE 350 Banks Index gained by the most since May 10,
rising by as much as 4.3 percent. The MSCI World Index headed
for a fourth day of gains.  UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
reported a third consecutive quarterly profit, beating analysts’
estimates, while Germany’s Deutsche Bank AG also posted earnings
that exceeded analysts’ predictions.  
 The U.K.’s sale of 0.625 percent 2040 index-linked bonds
will raise 6 billion pounds, according to bankers involved in
the transaction. Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC
Holdings Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are managing
the issue. The notes will be priced to yield the same as the
1.125 percent linker note due 2037.
