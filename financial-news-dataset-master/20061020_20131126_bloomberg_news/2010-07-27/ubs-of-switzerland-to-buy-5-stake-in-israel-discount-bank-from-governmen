             UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
will buy a 5 percent stake of  Israel Discount Bank Ltd.  from the
Israeli government for an undisclosed price.  
 UBS was one of four foreign financial institutions that
made a bid for Israel’s third-largest lender, the Finance
Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. Further details
will be released after the sale is completed, it said.  
 The sale of the Discount Bank stake was the second by the
government this year, after Deutsche Bank AG in January bought 5
percent. The German bank that month said it planned to resell
the shares to institutional investors. The government still
holds 15 percent of Discount Bank. Israel is also planning to
sell its remaining 11.46 percent stake in Bank Leumi Le-Israel
Ltd., the country’s largest lender.  
 UBS will have the right to exercise an overallotment option
for another 3.33 percent within 24 hours, and the government
will not sell more shares in the bank for a three-month period,
the ministry said yesterday prior to the sale.  
 Discount fell for a second day, declining 1.2 percent to
6.846 shekels at 12:07 p.m. in Tel Aviv.
