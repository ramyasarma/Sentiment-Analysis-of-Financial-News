             The Australian dollar is in a
“rising trend” and may extend gains toward an eight-month high
of 94 U.S. cents, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said, citing
trading patterns.  
 The currency broke through a “psychological barrier”
yesterday when it climbed above 90 U.S. cents following an
earlier advance past resistance at 88.50 cents, said  Greg Gibbs ,
a foreign-exchange strategist at RBS in Sydney. The so-called
Aussie is now poised to rise to an initial target of 91.25 cents,
before challenging this year’s high of 93.89 cents, he said.  
 “The 88.50-cent level capped the Aussie several times
before it broke higher and 90 is a psychological barrier,”
Gibbs said. “The Aussie is now clearly in a rising trend.”  
 Australia’s currency traded at 90.20 cents as of 1:22 p.m.
in Sydney after reaching 90.36 yesterday, the first time it had
climbed above 90 cents since May 13. The last time the currency
traded above 94 cents was in November 2009.  
 Investors should buy the currency on “dips” toward 90
cents and also if it approaches the 200-day moving average that
is currently at 89.64 cents, Gibbs said.  
 Resistance refers to areas on a chart where orders to sell
a currency may be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast price changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
