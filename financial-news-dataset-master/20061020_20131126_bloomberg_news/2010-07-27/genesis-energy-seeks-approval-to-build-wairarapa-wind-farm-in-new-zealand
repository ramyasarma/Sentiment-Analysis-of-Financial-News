             Genesis Energy Ltd., a New Zealand
goverment-owned electricity generator, is seeking approvals to
build a wind farm in the Wairarapa at the southern end of the
nation’s North Island.  
 The Castle Hill site has potential generating capacity of
600 megawatts, the Auckland-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. The exact number of turbines, their size and location
are yet to be determined, it said.
