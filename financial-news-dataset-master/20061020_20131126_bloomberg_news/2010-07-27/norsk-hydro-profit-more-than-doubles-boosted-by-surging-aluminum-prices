             Norsk Hydro ASA , Europe’s third-
largest aluminum maker, said second-quarter profit more than
doubled after prices for the metal surged 50 percent.  
 Net income jumped to 503 million kroner ($82 million) from
211 million kroner a year earlier, Hydro said in a statement
today. Sales rose 12 percent 19.8 billion kroner.  
 “We will raise our estimates on the back of this report,”
 Samir Bendriss , head of research at Pareto Securities ASA in
Oslo, wrote in a note today. “The stock should move up.”  
 The company rose 1 percent to 35.30 kroner by 10:18 a.m. in
Oslo trading. Realized aluminum prices in the quarter averaged
$2,200 a metric ton, up from $1,468 a year earlier, it said.  
 Hydro  is seeking to boost profit margins by cutting power
costs after slashing output 26 percent last year on increased
electricity charges and weakening demand. The company will spend
260 million kroner building an aluminum recycling plant that
uses 5 percent of the energy needed for a regular smelter.
Rising global output will exceed demand this year, it said.  
 The aluminum maker hedged most of its production until the
end of 2011 at a price of $2,400 a ton, the company said.  
 Hydro has sold forward “substantially all of its primary”
aluminum production for the third quarter at about $2,175 per
ton, excluding production from Qatalum, its joint venture unit
in Qatar, it said. Qatalum reached 48 percent of its full
production capacity at the end of June, the company said.  
 Hydro forecasts earnings from alumina and raw materials
businesses to fall in the second half on lower prices.  
 The second quarter profit missed the 602.1 million-krone
average of seven analyst estimates Bloomberg compiled.
