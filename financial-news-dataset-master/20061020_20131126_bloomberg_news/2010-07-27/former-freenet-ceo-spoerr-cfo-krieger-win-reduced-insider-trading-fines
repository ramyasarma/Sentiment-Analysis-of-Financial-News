             Former  Freenet AG  Chief Executive
Officer  Eckhard Spoerr  and Chief Financial Officer  Axel Krieger 
won reductions in fines and asset seizures against them for
criminal insider trading.  
 After rehearing the case, the Hamburg Regional Court today
sentenced Spoerr to pay a fine of 75,000 euros ($97,500) and
ordered him to give up 327,000 euros in profits made in the
transactions. Krieger was fined 120,000 euros and the judges
seized 324,000 euros in profits he made, court spokesman Janko
Buesser said in an e-mailed statement.  
 When they were originally convicted on the charges of using
insider information to sell shares in the German Internet and
mobile-phone company last year, Spoerr was fined 300,000 euros
and Krieger received a 150,000-euro fine. Both men have denied
wrongdoing. While the Federal Court of Justice earlier this year
upheld the conviction on appeal, it ordered the Hamburg court to
re-sentence the men.  
 “The chamber seized the complete advantage the two
defendants got from the illicit transactions,” said Buesser.
“They didn’t have losses which other shareholders had.”  
 Marc Langrock and Otmar Kury, the men’s lawyers, said they
would appeal today’s sentence as well.  
 “Today’s verdict, even though it reduced the sanctions by
more that 50 percent, doesn’t comply with the requirements the
Federal Court of Justice forcefully ordered,” the lawyers said
in an e-mailed statement.  
 Wrongful Seizure  
 The trial judges wrongfully seized about 700,000 euros from
each man, the equivalent of the sale price of the shares, the
appeals court had ruled. It ordered the trial judges to
recalculate the amount and to seize only that part of the sales
price increased by selling early using inside knowledge.  
 Spoerr and Krieger each sold about 62,000 shares in several
transactions for 1.2 million euros in July 2004, while knowing
about the drop in sales in the second quarter that year,
according to the trial court’s findings. The stock slumped 25
percent on Aug. 9, 2004, when Freenet reported its results.  
 Both men have said they had already decided in 2003 to sell
the shares they were to receive under a stock option program as
soon as they became available. The earliest possible date to
sell those shares was July 2004.  
 Spoerr left Freenet in January 2009, shortly after the
opening of the original trial. Krieger plans to leave the
company by the end of the year, Freenet announced July 15.
