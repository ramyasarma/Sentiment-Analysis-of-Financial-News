             China Investment Corp. , the nation’s
sovereign wealth fund, is starting a new round of international
hiring to meet its “business development needs,” according to
a  statement  today on its website.  
 The company is offering 64 positions from asset allocation
to private equity investment, with jobs posted on its  website .  
 The $300 billion fund will seek a “more flexible”
investment strategy this year as global markets didn’t show a
clear trend, Executive Vice President  Jesse Wang  told reporters
in Beijing in March. The company earlier this month sold 5.1
million shares in Morgan Stanley after the stock rallied.  
 CIC is likely to report a return on its global portfolio
“well above 10 percent” for 2009, according to  Rachel Ziemba ,
London-based senior analyst at Roubini Global Economics, after
it accelerated investments in commodity-related companies.  
 CIC in June, 2009, provided vacancies for 33 categories in
13 departments. The company had about 200 employees, according
to its 2008 annual report released Aug. 7 last year.
