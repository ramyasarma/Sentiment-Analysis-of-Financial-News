             The New York Jets have approached
free agent  Terrell Owens ’s agent and discussed signing the five-
time All-Pro receiver, ESPN  reported  on its website.  
 Signing Owens, 36, is considered a long shot for the Jets,
with one league source that ESPN spoke with estimating the
chances at 20 percent.  
 Cincinnati Bengals President  Mike Brown  publicly stated the
team’s interest in signing Owens. The Bengals have offered Owens
an incentive-laden contract and given him until tomorrow to make
a decision, ESPN said.  
 Owens, a six-time Pro Bowl selection who’s also been a
polarizing figure in National Football League locker rooms,
caught 55 passes for 829 yards and five touchdowns last season
with the Buffalo Bills. He’s also played for the San Francisco
49ers, Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys during his 14-year
NFL career.  
 Owens is third all-time in NFL career receiving yards with
14,951, and third in receiving touchdowns with 144.
