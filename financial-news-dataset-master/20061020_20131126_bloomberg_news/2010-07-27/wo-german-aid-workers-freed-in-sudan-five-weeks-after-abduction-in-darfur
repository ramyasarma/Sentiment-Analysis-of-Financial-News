             Two German aid workers kidnapped
last month by gunmen in Sudan’s western region of Darfur were
freed today, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said.  
 Both men are now in the hands of the Sudanese authorities
and will be transferred later today to the capital, Khartoum,
Westerwelle said in an e-mailed statement.  
 The aid workers, employed by German non-governmental
organization Technisches Hilfswerk, were abducted on June 22
along with their Sudanese security guard by gunmen wearing in
civilan clothes. The guard was released soon after the
kidnapping.  
 The German embassy has been in contact with the men, both
of whom are well, “given the difficult time they’ve been
through,” Westerwelle said.
