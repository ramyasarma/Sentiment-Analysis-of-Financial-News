             Billionaire  Richard Branson  said
he’s considering selling a stake in fitness chain Virgin Active
to private equity firms or offering shares to the public.  
 “Discussions are going on,” Branson, chairman of Virgin
Group Ltd., told reporters in Sydney today after introducing
financial-services products in Australia. “It’s not decided
yet. It depends on the markets.”  
 A decision may be made in the next few months, Branson
said. Virgin Active has been approached by buyout firms as it
seeks to raise money for acquisitions, a person with knowledge
of the talks said this week.  
 The London Stock Exchage’s  FTSE 100 Index  has fallen for
three straight months.  
 Virgin Active has 170 health and fitness clubs in the U.K.,
Italy, Spain and South Africa and more than 900,000 members,
according to its website.
