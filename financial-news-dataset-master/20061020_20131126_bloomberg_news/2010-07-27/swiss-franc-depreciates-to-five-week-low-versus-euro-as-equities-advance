             The Swiss franc declined to a five-
week low against the euro and dropped versus the dollar as gains
by stocks and an increase in German consumer confidence curbed
demand for the currency as a refuge.  
 The franc weakened for a fourth consecutive day as the
 Swiss Market Index  of equities jumped 1.2 percent, led by UBS AG
after the nation’s biggest bank posted profit that surpassed
analysts’ estimates. A GfK AG index showed German consumer
sentiment will climb to 3.9 in August, from a revised 3.6 this
month, beating economist predictions.  
 “Swiss stock markets opened with a clear increase today,”
said  Ursina Kubli , a foreign-exchange analyst at Bank Sarasin &
Cie in Zurich. “That means that risk aversion has decreased,
which normally pushes down the Swiss franc.”  
 The franc depreciated as much as 1.3 percent to 1.3796 per
euro, the weakest level since June 21, and was at 1.3792 against
the euro as of 6:37 p.m. in Zurich. It slid against all of its
16 most-traded counterparts, dropping 1.2 percent to 1.06124
versus the dollar.
