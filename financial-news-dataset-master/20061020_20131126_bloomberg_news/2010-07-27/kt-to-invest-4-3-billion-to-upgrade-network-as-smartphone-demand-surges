             KT Corp. , South Korea’s largest
phone and Internet company, plans to invest 5.1 trillion won
($4.3 billion) over five years upgrading its network to meet
demand for wireless data from smartphone users.  
 The nation’s sole provider of  Apple Inc. ’s iPhone will
spend 4.07 trillion won on its mobile-phone network from 2010 to
2014 and about 800 billion won on Wi-Fi and wireless broadband,
Seongnam, South Korea-based KT said in an e-mail today. The rest
of the investments will go toward cloud services and for so-
called backbone equipment, it said.  
 KT said the investments will allow the company to meet
“explosive” growth in demand for Internet access. As products
such as the iPhone drive up demand for wireless data downloads,
the company expects its number of smartphone subscribers to more
than double to 6 million next year and tablet-computer customers
to jump fivefold to 1 million.  
 KT fell 0.4 percent to 41,950 won at 10:29 a.m. in Seoul
trading, compared with the 0.3 percent gain by the nation’s
benchmark Kospi stock index.
