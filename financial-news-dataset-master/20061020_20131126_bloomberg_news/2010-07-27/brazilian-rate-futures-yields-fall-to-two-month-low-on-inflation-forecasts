             Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell to a two-month low as a drop in
economists’ year-end inflation forecasts boosted speculation the
central bank will slow the pace of interest-rate increases.  
 The yield on the  contract  due in January, the most traded
in Sao Paulo, declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 10.84 percent, the lowest level since May 25.  
 “Inflation expectations from the weekly survey are still
trending down,” said  Ram Bala Chandran , a Latin America
currency and rates analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New York.
“People were expecting this week’s inflation expectations to go
higher, but they didn’t.”  
 The inflation rate will end the year at 5.35 percent,
compared with a week-earlier forecast of 5.42 percent, according
to the median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100
economists published yesterday. The central bank’s eight-member
board, led by  Henrique Meirelles , will raise the Selic to 11.75
percent by year-end, compared with a week-earlier forecast of 12
percent, the survey shows.  
 The real gained 0.2 percent to 1.7591 per dollar, from
1.7624 yesterday.
