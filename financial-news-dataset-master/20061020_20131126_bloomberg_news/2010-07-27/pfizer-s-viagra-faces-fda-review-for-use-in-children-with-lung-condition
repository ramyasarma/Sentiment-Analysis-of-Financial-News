             A form of  Pfizer Inc. ’s erection
drug Viagra, sold as the blood-pressure treatment called Revatio
in adults, may be used for children with a rare lung disorder if
U.S. regulators can agree on how to test it.  
 The condition, called pulmonary arterial hypertension,
affects only 600 children a year, New York-based Pfizer said. It
causes high blood pressure in arteries in the lungs, making the
right side of the heart work harder than normal and causing
chest pain, dizziness and fatigue. Outside advisers to the Food
and Drug Administration are set to  meet  July 29 to evaluate
whether Pfizer’s study of Revatio is sufficient to determine its
effectiveness in children, the agency said today.  
 The FDA in 2001 asked Pfizer, the world’s biggest
drugmaker, to study the medicine in children with the lung
disorder. If the New York-based company meets the FDA study
requirements, the drug would get an extra six months on the
market without generic competition. Patents on the drug, with
2009 sales of $1.89 billion as Viagra and $450 million as
Revatio, are expected to expire in 2012. Some doctors are
already using the treatment in kids with the lung condition.  
 “It’s a good option in pediatric patients because it is
well-tolerated, in that it doesn’t have as many side effects as
some of the other options,” said Chad Knoderer, a pediatric
clinical pharmacist at Riley Hospital for Children in
Indianapolis, who has used Viagra in kids with the disorder.  
 FDA Request  
 Sildenafil, the chemical name for both Viagra and Revatio,
blocks an enzyme found in the lungs and penis that regulates
blood flow. Pfizer is considering whether to seek approval for
Revatio, a lower-dose form of sildenafil, in children, said
Colin Ewen, an executive director at the company, in a July 23
telephone interview.  
 Pfizer  shares  rose 25 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $15.27 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 The FDA is asking its panel of advisers to decide what is
the best measurement to use in determining if the drug is
effective in children with pulmonary hypertension.  
 In adults, researchers typically use an exercise test to
determine if the drug is having a benefit. Because that test was
difficult to perform in young children, Pfizer has asked the FDA
to consider an alternative test that measures blood flow by
inserting a catheter through the arteries.  
 In Pfizer’s study of 234 children, the drug failed to show
a benefit when the children’s exercise ability was measured.
However, it did show a significant benefit when researchers used
an alternative measure of blood flow.
