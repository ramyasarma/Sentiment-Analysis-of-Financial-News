             Oil Search Ltd. , a partner in Exxon
Mobil Corp.’s $15 billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua
New Guinea, is studying growth opportunities and plans to
announce results of a “strategic review” at the end of 2010.  
 Oil Search started during the second quarter examining
options for expansion, adding reserves and using the cash that
will be generated by the LNG development, the Port Moresby-based
company said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  
 “This review is designed to refine the vision for Oil
Search over the next year years,” Papua New Guinea’s largest
oil and gas producer said today. The company will give updates
on the review at the end of 2010 and in early 2011.  
 Oil Search wants to find reserves to support two more
processing units at the  Exxon Mobil -operated LNG venture, it
said in April. The companies initially plan to build two
units able to produce 6.6 million metric tons of LNG a year.  
 The gas Oil Search needs may come from the LNG
project’s existing fields or from exploration, it said today.
The company said it’s confident of finding customers for the
additional LNG.  
 Oil Search  advanced 1.2 percent to A$5.91 at 10:25 a.m. in
Sydney trading, compared with a 0.7 percent increase for the
benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index .  
 Second-quarter output gained 2 percent from a year earlier
to 1.94 million barrels of oil equivalent, the company said.
Operating revenue climbed 22 percent to $142.7 million on higher
oil prices. UBS AG expected revenue of $141.6 million.  
 The average price Oil Search received for its oil rose 42
percent to $78.81 a barrel in the three months ended June 30
from $55.57. Oil Search kept its 2010 production forecast
unchanged at 7.2 million to 7.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent.
