             Walt Disney Co.  agreed to buy
Playdom Inc. for $563.2 million, acquiring the second-biggest
maker of games played on Facebook and MySpace websites.  
 Playdom’s owners may receive an additional $200 million if
performance goals are met, Burbank, California-based Disney, the
world’s largest media company, said today in a statement.  
 The purchase extends Disney’s drive into online and mobile
games. This month, the company  bought  Tapulous Inc., a developer
of music-related games for Apple Inc.’s iPod and iPad. Playdom
has the talent Disney needs to expand in social media, Chief
Executive Officer  Bob Iger  said in an interview.  
 “I want to be bold and aggressive,” Iger said. “You
don’t get the kind of growth that we want by building from the
inside.”  
 Disney plans to make more acquisitions, Iger said, without
being specific.  
 “We don’t intend to stand still as we migrate this
company’s great wealth of content to new technology,” he said.  
 Playdom, based in Mountain View, California, raised $33
million in June from venture capital groups including Disney-
backed Steamboat Ventures, which invests in digital media,
consumer and technology companies. The funding brought the total
raised by the closely held company to $76 million.  
 Playdom announced a content partnership with Disney’s ESPN
sports cable channel in May.  
 Disney fell 12 cents to $34.28 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 6.3
percent this year.
