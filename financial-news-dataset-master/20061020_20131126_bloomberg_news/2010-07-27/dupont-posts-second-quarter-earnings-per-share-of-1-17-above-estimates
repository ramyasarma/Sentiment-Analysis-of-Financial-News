             DuPont Co. , the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, reported second-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast
amid improving global demand.  
 Second-quarter profit excluding some items was $1.17 a
share, topping the 94-cent  average estimate  of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Earnings excluding some items will be
$2.90 to $3.05 a share in 2010, exceeding a previous  prediction 
of $2.50 to $2.70 and the $2.64 average estimate of 14 analysts
in the Bloomberg survey.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Ellen Kullman  cut costs last year
and is boosting output as demand rises around the world and
across the company’s businesses, including auto paints and
plastics, crop seeds and materials used to harness solar power.
Sales advanced 26 percent to $8.62 billion, driven by a 21
percent increase in sales volumes.  
 “It’s a solid quarter and they are underscoring they
expect volumes are going to remain fairly strong,” said
Jefferies & Co. analyst  Laurence Alexander , whose per-share
estimate of $1.01 was highest among 10 analysts surveyed. “We
had expected a beat driven by electronics and auto refinish, and
the upside surprise reflects a broad-based recovery in their end
markets.”  
 DuPont rose $1.37, or 3.5 percent, to $40.36 at 10:05 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The shares  gained
16 percent this year through yesterday.  
 Asia-Pacific  
 The Asia-Pacific region led year-over-year sales gains with
a 47 percent increase, followed by Canada with a 30 percent
rise. The region that includes Europe grew 24 percent, and U.S.
revenue rose 18 percent.  
 The higher profit forecast includes $460 million to $480
million in earnings from hypertension medicines Cozaar and
Hyzaar, compared with a prior forecast of $360 million to $400
million. The drugs, marketed through  Merck & Co. , lost patent
protection in the U.S. and Europe earlier this year. They
contributed $70 million to second-quarter profit.  
 Second-quarter  net income  more than doubled to $1.16
billion, or $1.26 a share, from $417 million, or 46 cents, a
year earlier.  
 Rising car production helped earnings to more than double
in the coatings unit, the world’s biggest maker of auto paint,
and contributed to a sevenfold profit increase in performance
materials, which makes plastics for vehicle parts and packaging.
U.S. automakers raised output by 70 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, according to Federal Reserve  data .  
 Electronics Sales  
 Profit in the electronics and communications unit surged
fivefold as sales jumped 53 percent, led by production of
photovoltaic materials and growth in the Asia-Pacific region,
DuPont said.  
 Profit in the agriculture unit, the largest business, rose
31 percent to $762 million driven by higher seed sales. DuPont
gained 2 percentage points of market share in North American
corn seed and 4 points in domestic soybean seed, Chief Financial
Officer  Nicholas Fanandakis  said today on a conference call.  
 Kullman in November unveiled a plan to increase earnings 20
percent a year through 2012. She said sales gains of at least 10
percent will more than make up for the loss of $1 billion in
royalties from Cozaar and Hyzaar.  
 DuPont,  founded  in 1802 to make gunpowder, produces
thousands of products from Corian countertops and Teflon
coatings to Tyvek weather barrier and Kevlar bullet-proof
fibers.  
 Dow Chemical Co.  and Exxon Mobil Corp. are the two largest
U.S. chemical makers by sales.
