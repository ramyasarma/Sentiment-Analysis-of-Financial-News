             Saad Group, the business owned by
Saudi billionaire  Maan al-Sanea , was ordered by a U.K. judge to
pay $33.1 million to  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC  for
defaulting on a foreign-currency swap agreement.  
 Saad Trading Contracting and Financial Services Co.’s
defenses that Abu Dhabi didn’t terminate the swap agreement on
time or specify a bank account for payment were “hopeless,”
Judge Michael Brindle ruled today in the High Court in London.  
 Saad defaulted when its credit rating was withdrawn in June
2009, Brindle said. The company, based in al-Khobar, Saudi
Arabia, argued the default applied to other deals between the
companies and not to the 2008 swap created for Saad to hedge
against future currency fluctuations.  
 Saudi banks tightened lending after Saad and another Saudi
company, Ahmad Hamad Al-Gosaibi & Brothers Co., defaulted on
loans last year, triggering court battles around the globe. In
one of the cases, Al-Gosaibi, the family into which al-Sanea
married, accused him in New York of siphoning off $10 billion
while he was running a money-management business for them, court
filings show.  
 Saad Group’s press office in London didn’t immediately
return a call for comment.
