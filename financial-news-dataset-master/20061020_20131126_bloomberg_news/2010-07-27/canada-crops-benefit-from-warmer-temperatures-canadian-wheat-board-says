             Crops in western Canada benefitted
from warm temperatures and scattered rains last week, according
to the Canadian Wheat Board.  
 Crop development in Saskatchewan and Alberta still is seven
to 14 days behind normal, the Wheat Board said today in a report
on its website. “The absence of heat stress, moisture reserves,
and warmer temperatures has created some ideal growing
conditions for those crops that were able to be seeded
earlier,” the board said.
