             Most Japanese  stocks  rose, led by
banks, after the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision eased
some rule proposals, mitigating concerns that banks will have to
raise more capital.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest bank
by market value, increased 2.5 percent. Seiko Epson Corp.
climbed 4.4 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the printer
maker may have posted an operating profit.  Toyota  Motor Corp.,
the largest carmaker worldwide, dropped 1.6 percent on a
stronger yen. JFE Holdings Inc. declined 3.1 percent after
Japan’s second-largest steelmaker forecast full-year profit that
was lower than analysts’ estimates.  
 The  Topix  index gained less than 0.1 percent to 846.12 with
about four stocks rising for every three that declined at the 3
p.m. market close in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid
0.1 percent to 9,496.85 after advancing as much as 0.4 percent.  
 “The Basel Committee’s easing of restrictions gives
investors a reason to take another look at Japanese banks, which
have been cheap recently,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees
about $450 million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “It eases concerns about capital raising.”  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slipped 0.2
percent in New York today. The S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to
1,115.01 yesterday after FedEx Corp., the second-largest U.S.
package-shipping company, boosted its profit forecast and a
report showing improved new-home sales eased concern the
economic recovery will stall.  
 Topix Valuations  
 The Topix has lost 6.8 percent in 2010, compared with a
drop of less than 0.1 percent by the  S&P 500  and a 1.3 percent
gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are valued at 16.4 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.5 times for the S&P and 11.9 times for the Stoxx.  
 Banks  advanced the most on the Topix after the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision agreed yesterday to allow
certain assets, including minority stakes in other financial
companies, to count as capital, according to a statement. The
committee set a leverage ratio to apply to banks globally for
the first time, which could become binding by 2018, pending
further adjustments to the method of calculating banks’ assets.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ increased 2.5 percent to 419 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui financial Group Inc. , Japan’s No. 2 publicly traded bank,
advanced 2.8 percent to 2,587 yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,
Japan’s third-biggest bank, rose 2.2 percent to 139 yen.  
 Relaxed Regulations  
 “Changes in the restrictions by the Basel Committee will
boost the common equity capital ratio by about 1 percent at
Japanese mega banks,” according to  Shinichi Ina , a Tokyo-based
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Relaxation of the
regulations will remove remaining concerns about equity capital
increases.”  
 Ina maintained his ratings on the banks at “outperform.”  
 Seiko Epson  leapt 4.4 percent to 1,156 yen. The company may
have earned 2 billion yen ($23 million) in operating profit in
the first quarter after expecting a loss, the Nikkei newspaper
reported.  
 “Corporate earnings are good, so companies which reported
strong earnings should be targets of buying,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  
 Investors’ concerns that U.S. economic growth will slow
helped boost companies that rely on domestic sales.  Osaka Gas
Co. , Japan’s second-biggest natural gas provider, gained 1.3
percent to 323 yen. Seven & I Holdings Co., Japan’s largest
operator of convenience stores, advanced 1.2 percent to 2,068
yen. Tokyu Corp., a railway operator, rose 1.9 percent to 382
yen. At least 70 percent of these companies’ revenue derives
from domestic sales.  
 U.S. Home Sales  
 Sales of U.S. new homes increased 24 percent in June from
May to an annual pace of 330,000, the second-lowest in data
going back to 1963 after May’s downwardly revised 267,000 pace,
according to the Commerce Department.  
 “The level of new home sales was still low, so we cannot
completely be optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook,” said
 Naoteru Teraoka , general manager at the investment unit of
Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $22 billion.  
 Exporters weighed on the market after the yen strengthened.
Toyota slid 1.6 percent to 3,040 yen and was the heaviest drag
on the Topix. Nintendo Co., the world’s biggest maker of
portable video-game players, sank 1.2 percent to 24,330 yen.
Fanuc Ltd., an industrial-robot maker that earns 80 percent of
its revenue outside Japan, lost 0.9 percent to 10,400 yen.  
 Earnings Concerns  
 The yen appreciated to as much as 86.83 against the dollar,
compared with 87.47 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency strengthened to
112.79 from 112.94. The stronger yen reduces income when
overseas revenue is converted into local currency.  
 “Strong earnings are positive for the market, but
sentiment may worsen if the yen’s appreciation causes companies
to make conservative earnings forecasts,” Chuo Mitsui’s Teraoka
said.  
 Nomura Securities Co. cut forecasts for the dollar against
the yen, citing a slowing U.S. economy and expectations the
Federal Reserve won’t raise interest rates until the first half
of 2011. It expects the dollar to trade at 90 yen by the third
quarter of this year from 95 yen previously, it said in a
research note dated yesterday. The dollar will finish 2010 at
87.5 yen from an earlier estimate of 97 yen, the note said.  
 JFE Holdings  slumped 3.1 percent to 2,656 yen, the largest
decline in the Nikkei. The steelmaker forecast 120 billion yen
($1.38 billion) in full-year net income, lower than the median
estimate of 178.4 billion yen by 21 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.
