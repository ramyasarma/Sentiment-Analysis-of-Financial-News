             Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the
world’s largest luxury-car maker, is recalling as many as
12,400 new 5-Series sedans in the U.S. and China to fix their
fuel-level sensors.  
 The carmaker is recalling 6,400 cars in the U.S. and 5,000
to 6,000 vehicles in China, spokesman Frank Strebe said by
telephone today. Replacing a part of the tank sensor will take
about half a day, he said.  
 A flaw means that the fuel sensor can become wedged against
the tank, according to the U.S.  National Highway Traffic and
Safety Administration . The fuel gauge in the instrument cluster
would then display a higher amount of fuel than was present,
increasing the likelihood of stalling as drivers inadvertently
run out of gas, the agency said.  
 The new 5-Series, which abandoned the flared headlights and
small kidney-shaped grill of the previous version, starts at
$44,550 in the U.S. The model went on sale in Europe in late
March and in the U.S. in June. Sales Chief  Ian Robertson  said in
a June 23 interview that the model had sold out, forcing clients
to wait as long as four months for deliveries.  
 Demand for the revamped 5-Series, which competes with
Mercedes’s E-Class and Toyota Motor Corp.’s Lexus GS, prompted
Munich-based BMW on July 13 to raise its 2010 sales and earnings
forecast.  
 BMW’s Strebe said that there had been 10 reported incidents
in the U.S. as a consequence of the fault. The affected vehicles
were manufactured from Jan. 12 through July 1, 2010, according
to the NHTSA.  
 BMW  fell  1.5 percent to 41.50 euros at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Frankfurt, giving the carmaker a market value of 26.5 billion
euros ($34.4 billion).
