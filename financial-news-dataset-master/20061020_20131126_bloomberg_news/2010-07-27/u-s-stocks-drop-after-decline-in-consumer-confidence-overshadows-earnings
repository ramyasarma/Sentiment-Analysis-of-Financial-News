             U.S. stocks retreated, wiping out
gains from higher-than-estimated profit at DuPont Co. and
Lexmark International Inc., after a gauge of consumer confidence
fell to the lowest level in five months.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,112.19 at 11:07 a.m. New York time after rising as much as 0.5
percent and erasing its decline since Dec. 31.  
 The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to
50.4 from a revised 54.3 in June, figures from the private
research group showed today. The gauge was forecast to drop to
51, according the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
