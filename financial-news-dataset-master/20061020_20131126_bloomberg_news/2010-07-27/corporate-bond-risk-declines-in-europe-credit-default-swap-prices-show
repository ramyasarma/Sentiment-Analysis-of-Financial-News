             The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds fell for a sixth day, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 7.5
basis points to 469.5, the lowest level since May 13, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 8 a.m. in London. The index is
a benchmark for the cost of protecting bonds against default and
a decline signals improvement in perceptions of credit quality.  
 The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 2.25 basis points to 102.5,
JPMorgan prices show. The cost of protecting bank bonds from
default also fell, with the Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked
to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers down 6.5 at 111, the
lowest since April 21, and the subordinated index 12 lower at
174.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.
