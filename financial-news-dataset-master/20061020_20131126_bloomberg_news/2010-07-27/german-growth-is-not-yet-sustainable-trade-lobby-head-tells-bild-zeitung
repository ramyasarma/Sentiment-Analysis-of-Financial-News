             Germany’s export-driven economic
expansion will slow in 2011 as foreign sales cool and government
support programs expire,  Anton Boerner , head of the BGA
wholesale and export federation,  told  Bild newspaper.  
 The German economy isn’t yet in a self-sustaining economic
upswing, Boerner said. Germany’s “debt crisis” poses a risk to
growth and governments merely “bought time” by saving Greece
from default, he said.  
 While a lower euro exchange rate helps exports, it also
makes raw materials more expensive that are increasingly harder
to come by, Boerner said. The government should use any increase
in tax revenue from the current upswing to boost private
investment in the economy, such as construction, he said.
