             U.S. Steel Corp. , the country’s
largest producer of the metal, tumbled the most since June after
reporting an unexpected second-quarter loss following the
revaluation of a loan.  
 U.S. Steel  fell  $3.13, or 6.4 percent, to $45.76 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
decline since June 4.  The shares  have declined 17 percent this
year.  
 The Pittsburgh-based company reported a net loss that
included a $96 million foreign-currency loss from the
revaluation of a $1.4 billion loan made to a European
subsidiary. Excluding one-time items, profit was 44 cents a
share, missing the 66-cent  average estimate  of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 “They’ve underperformed pretty badly,”  Charles Bradford ,
a partner at New York-based consultants Affiliated Research
Group LLC, said in a telephone interview. “They have their own
iron ore, so they should have substantially outperformed.”  
 U.S. Steel’s second-quarter  net loss  narrowed to $25
million, or 17 cents a share, from $392 million, or $2.92, a
year earlier, the company said today. Sales more than doubled to
$4.68 billion.  
 Operating profit was $198 million, compared with a $465
million operating loss a year earlier, the company said. Third-
quarter operating income will be less than in the second quarter
as shipments and production of flat-rolled steel decline, U.S.
Steel said.  
 Outlook ‘Weak’  
 “Outlook was weak with a forecast breakeven result in the
domestic steel division,”  Michelle Applebaum , who runs a
Chicago-based equity research company, said in a note.  
 U.S. Steel, with its own supply of iron ore, should have an
advantage over companies such as  AK Steel Holding Corp. , which
purchase the raw material from suppliers, Bradford said.  
 AK Steel said today second-quarter net income was $26.7
million, or 24 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $47.2
million, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding some one-
time items was 34 cents a share, beating the 7-cent  average
estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 AK Steel  fell  71 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $14.49 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest
decline since June 29.  
 AK Steel’s shares may have fallen because of lower-than-
expected consumer confidence results reported today, which may
indicate consumers will not make purchases from auto companies,
a key AK Steel customer,  John Stephenson , who helps manage
C$1.65 billion ($1.59 billion) at First Asset Investment
Management in Toronto, said in an interview.  
 “The guidance wasn’t terrific, but it wasn’t terrible
either,” Stephenson said. “This one is getting thrown in with
the kitchen sink.”
