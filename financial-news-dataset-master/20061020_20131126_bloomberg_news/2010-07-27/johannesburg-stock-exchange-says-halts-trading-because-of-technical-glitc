             JSE Ltd. , the Johannesburg-based
operator of Africa’s largest stock exchange, said it halted
trading in South African shares because of a technical problem.  
 The bourse is investigating the cause of the technical
glitch with trading in cash equities, spokeswoman Victoria
Williams said in a telephone interview today. The exchange is
unable to say when trading will resume, she said.  
 The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  last gained 53.55, or
0.2 percent, to 28,552.55 by 9:26 a.m., when trading stopped in
Johannesburg. Technical problems led to a 1 1/2-hour delay in
the opening of trade on July 12 and a postponement for 50
minutes on Nov. 30.  
 “This looks like quite a serious issue -- I can’t remember
when last it’s taken this long to resolve a technical problem,”
 Ferdi Heyneke , an equity trader at Afrifocus Securities Ltd.,
said by telephone. “For us it doesn’t only result in a
potential loss of revenue but also the loss of trading
opportunities.”  
 South Africa’s stock market halted equity trading for the
longest period in at least eight years on July 14, 2008, opening
at 3:10 p.m. after a network problem prevented data from being
disseminated, costing brokers lost sales. The problem affected
data, including the Stock Exchange News Service and equity
trading from the 9 a.m. open until late that afternoon.
