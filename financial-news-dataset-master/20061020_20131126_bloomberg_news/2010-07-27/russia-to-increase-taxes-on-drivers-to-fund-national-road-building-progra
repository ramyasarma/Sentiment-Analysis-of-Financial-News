             Russia will set up a federal fund to
upgrade the country’s roads by increasing taxes on drivers,
Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said.  
 The 2011 budget will set aside 377 billion rubles ($12.5
billion) for road construction and maintenance, with the
allotment rising to 408 billion rubles two years later, Kudrin
told reporters in Moscow today. The main sources of funding will
come from additional gasoline and vehicle taxes, he said.  
 “Road construction remains Russia’s most pressing
problem,” Kudrin said. He said an annual tax hike of 1 ruble
per liter of gasoline over three years won’t fuel inflation.  
 Russia, the world’s largest country by area, still doesn’t
have a complete east-west highway, and roads often turn into
rutted tracks outside urban centers. The state monopolizes road
building, causing construction costs to be 28 percent higher in
Russia than in the U.S., business lobby  Delovaya Rossiya  and the
VTsIOM polling center found in a joint study two years ago.  
 By 2015, 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) of the country’s
54,000 kilometers of federal highways will be brought into a
“normative condition,” and 14,000 kilometers of new roads will
be built, Transportation Minister  Igor Levitin  said today.  
 All villages with a population over 125 will get hard-
surface roads starting next year, according to Levitin.  
 Russia will meet a “strategic” goal of connecting Moscow
to Vladivostok on the Pacific Ocean this year via a  “safe,
normal” highway , Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said in April.
The two cities have been connected by a 9,300-kilometer long
rail link for almost a century.
