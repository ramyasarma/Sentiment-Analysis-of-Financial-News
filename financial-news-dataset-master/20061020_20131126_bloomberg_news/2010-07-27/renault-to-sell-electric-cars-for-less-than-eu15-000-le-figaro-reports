             Renault SA  plans to sell its Zoe
electric car starting mid-2012 for less than 15,000 euros
($19,500) ,  Le Figaro  reported, citing an unidentified company
official.  
 The cost of the Zoe is about the same as a diesel-fueled
model of similar size, the newspaper said.  
 The price includes a 5,000-euro credit from the government
and buyers will have to pay 100 euros a month to rent the
battery for the car, the newspaper said.  
 About 150,000 models will be produced annually at the
company’s plant in Flins, France, Figaro said.
