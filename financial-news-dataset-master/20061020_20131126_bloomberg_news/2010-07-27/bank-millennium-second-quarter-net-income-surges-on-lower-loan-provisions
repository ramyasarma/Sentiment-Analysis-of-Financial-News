             Bank Millennium SA , the Polish unit
of Banco Comercial Portugues SA, said second-quarter profit rose
almost eightfold after provisions for bad loans dropped and
interest income more than doubled.  
 Net income climbed to 69.5 million zloty ($22.5 million),
the highest level in almost two years, from 8.9 million zloty a
year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said today in a regulatory
statement. That’s in line with the 64.7 million-zloty  estimate 
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The lender, which raised 1.06 billion zloty in a share sale
this year, is seeking to increase its share of retail banking in
Poland to 7 percent and to about 5 percent of the corporate
market within three years.  
 The company raised its lending margin in the quarter, which
helped it more than double net interest income to 217.9 million
zloty. Provisions for bad loans dropped 16 percent to 46.8
million zloty, the lender said.  
 Bank Millennium rose 1.7 percent 4.83 zloty as of 9:02 a.m.
in Warsaw trading.
