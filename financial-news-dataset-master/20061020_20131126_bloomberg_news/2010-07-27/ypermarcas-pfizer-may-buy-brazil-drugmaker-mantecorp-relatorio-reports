             Hypermarcas SA  and Pfizer Inc. are
considering buying Mantecorp, a Brazilian maker of generic
drugs,  Relatorio Reservado  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  
 Hypermarcas declined to comment on the report because it’s
in a silent period before its bond sale, outside communications
company Maquina da Noticia told Bloomberg News today. An
official at Pfizer’s U.K. press office wasn’t immediately able
to comment.  
 The Rio de Janeiro-based newsletter said Pfizer declined to
comment.
