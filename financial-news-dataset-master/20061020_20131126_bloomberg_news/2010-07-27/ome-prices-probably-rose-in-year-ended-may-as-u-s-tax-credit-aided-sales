-- Home Prices in 20 U.S. Cities Probably Increased as Tax Credit Aided Sales

             Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose
in May from a year earlier as a government tax credit
temporarily underpinned sales, economists forecast a report to
show today.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property  values  increased 3.9
percent from May 2009, according to the  median  of 26 projections
in a Bloomberg News survey. Another report may show consumer
confidence dropped in July to a five-month low.  
 A retreat in demand since the April 30 contract-signing
deadline to be eligible for an incentive worth up to $8,000
signals home prices will slacken in coming months. Mounting
foreclosures may add to the pressure on property values,
pointing to decreases in home equity that will hurt consumer
spending and economic growth.  
 “The federal homebuyers tax credit has been an important
stimulus to demand and it’s unclear whether prices will remain
stable once that stimulus is gone,” said  Zach Pandl , an
economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York.
“When you look at fundamentals in the housing market they still
look pretty poor. You have limited demand and a lot of supply.”  
 The home-price figures are due at 9 a.m. New York time.
Estimates ranged from increases of 2.9 percent to 5.1 percent,
after a 3.8 percent gain in the 12 months to April.  
 At 10 a.m., a report from the Conference Board, a New York-
based research group, may show its  consumer confidence  index
fell to 51 this month from 52.9 in June, according to the survey
median. Estimates ranged from 46 to 55.5. The measure averaged
45 in 2009 and 98 during the expansion that ended in December
2007.  
 Monthly Changes  
 The Case-Shiller home-price gauge rose 0.2 percent in May
from the  prior month  after climbing 0.4 percent in April,
according to the survey median. The measure advanced from June
2009, the first increase in more than two years, through
January, and retreated in February and March.  
 The year-over-year measure provides better indications of
trends in prices, the group has said. The panel includes  Karl Case  and  Robert Shiller , the economists who created the index.  
 Sales of existing houses reached an almost three-year high
in November, the month the government’s tax incentive was
originally due to expire. Since the extension lapsed on April
30, demand has again retreated.  
 Builder shares rose yesterday after sales of new houses
posted a bigger-than-projected rebound following an
unprecedented slump in May. At a 330,000 annual pace, the  level 
was still the second-lowest in figures going back to 1963.  
 Builder Shares  
 The Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite  Homebuilder Index ,
which includes Toll Brothers Inc. and Lennar Corp., increased
2.9 percent yesterday. The gain brought it to the highest level
since June 17.  
 With the April 30 deadline for signing a contract now past,
it will be up to advances in the labor market to support home
sales. Companies added 83,000 jobs in June, fewer than
economists had forecast, and initial jobless claims signal
firings remain elevated.  
 Another challenge to new-home sales is the rising tide of
foreclosures. Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, RealtyTrac Inc. said last week,
putting lenders on pace to claim more than 1 million properties
this year.  
 NVR Inc. , based in Reston, Virginia, said last week the
original June 30 closing deadline to qualify for the tax
incentive resulted in a “surge in settlement activity” in the
second quarter, with closings jumping 63 percent from the same
time a year earlier. BY contracts, new orders fell six percent
in the period.
