             Hog futures rose for the fourth time
in five sessions on speculation that demand from U.S.
meatpackers will increase as profit margins on pork sales
improve. Cattle also gained.  
 Wholesale pork  climbed to 86.74 cents a pound yesterday,
the highest price since June 1, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Meatpackers are making about $10 per slaughtered hog,
up from $5 to $6 last week, said  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. The price of hogs for  immediate delivery 
to packers rose 1.5 percent yesterday to 79.32 cents a pound.  
 “The packer out here is making money, so he has the money
to share,” Roose said from West Des Moines, Iowa. “We’ve got
good domestic pork demand. That’s what seems to be the force
behind it. The export pace continues to be OK.”  
 Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.75 cent, or 1
percent, to 76.225 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price tumbled 2 percent yesterday, after climbing
1.8 percent last week.  
 The supply of hogs available to meatpackers may be about
2.6 percent less than a year earlier through August, based on
animal weights provided by the USDA in its June 25 inventory
report, said  Doug Harper , an analyst with Brock Associates in
Milwaukee. Some hogs listed as weighing 120 pounds to 179 pounds
(81.2 kilograms) in the report may be ready to process now, he
said.  
 ‘Solid’ Cash Market  
 “The cash market looks to be on solid footing for another
four to six weeks,” Harper said. “That’s based on recent
strength in the wholesale market, and we should have very
manageable kills through August.”  
 Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.15 cent, or 0.2
percent, to 93.925 cents a pound. The most-active contract is up
4.3 percent this month. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement dropped 0.05 cent to $1.149 a pound on the CME.  
 Wholesale  choice beef  prices climbed to $1.5562 a pound at
midday, the highest level since July 7, USDA data show.  
 Live cattle earlier fell as much as 0.2 percent on
speculation that declines in meatpacker profit will curb demand,
because gains in wholesale beef have trailed a jump in spot
prices, Harper said.  Cash steers  traded at about 94.79 cents a
pound last week, up 4.2 percent from four weeks  earlier .
Wholesale choice-beef prices last week were little changed from
the final week in June.  
 “Packer margins have shrunk to almost nothing,” Harper
said. “I’m not sure the packer is going to be willing to keep
the cash market up in the mid-90s very much longer.”
