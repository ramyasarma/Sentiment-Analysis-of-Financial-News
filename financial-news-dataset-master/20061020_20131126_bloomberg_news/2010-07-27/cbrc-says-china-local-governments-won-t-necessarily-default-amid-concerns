             Bank loans to the financing vehicles
of local Chinese governments that have been described in media
reports as having “serious repayment risks” won’t neccesarily
become non-performing, the China Banking Regulatory Commission
said in an e-mailed statement today. The agency didn’t identify
the media reports.  
 Risks involved with these loans can be contained through
measures to secure repayment, the regulator said. Such loans are
typically backed by collateral and guarantees, the regulator
said.
