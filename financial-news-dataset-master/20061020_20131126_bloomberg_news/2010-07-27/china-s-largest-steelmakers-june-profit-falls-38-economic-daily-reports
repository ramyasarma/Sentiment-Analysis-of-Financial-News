             China’s 77 largest steelmakers’
profit fell 38 percent in June on a month earlier because of
lower prices, the Economic Information Daily reported today,
citing an unidentified China Iron & Steel Association official.  
 The combined profit of the mills last month was 6.25
billion yuan ($922 million), the report said.
