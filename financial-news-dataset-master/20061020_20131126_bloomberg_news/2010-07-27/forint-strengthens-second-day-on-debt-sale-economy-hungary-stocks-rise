             The forint strengthened for a second
day after Hungary sold more debt than planned at an auction and
a report indicated that German consumer-confidence is improving.
Stocks and bonds also gained.  
 The forint appreciated 1.2 percent to 283.15 per euro as of
5:39 p.m. in Budapest, the most among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Bonds rose, sending the yield
on the country’s debt maturing in February 2013 down 13 basis
points to 6.94 percent. The  BUX Index  jumped 2.1 percent to
close at 22,660.05.  
 Hungary raised 50 billion forint ($228 million) of Treasury
bills maturing on Nov. 3. That was 5 billion forint more than
planned, according to the debt management agency’s Bloomberg
page. Last week the country fell short of its target at a sale
of three-month bills. GfK AG’s  consumer sentiment index , based
on the market research company’s survey of 2,000 people, will
climb to 3.9 from a revised 3.6 in July, the Nuremberg-based
market research company said in a statement today.  
 “We had all the bad news for now, and the forint is
getting some relief from a positive mood in the global
markets,” said  Gaelle Blanchard , an emerging-market strategist
at Societe Generale SA in London.  
 The forint slid to an almost 15-month low of 292.07 per
euro on July 19 after the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union ended talks with government officials July 17
without endorsing Hungary’s plans for controlling the budget
deficit. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service said
July 23 they may downgrade the country’s debt rating. The forint
is the world’s worst-performing currency against the euro in the
past three months, having lost 8.1 percent from April 26 through
yesterday.
