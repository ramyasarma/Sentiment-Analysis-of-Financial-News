             Spanish cyclist Ruben Lobato was
suspended for two years after his so-called biological passport
showed irregular blood readings.  
 Lobato was suspended by the Spanish Cycling Federation,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the Union Cycliste
Internationale, the sport’s Aigle, Switzerland-based ruling
body.  
 The passport program was set up two years ago. While there
is no doping test ready for illegally transfusing one’s own
blood, experts say irregular swings in blood markers like
hemoglobin can indicate cheating. Some athletes try to raise
stamina by increasing their volume of oxygen-carrying red blood
cells.
