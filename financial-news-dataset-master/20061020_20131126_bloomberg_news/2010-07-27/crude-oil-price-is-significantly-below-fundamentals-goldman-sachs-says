             Crude oil prices are
“significantly” below the level warranted by fundamentals,
offering hedging opportunities for this year and next, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said.  
 The balance between supply and demand in oil will continue
to tighten in the second half of this year as global economic
growth may boost demand, returning inventories to “more
normal” levels toward the end of the year,  David Greely , a
New York-based analyst, wrote in a report dated July 26.  
 Goldman reduced its near-term price forecast to the lower
end of its targeted $85-$95 a barrel range for the second half
of this year because of higher inventories and “still-fragile”
sentiment in the market.  
 “We continue to expect improving fundamentals will provide
additional support to prices,”  Greely said. Goldman earlier
this year recommended buying December 2010 West Texas
Intermediate on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $77.75 a
barrel. This contract was trading at $80.31 a barrel at 12:01
p.m. in Singapore, $1.40 higher than that for delivery in
September.
