             Japanese  bonds  declined, pushing up
10-year yields the most in two months, after advancing stocks
and an improving outlook for corporate earnings reduced demand
for the safety of government debt.  
 Benchmark  yields  climbed from near a seven-year low as
Tokyo-based  Canon Inc.  reported earnings that beat analysts’
estimates and the yen slid to its weakest level in two months
against the euro. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained the most
in two weeks, paring its loss this year to 7.5 percent.  
 “With a halt in the yen’s appreciation and decline in
stocks, bond investors are taking a breather,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist in Tokyo at Toyota Asset Management
Co., which oversees about $15 billion.  
 The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year bond rose 3.5 basis
points to 1.09 percent as of 4:02 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
1.1 percent security due in June 2020 fell 0.314 yen to 100.089
yen. It was the biggest gain in 10-year yields since May 27.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery dropped 0.31
to 141.55 in Tokyo, the lowest closing level since July 14.  
 Yields slid to 1.045 percent on July 22, the lowest since
August 2003, from a five-month high of 1.405 percent on April 7.  
 The Nikkei 225 rose 2.7 percent today, the biggest gain
among equity indexes in Asia. Canon yesterday reported net
income more than  quadrupled  for the three months ended June 30.  
 The yen declined 0.4 percent to 114.68 per euro, paring its
advance this year to 16 percent. A stronger yen reduces the
value of overseas sales at Japanese companies.  
 Foreign Exodus  
 Yields may surge if Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  Naoto Kan
fails to carry out financial reforms, prompting an exodus of
foreign money that had been drawn to the safety of the nation’s
assets, Barclays Capital Japan Ltd. said.  
 Stable returns, low volatility and ample demand create a
“virtuous circle” that supports Japan’s debt market,  Tetsufumi Yamakawa , co-head of Japan research at Barclays in Tokyo, said
in a forum yesterday.  
 “The Greek and European debt crisis has drawn investor
focus to the sovereign markets of many countries, and overseas
investors aren’t so bearish on JGBs,” Yamakawa said.  
 Japan’s 700 trillion yen ($8 trillion) in bonds have a
“peculiar ownership condition,” he said, with groups such as
retirement funds and Japan Post Bank holding about 60 percent of
the total. Pension funds are starting to divest as the
population gets older, meaning purchases by the Bank of Japan
and overseas investors must increase over the long term, he said.
