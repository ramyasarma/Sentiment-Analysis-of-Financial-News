             China is unlikely to raise interest
rates or introduce additional tightening measures for the
property market this year, helping to support the nation’s 
stock market, UBS AG said.  
 Chinese leaders, speaking in a statement issued last week
after a meeting on the economy, signaled a “subtle change” in
tone, UBS economist  Wang Tao  wrote in a report distributed today.
The key phrase used by Chinese leaders was policy stability, not
reversal, Wang wrote.  
 “We think the government will maintain the current macro
 policy stance , with no rate hike this year or additional
property tightening measures,” Wang wrote in the report. The
shift in tone isn’t a signal that current tightening measures
will be reversed, she wrote.  
 Premier  Wen Jiabao  vowed to make “policy stability” the
main theme of the second half and highlighted the importance of
expanding domestic consumption in the statement issued after the
July 20 meeting. China’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index  has
gained more than 8 percent this month.  
 Economic growth  in China eased to 10.3 percent in the
second quarter from 11.9 percent in the first three-month period
of this year. The pace of expansion may decline to 8 percent to
8.5 percent in the fourth quarter, UBS’s Wang estimated.  
 China is unlikely to introduce a property tax “any time
soon” and may delay an interest rate increase until the second
quarter of next year, Wang wrote.
