             India’s benchmark  bonds  rose for a
second day before a central bank policy meeting today at which
borrowing costs are forecast to climb.  
 The Reserve Bank of India will raise its reverse repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point when it announces the
outcome of its review at 11:30 a.m. local time, according to all
20 economists in a Bloomberg survey. That may help temper
inflation, which exceeded 10 percent in each of the last five
months. Asia’s third-largest economy needs tighter monetary
policy to help rein in price gains, the central bank said in a
report yesterday.  
 “Policy is going to focus on bringing inflation down,
which has been a concern for a while,” said  Roy Paul , a deputy
general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Investors are
going to be positive and take in their stride a bit of monetary
tightening in the near term.”  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due in May 2020 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.65 percent as of
9:40 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The price rose 0.11, or 11 paise per 100 rupee face
amount, to 100.98.  
 The  wholesale-price index  climbed 10.55 percent from a year
earlier in June following a 10.16 percent increase in May.
April’s 11.23 percent jump was the biggest since September 2008.  
 “For containing the inflation persistence and anchoring
inflation expectations, anti-inflationary monetary policy
actions become a necessity,” the Reserve Bank of India said in
yesterday’s report. The bank raised its benchmark interest rates
three times since mid-March, lifting the reverse-repurchase rate
to 4.25 percent and the repurchase rate to 5.75 percent.  
 One-year interest-rate swaps, derivative contracts used to
guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, were little
changed from yesterday. The fixed payment made to receive a
floating rate was 5.92 percent.
