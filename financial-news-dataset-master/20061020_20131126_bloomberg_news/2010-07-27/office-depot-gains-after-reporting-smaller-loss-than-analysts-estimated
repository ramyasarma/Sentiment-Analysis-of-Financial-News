             Office Depot Inc. , the second-
largest U.S. office-supply chain, advanced in early New York
trading after reporting a second-quarter loss that was smaller
than analysts’ estimates.  
 The net loss narrowed to $9.49 million, or 7 cents a share,
from $82.1 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the Boca Raton,
Florida-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected a loss of 17 cents a share, the average of 18
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Sales fell 4.4 percent to $2.7 billion in the 13 weeks
ended June 26, marking the 10th-consecutive year-over-year
quarterly decline. Office Depot said sales at the 1,132 North
American stores open more than a year fell 1 percent. The retail
division had an operating profit of $9 million compared to a
loss of $13 million a year ago, according to the statement.  
 Office Depot advanced 26 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $4.99 at
9:05 a.m. in pre-market  trading . The shares rose 34 cents, or
7.7 percent, to $4.73 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading and had lost 27 percent this year before
today.  
 The retailer said it didn’t submit a bid to renew its
office-supplies contract, worth a projected $515 million in
sales this year, with the U.S. Communities collective because
the terms were “problematic.” The company was awarded the
contract three times, including an agreement reached in 2005
that will end on Jan. 1.  
 Office Depot said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on July 16 that it didn’t submit a bid
because the contract terms would reduce profit margin currently
in the low-single digits or cause a loss.
