             German stocks climbed for a fifth
day after Deutsche Bank AG reported second-quarter earnings that
topped estimates, outweighing declines at SAP AG and Daimler AG.  
 Deutsche Bank rallied 4.5 percent. Fresenius Medical Care
AG, the world’s biggest provider of kidney dialysis, surged 4.9
percent after the U.S. government released new rules on paying
operators of dialysis centers.  Air Berlin Plc  soared 2.7 percent
as Germany’s second-biggest airline said it reached an agreement
with Oneworld Management Co. Ltd. on “key aspects” of becoming
a member of the global alliance.  
 The benchmark  DAX Index  rose 0.2 percent to 6,207.31 at the
5:30 p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt. The measure has risen
4.2 percent this year as equity strategists at UBS AG and
Deutsche Bank advised investors to increase holdings of the
nation’s shares, arguing that they are more geared to global
growth. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index has lost 0.9 percent and
France’s CAC 40 Index 6.9 percent in the same period.  
 “Deutsche reported very well,”  Ralph Silva , a strategist
at London-based Silva Research Network said in a Bloomberg Radio
interview. “If you’re brave, I’d go with the European banks.
That’s where I’d put my money right now.”  
 Deutsche Bank Gains  
 Deutsche Bank AG  gained 4.5 percent to 52.64 euros.
Germany’s largest bank said second-quarter net income increased
to 1.16 billion euros ($1.5 billion), beating the average
analyst estimate of 1.05 billion euros.  
 Fresenius Medical rose 4.9 percent to 43.15 euros. The fee
paid to dialysis centers will decline only 2 percent to $250 to
$260 per treatment, which is a favorable outcome for the
industry, said  Arthur Henderson , an analyst for Jefferies
International Ltd.  
 Air Berlin  gained 2.7 percent to 3.60 euros. The airline’s
agreement with Oneworld will help the carrier increase sales and
lower costs, it said.  
 DAB Bank AG  advanced 1.2 percent to 4.15 euros. The German
online broker controlled by Italy’s UniCredit SpA said profit
climbed 26 percent in the second quarter helped by lower costs.
Net income rose to 6.91 million euros from 5.49 million euros in
the year-earlier period.  
 SAP slid 2.2 percent to 36.43 euros after the world’s
biggest maker of business-management software reported second-
quarter net income of 491 million euros. Analysts had forecast
profit at 525 million euros, the average of 15 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Daimler dropped 4.2 percent to 41.34 euros even after the
world’s second-largest maker of luxury cars raised its 2010
operating profit forecast to 6 billion euros. The stock has
rallied 16 percent this year through yesterday.  
 “Investors are selling on good news,” said  Thomas Nagel ,
a trader at Equinet AG in Frankfurt. “Automobile shares had a
good run in the last few weeks and investors were expecting good
numbers from Daimler. Now that they have those numbers, they’re
selling on them to take profit.”
