             Arcade Fire takes a decisive step
toward rock’s first rank with its new album, out next week.  
 The Canadian alternative band has spent some three years
crafting “The Suburbs,” a CD as ambitious as its lauded
predecessors and more accessible.  
 The starting point is the Woodlands area of Houston, Texas,
where Win and William Butler grew up. There’s the same bleak
world vision as on 2007’s “Neon Bible” -- the new CD’s title
track says “by the time the first bombs fell we were already
bored.” This time, optimism sugars the pill.  
 “I want a daughter while I’m still young,” sings Win
Butler in the same number. “I want to hold her hand and show
her some beauty, before all this damage is done. If it’s too
much to ask then send me a son.” Butler, who’s married to group
member Regine Chassagne, shows that rock -- after decades of
jejune teenage laments -- can be mature. An  act  that made a
debut album about death (“Funeral”) is now firing on all
cylinders.  
 “Month of May” mixes punk fervor with a warning about
audiences “standing with their arms folded tight.” A track of
this quality should excite even the most apathetic listener.  
 Rating: ****.  
 Unlike Arcade Fire,  Eminem  needs little introduction. His
latest album has topped the U.S. charts for a month. On first
play, “Recovery” seems a misleading title. There are many
moments that sound like a retread of the hip-hop that  Marshall Mathers III  has been churning out for years.  
 Still, the CD is a grower. Gems such as “Cinderella Man”
have beguiling wordplay: Eminem boasts about rapping “circles
around square lyricists.” Rise above the stream of four-letter
words, and the raging track “Cold Wind Blows” has its merits.
Guest spots by Lil Wayne,  Pink  and  Rihanna  also help.  
 Rating: ** 1/2.  
 Sting’s  “Symphonicities” offers excellent reworkings of
Police and solo hits with the Royal Philharmonic Concert
Orchestra.  
 The CD captures the raw energy of rehearsals at Abbey Road
Studios, London -- when Sting led a furious version of “Next to
You” and spoke to me for a television interview. It also
exceeds the precision playing at the Metropolitan Opera one hot
evening in New York this month, where we applauded the apposite
“An Englishman in New York.”  
 This CD could so easily have ended up as Muzak. Instead,
it’s a genuine recasting by a 58-year-old singer who also shows
that rock can grow up and continue to rage articulately.  
 Rating: *** 1/2.  
 Even Sting can’t beat  Laurie Anderson , whose “Homeland”
at London’s  Barbican  was a standout show in 2008. “Only an
Expert” was stunning, with a biting lyric commenting on the
dangers of too much specialized knowledge -- whether in global
warming or financial disaster.  
 Anderson, now 63, has released the recording and it’s about
the best thing she has done, surpassing the experimental heights
of her debut “Big Science” back in 1982. The CD is topped off
with feedback guitar from her husband  Lou Reed .  
 Rating: ****.  
 Slash, “Slash.” There were high hopes for the Guns N’
Roses guitar hero when he decided to try a solo career away from
his latest band,  Velvet Revolver .  
 On paper, the project looks interesting: there are guest
appearances by Ian Astbury,  Ozzy Osbourne ,  Fergie ,  Lemmy
Kilmister ,  Kid Rock  and  Iggy Pop . On record, it doesn’t gel.
Slash crashes through genres, plays guitar and plays guitar some
more. Yes, we get it, Slash. You’re a great soloist. Now make a
good record.  
 Rating: *.  

 
What the Stars Mean:
****       Excellent
***        Good
**         Average
*          Poor
(No stars) Worthless
