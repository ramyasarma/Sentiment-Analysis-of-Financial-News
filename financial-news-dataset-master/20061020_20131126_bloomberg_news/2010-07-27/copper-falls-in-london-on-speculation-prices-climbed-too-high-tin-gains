             Copper prices fell for the first
time in seven sessions on speculation that a fragile economy
will limit demand for the metal used in homes, cars and
appliances.  
 U.S. consumer confidence fell to a five-month low in July,
indicating a weak labor market will limit the economy’s
recovery. Copper has dropped 4.2 percent this year on concern
the global recovery would falter.  
 “I’m really surprised by the recent rally for copper,”
said  Gijsbert Groenewegen , a partner at Gold Arrow Capital
Management in New York. “People need to understand that if you
don’t improve consumer spending and unemployment, the economy is
not going to be so strong.”  
 Copper futures for September delivery fell 1.65 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $3.2065 a pound on the Comex in New York. The
metal gained 10 percent in the previous six sessions as
inventories declined.  
 Stockpiles  monitored by the London Metal Exchange have
dropped 8.3 percent in July, heading for the biggest slide since
June 2009.  
 “Even though there have been some changes in sentiment,
the economic conditions are still weak,”  Steve Lehman , a senior
portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, said in
an interview last week. “I’m pessimistic about the intermediate
prospects for global growth and industrial commodities.”  
 Copper for delivery in three months slumped $90, or 1.3
percent, to $7,059 a metric ton ($3.20 a pound) on the LME.  
 Aluminum was unchanged, while nickel, tin, lead and zinc
fell.
