             Copper may rally 3.9 percent to the
highest price since early May after closing above the
“neckline” in a technical double-bottom formation, according
to strategists at Citigroup Inc.  
 The attached chart shows that the metal fell to an eight-
month low on the Comex in New York of $2.72 a pound on June 7,
rallied for almost a month, and then slumped to a three-week low
of $2.8555 on July 1. Copper probably will rally to $3.35 in the
“short term,” after closing above the “neckline” at $3.10 on
July 22, Citigroup’s  Tom Fitzpatrick  and  Shyam Devani  wrote in a
report dated yesterday.  
 A rise to $3.35 would be the highest price for a most-
active contract since May 3. Copper for September delivery
gained 3.8 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.223 a pound yesterday on
the Comex.  
 The line that connects the peaks between troughs is the so-
called neckline. In technical analysis, investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  
 The metal may also rally to the more “aggressive target”
of $3.46, the analysts said, citing a reverse head-and-shoulders
trading pattern. The pattern is formed when a security makes
three consecutive troughs, with the middle being the lowest.
