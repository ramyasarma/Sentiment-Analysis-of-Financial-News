             Tampa Bay’s  Matt Garza  threw the
first  no-hitter  in team history and the fifth of the Major
League Baseball season as the Rays beat the Detroit Tigers 5-0.  
 Garza faced the minimum batters last night at Tropicana
Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, walking  Brennan Boesch  in the
second inning for Detroit’s only base-runner before  Ryan Raburn 
hit into a double-play to end the inning.  
 Garza, 26, threw 120 pitches and struck out six, retiring
pinch-hitter  Ramon Santiago  on a fly ball to right field that
was caught by  Ben Zobrist  to end the game. Garza said he didn’t
realize he was on the verge of history until the ninth inning.  
 “Everything just was right tonight and it feels great,”
Garza said in a televised interview after the game. “I just
went out there and attacked the (strike) zone.”  
 The right-hander improved to 11-5 this season.  Max Scherzer 
(7-8) took the loss for Detroit, losing his own no-hitter on a
grand slam by  Matt Joyce  with two outs in the sixth inning.  
 Zobrist also leapt to catch a ball over his head after
running it down in deep right field in the third inning.  
 “We played great defense,” Garza said. “It’s a lot
easier to play when those guys play the way they did.”  
 The Rays, who have twice been held hitless this season,
improved to 60-38 with the win, while the Tigers fell to 51-47.  
 Most Since ‘91  
 This season’s five no-hitters are the most in the major
leagues since seven were thrown in 1990 and 1991.  
 The previous was June 25 by Arizona Diamondbacks’  Edwin Jackson , who needed 149 pitches.  Ubaldo Jimenez  threw this
season’s first no-hitter April 17 as the Colorado Rockies beat
Atlanta 4-0. Oakland’s  Dallas Braden  tossed a perfect game in
the Athletics’ 4-0 win over the Rays on May 9 and the
Philadelphia Phillies’  Roy Halladay  also was perfect in a 1-0
win over the Florida Marlins on May 29.  
 Detroit’s  Armando Galarraga  narrowly missed throwing a
perfect game in June when the 27th and final out was incorrectly
ruled an infield hit.  
 The San Diego Padres and New York Mets are the only major-
league clubs to have never thrown a no-hitter.
