             Kuwait’s benchmark index rose for
the fifth day, leading gains in the Persian Gulf, as Commercial
Bank of Kuwait and  Boubyan Bank KSC  returned to profit. Dubai
shares declined.  
 The  Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  gained 0.5 percent to
6,677.70, bringing the 5-day advance to 2.9 percent. The measure
has lost 4.6 percent this year.  Commercial Bank of Kuwait , the
country’s second-biggest bank by market value, climbed the most
in a week.  Boubyan Bank , the Kuwaiti Islamic lender, also rose
after posting a profit. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  advanced 0.2
percent at 1:39 p.m. in Kuwait City.  
 “Company earnings are positive, boosting the market with
liquidity,” said  Jasem Al Zeraei , head of institutional sales
at NBK capital in Kuwait. “There is more positive news from the
government in the form of fiscal spending, spending on mega
projects.”  
 Kuwait’s parliament June 30 approved a budget for the
fiscal year through March 2011 that increases spending as the
government seeks to boost economic growth by developing
infrastructure. The country’s inflation slowed to 2.8 percent in
April from 2.9 percent the previous month, according to data
posted on the Central Statistical Office website today.  
 In Europe, stocks rose for a sixth day as UBS AG and
Deutsche Bank AG reported earnings that beat estimates and the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision softened some of its
proposed capital and liquidity rules. Asian shares and U.S.
index futures also advanced.  
 Profit  
 Commercial Bank of Kuwait rose 1.1 percent to 910 fils. The
lender posted a profit of 2.3 million dinars ($8 million) in the
second quarter after a loss of 2.32 million dinars in the year-
earlier period. Boubyan Bank increased 2 percent to 520 fils as
it said second-quarter profit was 1.4 million dinars after a
loss in the second quarter of 2009.  
 Dubai’s  DFM General Index  lost 0.7 percent to 1,498.78, the
lowest close in almost three weeks. Bahrain’s  gauge  fell 0.4
percent.  
 Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index  advanced 0.4
percent, Oman’s  MSM 30 Index  increased 0.7 percent and Qatar’s 
QE Index  gained 0.3 percent. Abu Dhabi’s gauge added less than
0.1 percent.
