             Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, found more evidence of oil in an
onshore well in Brazil’s Seriema field, the Brazilian petroleum
regulator said.  
 The discovery was made at the 3BRSA853ES well in the
Espirito Santo basin, the National Petroleum Agency said on its
website. The Seriema field was declared a commercial find in
December 2006.
