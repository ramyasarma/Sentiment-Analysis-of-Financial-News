             Hindustan Unilever Ltd. , India’s
biggest household products maker, said profit fell in the
first quarter as the company increased spending on
advertisements and reduced prices to fend off competition.  
 Net income decreased 1.8 percent to 5.33 billion rupees
($114 million) in the three months ended June 30, from 5.43
billion rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said
in a statement today. The result is in line with the 5.35
billion rupee  average  of 24 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Hindustan Unilever  is increasing spending on
advertisements and promotions after cutting prices of some
products by as much as 29 percent in January to win customers
from  Procter & Gamble Co.  and Kolkata-based  ITC Ltd.   
 “The company has spent heavily on advertisements across
categories to increase sales because of competition from
Procter & Gamble in the laundry segment and ITC in soaps,”
said  Anand Shah , an analyst at Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai
with a “reduce” rating on the stock. “Profitability won’t
improve unless they get back the pricing power.”  
 The  shares  fell 0.1 percent to 261.65 rupees at 3:23 p.m.
in Mumbai. The benchmark  Sensitive Index  rose 0.7 percent.  
 Sales Gains  
 Sales rose 7.1 percent to 47.9 billion rupees in the
first quarter, less than the 48.4 billion rupee average of
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Profit before interest and tax from sales of soaps and
detergents fell 35 percent to 2.49 billion rupees on price
reductions.  Revenue  from these items gained 2.4 percent to
22.6 billion rupees as lower prices attracted more buyers.  
 “Competitive activity has further intensified and has
spread out to even more categories than before,” Chief
Financial Officer R. Sridhar said today. “Our strategy will
be to very, very determinedly defend our leadership position
and when there is a rise in competitive intensity we will
respond as appropriate.”  
 Advertising spending rose 34 percent to 7.51 billion
rupees, or about 16 percent of sales, from about 13 percent
in the year earlier.  
 Creams, Toothpaste  
 Profit  before interest and tax from personal care
products such as skin creams and toothpaste rose 26 percent
to 3.39 billion rupees.  
 Sales of Fair & Lovely skin cream, Pepsodent toothpastes
and other personal care products rose 11 percent to 13.7
billion rupees.  
 The company’s London and Rotterdam-based parent,
 Unilever , owns about 52 percent of the Indian unit and
started selling Sunlight soap in the country in 1888.
