             The number of  jobseekers  in France
fell in June, a sign the nation’s economic recovery prompted
companies to hire.  
 The  number of unemployed  actively looking for work fell by
8,600 last month, a drop of 0.3 percent, the Labor and Finance
ministries said in a statement today in Paris. The total number
of jobseekers was 2.7 million, still the highest since May 2005.  
 The decline is the second this year, after a drop of 6,600
in March, and reflects a strengthening rebound from France’s
worst recession since World War II.  PSA Peugeot Citroen  has said
in recent weeks that it is  adding night shifts  at plants across
France and elsewhere to meet renewed demand for its cars.  
 Jobless claims have been increasing since March 2008, when
the total was as low as 1.9 million. French Finance Minister
 Christine Lagarde  has repeatedly predicted that job growth would
return to France in the second half of 2010.
