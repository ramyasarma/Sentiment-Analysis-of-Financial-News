             Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose
more than forecast in May from a year earlier as a government
tax credit temporarily underpinned sales.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of  property values  increased 4.6
percent from May 2009, the biggest year-over-year gain since
August 2006, the group said today in New York. Another report
showed consumer confidence dropped this month to the lowest
level since February.  
 A retreat in demand since the April 30 contract-signing
deadline to be eligible for an incentive worth up to $8,000
raises the risk home prices will slacken in coming months. The
lowest mortgage rates on record are making houses more
affordable, which may help overcome some of the effect of the
mounting  foreclosure s that are pressuring property values.  
 “We just are going to muddle through for a while,” said
 Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in
New York, who forecast the index would rise 4.5 percent, the
closest of those surveyed. “I’m not looking for big movement
from here either up or down.”  
 The Conference Board, a New York-based research group, said
today its consumer  confidence measure  dropped to 50.4 in July
from a revised 54.3 the prior month. Growing concern over the
outlook for incomes and the economy over the next six months
depressed the index.  
 Shares Rise  
 Stocks rose after the reports on improving corporate
earnings. The Standard & Poor’s  500 Index  climbed 0.4 percent to
1,118.86 at 10:03 a.m. in New York. Treasury securities dropped,
sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note up to 3.04
percent from 2.99 percent late yesterday.  
 Economists forecast the home-price index would rise 3.9
percent after a 3.8 percent year-over-year increase in April,
according to the  median  of 26 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates ranged from 2.9 percent to 5.1 percent. Year-
over-year records began in 2001.  
 The gauge rose 0.5 percent in May from the  prior month 
after adjusting for seasonal variations, following an April
increase of 0.6 percent. Unadjusted prices climbed 1.3 percent
from the prior month.  
 The year-over-year measure provides better indications of
trends in prices, the group has said. The panel includes Karl
Case and Robert Shiller, the economists who created the index.  
 California Rebounds  
 Thirteen of the 20 cities in the S&P/Case-Shiller index
showed a year-over-year increase, led by an 18 percent gain in
San Francisco and a 12 percent increase in San Diego.  
 Compared with the prior month, 19 of the 20 areas covered
showed an increase on an unadjusted basis, led by a 2.8 percent
gain in Minneapolis and a 2 percent advance in Atlanta. Las
Vegas was the only city to show a month-over-month drop.  
 “There may still be some residual impact from the
homebuyers’ tax credit,”  David Blitzer , chairman of the index
committee at S&P, said in a statement. “It still looks possible
that the housing market might bounce along the bottom for the
foreseeable future, before showing any real improvement that
will filter through to the rest of the economy.”  
 Sales of  existing houses  reached an almost three-year high
in November, the month the government’s tax incentive was
originally due to expire. Since the extension lapsed on April
30, demand has again retreated.  
 Jobs Needed  
 With the April 30 deadline for signing a contract now past,
it will be up to advances in the labor market to support home
sales. Private U.S. companies added 83,000 jobs in June, fewer
than economists had forecast, and initial jobless claims have
averaged 449,700 this month, a sign firings remain elevated.  
 Another challenge to new home sales is the rising tide of
foreclosures. Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, RealtyTrac Inc. said last week,
putting lenders on pace to claim more than 1 million properties
this year.  
 NVR Inc., based in Reston, Virginia, said last week the
original June 30 closing deadline to qualify for the tax
incentive resulted in a “surge in settlement activity” in the
second quarter, with closings jumping 63 percent from the same
time a year earlier. BY contracts, new orders fell six percent
in the period.  
 A drop in borrowing costs is helping to mitigate the
decrease in housing demand. The average rate on a fixed 30-year
mortgage dropped to 4.56 percent last week, the lowest since
data began in 1972, according to figures from Freddie Mac.
