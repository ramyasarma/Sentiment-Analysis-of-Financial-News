             North Korea’s soccer team was
reprimanded this month on its return to Pyongyang for losing all
three of its World Cup matches and “betraying the trust” of
Kim Jong Un, son of leader Kim Jong Il, Radio Free Asia said,
citing unidentified people.  
 Team members were placed on a stage in front of an audience
of more than 400, including the nation’s sports minister and
Workers’ Party officials, Radio Free Asia reported on its
website. The players, who were criticized by other athletes and
a sports commentator, were then made to censure head coach Kim
Jong Hun, according to the report.   
 The team’s two Japan-born players, Jong Tae Se and An Yong
Hak, were exempt from the six-hour session, Radio Free Asia
said.
