             Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA plans
to strengthen its capital ratio after it passed a stress test
with a capital buffer of less than 235 million euros ($303
million), Il Sole 24 ore reported citing an interview with
General Manager Antonio Vigni.  
 Monte dei Paschi improved its Tier 1 capital ratio by 25
basis points with the sale of 75 branches, may add 40 points
with the reshuffle of its real estate properties and will also
benefit from the reorganization of its asset management
division, Vigni told the Italian daily.
