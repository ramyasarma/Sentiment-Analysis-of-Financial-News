             Coffee prices fell the most in a
week on speculation that a bigger harvest in Brazil, the world’s
largest producer, will spur sales by producers. Cocoa gained.  
 Brazil’s coffee output may jump 19 percent from a year
earlier as trees enter the higher-yielding phase of a two-year
cycle, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Major growing
regions will be dry through July 30, which is “good for
harvesting,” said  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Futures Group Inc. in Chicago.  
 “We’re seeing a constant battle between producer selling
and a drawdown in exchange stocks,” said  Hector Galvan , a
senior trading adviser at  RJO Futures  in Chicago. Sales by
Brazilian farmers can drive prices down 15 percent from the
current level, he said.  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 1.85 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $1.6375 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 20. The
commodity has declined 7.2 percent since reaching a 12-year high
of $1.765 on June 24.  
 On London’s Liffe exchange, robusta-coffee futures for
September delivery declined $24, or 1.4 percent, to $1,699 a
metric ton.  
 Cocoa futures for September delivery rose $7, or 0.2
percent, to $2,980 a ton in New York.  
 In London, cocoa futures for September delivery climbed 1
pound to 2,280 pounds ($3,550) a ton.
