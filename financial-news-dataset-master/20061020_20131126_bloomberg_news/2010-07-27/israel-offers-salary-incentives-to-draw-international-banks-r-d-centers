             Israel is trying to lure
international banks to set up research and development centers
in the country by offering to pay part of the employees’
salaries, Finance Ministry Director General  Haim Shani  said.  
 Israel’s government will pay as much as 50 percent of the
workers’ wages at the banks’ R&D units for up to five years,
Shani said in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters office in
New York yesterday. The incentive will vary depending on whether
the centers will be based in the central part of the country or
in the periphery as well as on the level of salary, he said.  
 “We want to attract large financial services companies,
particularly big banks,” said Shani, 53, who was previously the
chief executive officer of the Israeli maker of digital-
recording products,  Nice Systems Ltd.  “It will make part of
their competitive advantage in the years to come.”  
 Israel wants to capitalize on its technology industry,
whose exports rose an annualized 68 percent in the first 11
months in 2009, to help boost  growth  following the global
economic crisis. The country’s  economy  will grow by 3.6 percent
this year, according to a June 6 Finance Ministry forecast, and
by 3.8 percent next year.  
 Shani is meeting with officials at U.S. financial companies
following meetings in the U.K. a few months ago. He declined to
name any of the banks he will visit.  
 “We are here to listen to what they want and tell them
what we have and what our plans are,” he said.  
 Intel Corp. ’s Israel unit has received $1.2 billion in
grants from the Israeli government since it began manufacturing
in the country 25 years ago. The chipmaker has invested a total
of $7.3 billion in its Israeli operations. The company accounted
for 10 percent of Israel’s industrial exports, Intel Israel’s
General Manager  Maxine Fassberg  said at a press conference in
Tel Aviv on Feb. 8.
