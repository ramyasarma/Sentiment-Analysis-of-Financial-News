             Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the
world’s largest luxury-car maker, must fix the fuel level
sensors on 5-Series sedans sold in the U.S. this year, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.  
 BMW needs to repair the fuel sensors on 6,080 5-Series cars
because the gauge may display that the tank has more fuel than
it actually does, the agency reported on its Web site today.  
 BMW could not be immediately reached for comment.
