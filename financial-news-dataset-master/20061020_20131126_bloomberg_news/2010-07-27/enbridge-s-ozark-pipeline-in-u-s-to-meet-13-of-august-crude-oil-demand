             Enbridge Inc.,  Canada’s largest
pipeline company, said its Ozark pipeline in the U.S. will haul
about 13 percent of the crude oil requested by oil producers,
traders and refiners next month.  
 The Ozark pipeline will run at a capacity of 214,654
barrels a day in August,  Larry Springer , an Enbridge spokesman,
said in an e-mail today. That compared with 198,570 barrels a
day in July, when the pipeline also met 13 percent of shippers’
requests to move oil.  
 Ozark, which transports heavy and low-sulfur oils between
Cushing, Oklahoma, and Wood River, Illinois, is part of
Enbridge’s  Mid-Continent System , which includes more than 480
miles of oil pipelines and 12.8 million barrels of oil storage,
according to the company’s website. Heavier oil has a higher
density.  
 Shippers sometimes inflate their nominations to make sure
they obtain the space they need to transport their oil, and the
company must determine how many of the requests it can meet.  
 Enbridge also said its  Spearhead  pipeline, which mostly
transports heavy Canadian oil in the U.S. Midcontinent, will be
able to move all of the oil requested for next month.  
 The pipeline “is considered full” at 161,932 barrels a
day of capacity, Springer said. It was able to meet demand of
170,775 barrels a day in July without apportioning capacity, he
said last month. Spearhead spans 657 miles (1,058 kilometers)
from Chicago to Cushing, according to the website.  
 Enbridge apportioned space on Spearhead in May and June
after meeting all requests from April 2009 to April 2010.
