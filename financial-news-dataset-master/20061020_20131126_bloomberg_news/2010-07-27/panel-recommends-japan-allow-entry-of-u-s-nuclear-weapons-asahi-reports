             A Japanese government panel will
propose shifting defense policy to allow the transportation of
U.S. nuclear weapons within the country and lift a ban on arms
exports, the Asahi newspaper reported today.  
 The recommendations, in response to threats from North
Korea and the rise of Chinese military spending, will be
submitted to Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  next month. The panel
recommends boosting Japan’s submarine capabilities as Chinese
naval vessels are active in the area, the Asahi said, citing a
draft of the proposal.  
 Kan’s government by December will update national defense
guidelines based on the recommendations of the panel, headed by
 Keihan Electric Railway  chief executive  Shigetaka Sato . Other
recommendations include allowing joint weapons development with
other countries besides the U.S., the paper said.  
 Implementing the proposals would mark a shift away from
Japan’s three anti-nuclear principles of never developing,
possessing or permitting nuclear weapons on its soil. The
principles were adopted after World War II, which ended with the
U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan has also
 barred  the export of weapons since 1976.  
 Japan in March confirmed the existence of long-denied Cold
War agreements that permitted U.S. nuclear-armed warships to
visit the country’s ports. The U.S. provides for Japan’s
security under a 1960 bilateral treaty, and almost 50,000
American troops are stationed on Japanese soil.
