             The Czech government will take
savings measures this year and in 2011 to ensure that it meets
its budget-deficit targets, Finance Minister  Miroslav Kalousek 
said.  
 Without any cuts, the budget gap may reach as much as 6.6
percent of gross domestic product next year, compared with the
target of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2011 and 5.3 percent for this
year, he said.  
 “Understandably it is absolutely out of the question that
the government would allow this to happen,” Kalousek told
reporters today in Prague. He pledged “major systemic changes”
for the budget in 2012.  
 The three-party government, appointed  on July 13, has
committed to reduce the public-finance  deficit  and wants to
bring the shortfall to within the European Union limit of 3
percent of GDP by 2013. Without action now, the budget deficit
may also reach 5.8 percent of GDP this year, Kalousek said.  
 The  budget gap  widened to 5.9 percent of GDP last year when
the global economic crisis cut demand for Czech exports,
including cars made by the local units of Volkswagen AG and
Hyundai Motor Co., pushing the country to the worst recession
since the demise of communism two decades ago.  
 Record Majority  
 The new government has 118 seats in the 200-member lower
house of parliament, giving it the strongest majority since the
country became an independent state in 1993.  
 Moody’s Investors Service said it may increase the Czech
credit rating from the current A1 if the government delivers on
its promise to overhaul the public finances and curb the
deficit.  
 The Cabinet will debate the savings measures tomorrow,
Kalousek said, adding that he wants to propose freezing 2.5
percent of government operating costs for this year.  
 The Finance Ministry forecasts the economy will grow 1.6
percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2011, after a 4.1 percent
contraction in 2009. The European Commission, the European
Union’s executive arm,  estimates  the euro area’s economy will
grow 0.9 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2011.  
 The Czech Republic plans to sell a record 280 billion
koruna ($14.3 billion) of bonds this year, including securities
denominated in foreign currencies, and says debt sales will
increase to 312.9 billion koruna by 2012.
