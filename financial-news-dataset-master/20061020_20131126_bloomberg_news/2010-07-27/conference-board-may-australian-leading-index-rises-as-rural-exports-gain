             An  index  of Australian leading
economic indicators increased in May as rural goods exports
advanced.  
 The New York-based Conference Board’s gauge climbed 0.3
percent to 115.7, according to a report e-mailed to Bloomberg
News today.  
 The leading index uses previously reported statistics and
estimates of economic indicators, such as profits and exports,
to predict the pace of growth in coming months. The Conference
Board, a research group, also compiles indexes for the U.S.,
France, Germany, Japan and the U.K.  
 The index of coincident indicators, which is a gauge of the
current growth rate, rose 0.2 percent to 115.1, today’s report
showed.
