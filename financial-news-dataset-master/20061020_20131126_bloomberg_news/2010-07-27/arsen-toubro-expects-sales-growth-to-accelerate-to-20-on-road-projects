             Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , India’s
biggest engineering company, said sales growth may accelerate in
the year ending March 31 as it wins projects to build roads,
rail network and power plants.  
 The company based in Mumbai  forecasts  sales to expand 20
percent this year after revenue rose 8.3 percent in the 12
months that ended March 31, Executive Vice President for Finance
 R. Shankar Raman  said at a briefing today.  
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government is accelerating
construction of infrastructure projects to boost growth in
Asia’s third-largest economy. India, ranked below war-ravaged
Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka for the quality of infrastructure,
needs to spend $1 trillion on power plants and public work
projects in the five years ending 2017, according to the
nation’s Planning Commission.  
 “Water and hydroelectric projects are areas where Larsen
is interested,” Shankar Raman said. India’s economic growth is
accelerating and governments in the Middle East are spending on
infrastructure projects, which will “all contribute to a
sustained growth in order book.”  
 The company, the third-largest by market value in the  MSCI
AC Asia Pacific excluding Japan Industrials Index , fell 3
percent to 1,862 rupees at close of trading in Mumbai.  
 Larsen & Toubro today said first-quarter net income fell to
6.66 billion rupees ($142.5 million) from 16 billion rupees a
year earlier on the lack of one-time gain. Profit was lower than
the 6.8 billion rupee average  estimate  of 15 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Profit at the company rose 15 percent after taking
out last year’s 10.1 billion rupee gain from selling its cement
unit.  
 Sales in the quarter rose 6.5 percent to 78.4 billion
rupees, the company said in a statement today.  
 The company won contracts valued at 14.4 billion rupees for
the construction of residential and factory buildings, according
to a statement on June 18. Larsen & Toubro on July 14 said it
won the bid to construct the 120 billion rupee Hyderabad Metro
Rail project.
