             Hong Kong stocks  advanced, driving
the Hang Seng Index to a three-month high, as better-than-
estimated U.S. home sales and profit at UBS AG boosted
confidence in the global economy.  
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. , a global fashion retailer, advanced
0.9 percent. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s largest bank, gained
1.7 percent after Swiss lender UBS reported a third consecutive
quarterly profit. China State Construction International
Holdings Ltd. surged 5.7 percent after Citigroup Inc.
recommended investors buy the stock.  
 “A series of mostly positive economic data and better-than
expected company earnings has boosted investor sentiment in
Asia,” said Victoria Mio, a Hong Kong-based senior fund manager
at Robeco Group, which oversees $194 billion. “Whether the
trend can be sustained depends on Asian company earnings due to
be released soon.”  
 The  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.6 percent to 20,973.39 at the
4 p.m. close, after dropping 0.1 percent earlier. The gauge
closed at the highest level since April 30. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index  of so-called H shares of Chinese companies
gained 0.5 percent to 11,931.12.  
 Property developers declined before a government land
auction tomorrow. Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., a Hong Kong-based
developer, dropped 1.4 percent, having surged 8.6 percent in the
last five days.  
 Lower Valuations  
 The Hang Seng Index has dropped 4.1 percent this year as
China’s efforts to cool its property market and Europe’s debt
crises dented confidence in a global economic recovery. Stocks
on the gauge trade at  13.9  times estimated earnings, Bloomberg
data show, down from 17.2 times at the beginning of the year.  
 Esprit climbed 0.9 percent to HK$47.15. Techtronic
Industries Co., maker of Hoover vacuum cleaners and Ryobi power
tools, climbed 3.1 percent to HK$6.57.  Li & Fung Ltd. , the
biggest supplier to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
rose 0.7 percent to HK$36.10.  
 New U.S. home purchases increased 24 percent from May to an
annual pace of 330,000, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an advance of 3.3 percent to 310,000.  
 Investor sentiment was also boosted after FedEx Corp.
joined rival United Parcel Service Inc. in boosting its profit
forecast, signaling the durability of a global recovery powered
by growth outside the U.S.  
 UBS Profit  
 HSBC climbed 1.7 percent to HK$78.85, while Standard
Chartered Plc, a British bank that makes most of its profit in
Asia, jumped 3 percent to HK$224.60.  
 Both stocks  rallied  in the afternoon session after UBS
reported net income of 2.01 billion Swiss francs ($1.91 billion).
That beat the 1.12 billion-franc median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 China State Construction, which provides civil engineering
services, rallied 5.7 percent to HK$3.32, the highest since Jan.
6. Citigroup rated the stock “buy” in new coverage.  
 Wharf  dropped 1.4 percent to HK$42.85. Sino Land Co., a
residential developer and owner of commercial buildings, slid
1.5 percent to HK$14.78, the sharpest decline on the Hang Seng
Index. The Hang Seng Property Index retreated 0.3 percent.  
 ‘People Are Worried’  
 Hong Kong’s government may sell a building site in the up-
market Peak district for HK$10.5 billion ($1.35 billion) in an
auction tomorrow. The estimate for the Mt. Nicholson Road site
is the median of seven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “The market initially held a very high level of
expectation after the last land auction, a record high, so this
time people are worried that the auction results will miss
market expectations,” said  Sylvia Wong , an analyst at UOB-Kay
Hian Ltd.  
 Zijin Mining Group Co. , the Chinese gold producer blamed
for the industry’s worst spill in two years, extended a trading
halt pending a price-sensitive announcement, saying an
“important matter” is “still in process.” It last traded at
HK$4.99 on July 23.  
 Futures on the Hang Seng Index climbed 0.6 percent to
20,964. Twenty-five stocks rose while 15 fell on the 43-member
gauge.

                          July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., talks with Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin about his investment strategy for Chinese banks. 
     Chinese banks may struggle to recoup about 23 percent of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) they’ve lent to finance local government infrastructure projects, according to a person with knowledge of data collected by the nation’s regulator. About half of all loans need to be serviced by secondary sources including guarantors because the ventures can’t generate sufficient revenue, the person said, declining to be identified because the information is confidential.
