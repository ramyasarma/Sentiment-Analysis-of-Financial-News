             Australia’s ruling Labor party will
remove a media rule stopping free-to-air television companies
from owning stations that reach more than 75 percent of the
population if it’s re-elected, the Australian Financial Review
reported, citing Communications Minister Stephen Conroy. The
review of media laws, expected in 2011, might lead to Ten
Network Holdings Ltd. bidding for its regional affiliate
Southern Cross Media Group Ltd., and Seven  Group Holdings Ltd.
seeking to take over Prime Media Group Ltd., according to the
report.
