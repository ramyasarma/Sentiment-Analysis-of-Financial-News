             China said the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations has become its fourth-largest trading
partner, buoyed by a free trade accord that took effect Jan. 1.  
 Trade surged 55 percent in the first six months of the year
to $136.5 billion, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.
Chinese exports to the 10-member group climbed 45 percent to
$64.6 billion and imports rose 64 percent from a year earlier to
$71.9 billion.  
 “The China-Asean Free Trade Area has brought real benefits
to companies and people from both sides,” Vice Commerce
Minister  Gao Hucheng  said in a  statement  posted on the
government’s web site yesterday. “Asean has become China’s
fourth-largest trade partner.”  
 The free-trade agreement scrapped tariffs on about 90
percent of goods between China and  Asean , whose members are led
by Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.  
 Direct investments by China in Asean nations amounted to
$1.2 billion in the first half while the group’s members
invested $3.1 billion in China during the same period, Gao said
without giving comparative figures.  
 “The government will actively support companies that are
able and willing to go out and invest in Asean nations,” with a
focus on infrastructure, Gao said.  
 The 7th  China-Asean Expo  will be held in China’s southern
Nanning from Oct. 20 to 24, to showcase low and zero-tariff
products, as well as providing data base and trade-matching
systems to facilitate trade and investment, Gao said.
