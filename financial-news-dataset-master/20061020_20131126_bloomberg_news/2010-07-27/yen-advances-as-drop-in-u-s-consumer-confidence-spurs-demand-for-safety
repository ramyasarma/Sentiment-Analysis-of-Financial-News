             The yen strengthened against higher-
yielding currencies on speculation signs of slowing growth in
the U.S. will spur demand for safer assets.  
 Japan’s currency gained before U.S. reports in two days
forecast to show economic and business activity rose at a slower
pace. Australia’s dollar slid after the nation’s consumer prices
increased less than expected, backing the case for the central
bank to keep interest rates unchanged. South Korea’s won fell
for the first time in seven days as traders said the Bank of
Korea intervened.  
 “I doubt the U.S. economic recovery will be self-
sustainable and policy makers seem to have few options left to
support the economy,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, senior strategist at
Mizuho Trust & Banking Co. in Tokyo. “The yen will see upward
pressure.”  
 The yen strengthened to 78.71 per Australian dollar as of
6:45 a.m. in London from 79.33 in New York yesterday. The
Japanese currency was at 114.32 yen per euro from 114.24
yesterday, when it reached 114.42, the weakest level since May
18. The yen traded at 87.84 per dollar from 87.90. The greenback
fetched $1.3013 per euro from $1.2996.  
 Japan’s currency pared gains against the euro as the  Nikkei
225 Stock Average  rose 2.7 percent and the  MSCI Asia Pacific
Index  of regional shares advanced 1.1 percent.  
 The U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in
the second quarter after expanding at a 2.7 percent pace in the
first, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before the data is released on July 30.  
 The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. is
forecast to report its business barometer fell to 56.0 in July
from 59.1 in June, a separate Bloomberg survey showed ahead of
the July 30 announcement. Figures more than 50 signal expansion.  
 Annual Performance  
 Japan’s currency has advanced 9.5 percent this year in the
biggest gain among developed-world counterparts, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices. The euro has
dropped 7.6 percent, while the dollar is up 2.8 percent.  
 The yen typically strengthens in times of financial turmoil
as Japan’s trade surplus means it does not have to rely on
overseas lenders.  
 “I don’t think the dollar-yen will fall much from here as
a downtrend of U.S. yields is easing,” said  Daisaku Ueno ,
president at Gaitame.Com Research Institute Ltd., a unit of
Japan’s largest currency margin company.  
 Treasury two-year note  yields  were at 0.649 percent after
rising as much as six basis points yesterday, the biggest
intraday climb since June 10. They touched a record low 0.5516
percent on July 23.  
 Economy Risks  
 Bank of Japan board member Hidetoshi Kamezaki highlighted
economic risks of a rising yen and said the bank will act
proactively to combat deflation, a more aggressive stance than
his colleagues have indicated.  
 “We need to recognize the impact of the weaker euro and
stronger yen on the competitiveness of exporters and the impact
of instability of financial markets on companies’ fund-raising
activities as downside risks to the economy,” Kamezaki said
today in a speech in Sapporo, northern Japan.  
 The Australian dollar dropped against all of its 16 major
counterparts after the Bureau of Statistics said consumer prices
rose 0.6 percent in the second quarter from the previous three
months. The median estimate of 21 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for a gain of 1 percent.  
 “There’s very little pressure now on the Reserve Bank of
Australia to raise next week though rate rises are still
possible later in the year,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency
strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “The
Aussie-kiwi will move a bit lower as the RBNZ should be raising
more than the RBA, closing that interest-rate gap.”  
 Won Intervention  
 The Reserve Bank of Australia is forecast to keep the
benchmark interest rate at 4.5 percent on Aug. 3, the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey showed. The
nation’s policy makers signaled last week they are watching
 inflation  as they consider whether to resume rate increases
after leaving borrowing costs unchanged in June and July.  
 Australia’s dollar dropped 0.8 percent to 89.53 U.S. cents.  
 South Korea’s won retreated from near a one-month high
versus the dollar after the Bank of Korea bought about $150
million in the first hour of local trading today after reporting
the biggest current account surplus in a year, according to two
traders who asked not to be identified.  
 The government last month announced a tightening of limits
on currency derivatives to curb capital flows and Vice Finance
Minister Yim Jong Yong said policy makers would use “smoothing-
operation” measures to stabilize the won.  
 “The pace of the won’s movement will be controlled,” said
 Sung Jae Man , a currency dealer at Tong Yang Securities Co Ltd.
in Seoul. “Disappointing U.S. consumer data and the possibility
of intervention will keep the won in the 1,180s against the
dollar today.”  
 The nation’s  current-account surplus  widened to $5.04
billion in June, from a revised $3.82 billion the previous
month, the Bank of Korea reported today.  
 The won fell to 1,186.45 per dollar from 1,181.43
yesterday, when it rose to 1,181.33, the highest levelWGTXPK4182BQ&peplid=16207764&pepllastname=Zachariahs&peplfirstname=Candice&peplcompanyname=Bloomberg_News&peplcompanynumber=604088&pepltitle=No_Title_Info&interviewstatus=0&interviewdate=2010-07-28_08_30_20&interviewreporterpepl=0&intervieweditorpepl=2132575&interviewsource=News_Reporter_Software&srange=7318&erange=7336">Candice Zachariahs and  Jacob Greber  in
