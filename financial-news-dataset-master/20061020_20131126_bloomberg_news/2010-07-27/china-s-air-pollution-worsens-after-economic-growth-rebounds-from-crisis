             China’s air quality deteriorated for
the first time in five years in January-to-June of 2010 as
economic growth accelerated to 11.1 percent.  
 Pollution of coastal waters also worsened from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said on its
website yesterday. Acid rain was detected in 189 of 443 cities
monitored, a level similar to last year, it said.  
 China estimates its carbon-dioxide emissions will continue
to rise in the next two decades, peaking in 2030, as it burns
more coal and oil to power the world’s fastest-growing major
economy. A 4 trillion yuan ($590 billion) stimulus package has
helped fuel double-digit  economic expansion  in the past three
quarters after the global financial crisis dragged growth to the
slowest in almost a decade in the first quarter of 2009.  
 In the first half, air quality was “fair” or better on 91
percent of days in 113 Chinese cities that were monitored, the
ministry said. That was 0.3 percentage points lower than a year
earlier, the first decline since 2005, according to the report.
The amount of inhalable particles was 0.091 milligrams per cubic
meter in the cities, rising by 0.002 milligrams from a year
earlier, according to the report.  
 In  Shanghai , 94.5 percent of days were “fair” or better,
an increase of 2.2 percentage points from a year earlier,
according to the ministry. In the southern city of Guangzhou,
the level was was 95.6 percent, an increase of 1.1 percentage
points, according to the report.  
 The ministry also found that 26.4 percent of China’s
surface water was not fit for drinking due to pollution. That’s
an increase from the 24.2 percent of water classified in the
first half of 2009 as being fit only for industrial use and farm
irrigation, according to the ministry.
