             India’s rupee rose the most in more
than two weeks on speculation the central bank will increase
interest rates for the fourth time this year, boosting yields on
local assets.  
 The currency gained for the fourth time in five days as all
20 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed that the  Reserve
Bank of India  will probably raise its  reverse repurchase rate  by
a quarter-point to 4.25 percent at a meeting today. The rupee
also advanced after Moody’s Investors Service upgraded India’s
local-currency debt rating to Ba1 yesterday, the highest non-
investment category. That was the first increase since 1998.  
 “The rupee is stronger ahead of the anticipated interest-
rate increase,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general manager at
Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Rising rates may help reinforce
the positive sentiment on India among overseas investors.”  
 The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 46.845 per dollar
as of 9:44 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That pared the currency’s losses this month to 0.8
percent, still the worst performance among Asian currencies.  
 Offshore forward contracts indicated the rupee will trade
at 47.38 to the dollar in three months, compared with
expectations for a rate of 47.60 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  
 Overseas holdings of the nation’s stocks and bonds touched
all-time highs of  $81.8 billion  and  $15.4 billion , respectively,
this month, according to data from the Securities and Exchange
Board of India.
