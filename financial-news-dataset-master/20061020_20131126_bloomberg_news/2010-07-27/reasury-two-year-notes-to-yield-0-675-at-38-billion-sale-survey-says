             The Treasury Department’s $38
billion sale of two-year notes will draw a yield of 0.675
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 18 primary dealers.  
 The amount of the offering is the smallest since December
2008. The securities, which mature in July 2012, yielded 0.672
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  
 Last month’s $40 billion sale of two-year notes drew a
 yield  of 0.738 percent, the lowest on record, compared with
0.769 percent in the May sale.  
 The June 22 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.45, the highest since October 2009, compared with an average
of 3.18 for the past 10 sales.  
 Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 41.4 percent of the notes at the
June offering. The average for the past 10 sales was 40.9
percent.  
 Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 21.3 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with 15.2 percent in May
and an average of 15.3 percent at the past 10 auctions.  
 The Fed’s primary dealers trade government securities with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  
 Two-year notes have returned 1.92 percent this year,
compared with 5.98 percent for the overall Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  
 The Treasury is selling $104 billion in notes this week.
It’s scheduled to auction $37 billion of five-year securities
tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year debt on July 29. The
total, down from $108 billion last month, is the lowest monthly
offering of the three securities since June 2009.
