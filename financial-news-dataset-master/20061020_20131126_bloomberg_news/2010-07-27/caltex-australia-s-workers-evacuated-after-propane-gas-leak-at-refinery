             Caltex Australia Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest oil refiner, said its Kurnell plant in southern Sydney
operated normally as a propane leak from a gas pipeline prompted
the removal of some workers.  
 Emergency services are at the site and the propane pipeline
is being depressurized after the “small leak,”  Felicity Wilson ,
a Sydney-based spokeswoman for Caltex Australia, said by
telephone. The leak was discovered around 9 a.m. today. The oil
and lubricating refineries at the site haven’t been shut down,
she said.  
 Kurnell, the biggest of Caltex Australia’s two refineries,
has the capacity to process about 135,000 barrels of crude a day.  
 The refinery is one of seven in the country, with others
operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc.
Caltex Australia, half-owned by Chevron Corp., also operates the
Lytton plant in Queensland state.
