             Spanish 10-year government bonds
surged for a second day, reducing the extra yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of German bunds.  
 The yield on the 10-year Spanish security fell 10 basis
points to 4.16 percent as of 11:28 a.m. in London. That narrowed
the  yield spread  with bunds by 11 basis points to 137 basis
points, the least since May 19.  
 The Portuguese 10-year yield fell 15 basis points to 5.39
percent and the Italian yield dropped five basis points to 3.95
percent.
