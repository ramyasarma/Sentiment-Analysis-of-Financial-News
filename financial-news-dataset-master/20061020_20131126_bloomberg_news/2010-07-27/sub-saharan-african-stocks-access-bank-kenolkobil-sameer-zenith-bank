 Access Bank Plc (ACCESS NL), a Nigerian lender, rose 43
kobo, or 4.8 percent, to 9.35 naira, the highest in more than
two months. Access Bank forecast profit of 2.32 billion naira
($15.4 million) in the nine months through September, it said in

didn’t provide comparative figures.  
 KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC KN), a Kenyan fuel retailer, fell the
most this month, declining 30 cents, or 3 percent, to close at
9.85 shillings. The stock dropped on concern KenolKobil’s plan
to invest in Zimbabwe would be hindered by a law that requires
companies to be 51 percent owned by black Zimbabweans, George
Bodo, a research and investment analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis
Capital Ltd., said in an interview today.  
 Sameer Africa Ltd. (SAME KN), a Kenyan tiremaker, gained 10
cents, or 1.2 percent, to 8.5 shillings, the highest since July
19. Net income advanced to 58.96 million shillings ($728,620)
from 48.67 million shillings a year earlier, the company said in
a statement published in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation
yesterday.  
 Sterling Bank (STERLNBA NL), a Nigerian lender, advanced 10
kobo, or 4.7 percent, to 2.24 naira, the highest since May 18.
The company returned to profit in the first half through June,
reporting net income of 3.94 billion naira compared to a loss of
7 billion naira a year earlier, it said in a statement e-mailed
by the Nigerian Stock Exchange today.  
 Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA NL), Nigeria’s second-biggest
lender by market value, rallied 45 kobo, or 3.3 percent, to
13.95 naira, a one-month high. United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA
NL) increased 33 kobo, or 3.1 percent, to 10.85 naira, the
highest in a month. Nigerian banks rose after ThisDay reported
that the World Bank’s International Finance Corp. said it would
invest $200 million in Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and $100 million
in First Bank Plc. The funding is the first phase of a program
that will eventually include nine banks, including Zenith and
United Bank for Africa.
