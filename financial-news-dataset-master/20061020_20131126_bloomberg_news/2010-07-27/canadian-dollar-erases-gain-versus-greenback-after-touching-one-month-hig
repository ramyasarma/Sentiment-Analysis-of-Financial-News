             The Canadian currency erased its
gain versus the greenback and traded little changed after a
report showed U.S. consumer confidence trailed economists’
forecasts.  
 Canada’s dollar earlier touched the highest level in more
than a month as rising equities and stronger prices for
commodities boosted the appeal of currencies tied to growth.
Crude oil dropped 0.7 percent to $78.41 a barrel.  
 The Canadian currency traded at C$1.0356 per U.S. dollar at
10:51 a.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.0323 yesterday. It
earlier touched C$1.0256, the highest level since June 22. One
Canadian dollar buys 96.56 U.S. cents.
