             China must boost the purchasing
power of its people to increase domestic consumption, Cheng
Siwei, former vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People’s Congress, wrote in a commentary in the China
Daily.  
 Letting the Chinese currency appreciate would fail to
accomplish this goal as this would increase only international
purchasing power and consumer goods account for less than 20
percent of imports, Cheng wrote in the commentary.
