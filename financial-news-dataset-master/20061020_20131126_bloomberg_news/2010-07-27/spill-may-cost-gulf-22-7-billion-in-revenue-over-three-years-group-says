             BP Plc’s oil spill may cost Gulf
coastal communities $22.7 billion in lost revenue over the next
three years, more than the amount the company has agreed to set
aside to pay claims, the head of a tourism association said.  
 Roger Dow , president and chief executive officer of the
U.S. Travel Association in Washington, gave the estimate in
written testimony for a hearing today by the House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection
on the impact of the spill on tourism. The figure comes from
Oxford Economics, a U.K. consulting firm, and was based on 25
previous disasters, including oil spills, hurricanes and
terrorist attacks.  
 The estimated cost exceeds the $20 billion  BP  has agreed to
put into an escrow account to pay spill victims. Tourism
generates $94 billion in revenues for Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Florida,  Dow said .  
 “This large and vital sector of the Gulf Coast economy is
in jeopardy,” Dow said.  
 The travel group wants BP to set up a $500 million account
for a marketing campaign, Dow said. The effort could generate
$7.5 billion in tourism, he said.  
 BP has said that it will pay all “legitimate” claims, and
that it will add money to the escrow fund as needed.  
 Dow said the $500 million account should be directed by
 Kenneth Feinberg , the Washington attorney tapped by BP and the
Obama administration to run an independent claims facility to
handle private claims.  
 ‘Shying Away’  
 Feinberg doesn’t have authority to reimburse local
governments, which can seek compensation for lost revenue and
cleanup costs from BP.  
 Subcommittee Chairman  Bobby Rush , an Illinois Democrat,
said various studies estimate that the oil spill has put 300,000
jobs at risk, or 15 percent of the total in the region.  
 “Now that BP has created a $20 billion claims pool to
compensate victims who’ve been impacted by the oil spill, the
purpose of this hearing is to make sure that the travel and
tourism industry will not be left behind,” Rush said.  
 “Tourists are shying away from the areas of the Gulf even
where no oil has come ashore,” Energy and Commerce Committee
Chairman  Henry Waxman , a California Democrat, said at the
hearing.  
 Florida’s beaches remain largely oil-free, said Democratic
Representative  Kathy Castor , whose district includes Tampa.  
 The state suffers more from a perception of a problem, she
suggested. The “word has gone out” that “Florida beaches are
damaged,” Castor said.  
 “The efforts by BP to date have been inadequate, to say
the least,” Castor said.  
 Keith Overton, chief operating office for TradeWinds Island
Resorts in St. Petersburg, Florida, testified that call volume
from potential visitors was down by 25 percent since before the
spill.
