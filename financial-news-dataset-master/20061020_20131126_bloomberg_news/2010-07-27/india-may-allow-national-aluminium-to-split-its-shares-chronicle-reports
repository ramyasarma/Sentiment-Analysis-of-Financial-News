             India’s government may allow
National Aluminium Co. to issue free shares and split the stock
to boost liquidity, the Financial Chronicle reported, citing a
mines ministry official it didn’t identify. The state-owned
metals producer prefers a stock split to selling a stake in the
company, the newspaper said.
