             Islamic Bank of Britain  Plc said it
will raise 20 million pounds ($31 million) through a proposed
placing of ordinary shares at a discounted price of 1 pence each
to be subscribed by Qatar International Islamic Bank.  
 The funds “will be used to provide the company with
sufficient regulatory capital to manage and grow its business,”
according to a statement from the Birmingham-based, U.K. bank.
IBB aims to turn to profit by growing “secured financing,
through its home purchase plan.”  
 IBB reported a loss of 9.5 million pounds last year,
compared with 5.9 million pounds in 2008, because of the impact
of the U.K.’s recession on the housing market, unemployment,
disposable incomes and as market yields adversely affected the
bank’s revenue, the statement said.  
 The lender has provided mortgages, loans and retail
services through its eight branches since 2004 to cater to the
U.K.’s 1.8 million Muslims.  
 The U.K. Islamic mortgage market amounts to 500 million
pounds, 0.3 percent of total home loans,  International Financial
Services London , which promotes the nation’s financial industry
overseas, said in a  January  report. To comply with the
religion’s ban on interest, Shariah-qualified banks buy property
on behalf of the borrower and resell it back at a profit, with
repayments typically made in installments.  
 IBB’s  shares  were unchanged at 3.25 pounds yesterday, down
55 percent from the year’s peak of 7.25 pounds on Jan. 21,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
