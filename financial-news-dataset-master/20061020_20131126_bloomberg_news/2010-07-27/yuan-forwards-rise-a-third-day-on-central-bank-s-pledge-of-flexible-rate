             Yuan forwards strengthened for a
third day after China’s central bank said a flexible exchange
rate will help improve the effectiveness of its monetary policy.  
 A more flexible yuan can help contain inflation and prevent
asset bubbles, central bank Deputy Governor  Hu Xiaolian  said
yesterday. “Moderate” yuan moves may also assist in addressing
trade and international payment imbalances, as well as promote
steady and sustainable economic growth, she said. Bonds fell on
speculation investors were switching to stocks.  
 “The central bank used a series of statements on yuan
policy to show the world its determination to have a more
flexible exchange rate,” said  Zhao Qingming , a financial
analyst in Beijing at China Construction Bank Corp., the
nation’s second-largest lender by market value. “The yuan’s
rate will be more closely affected by the Dollar Index and the
euro as it’s managed with reference to a basket currency.”  
 Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards rose 0.07
percent to 6.6855 per dollar as of 5:41 p.m. in Hong Kong,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the currency will advance 1.4 percent from the spot rate,
which was little changed at 6.7786.  
 The yuan is allowed to trade 0.5 percent on either side of
the daily  reference rate , which was set at 6.7742, the strongest
level since July 16. The Dollar Index slid to a three-month low
and the euro traded near a two-month high versus the greenback.  
 The yuan has strengthened 0.7 percent since China on June
19 scrapped a two-year-old peg to the dollar. A “fixed”
exchange rate caused excess capital to flow into China’s
financial system and “severely challenged” the independence
and effectiveness of monetary policy, the central bank’s Hu said.  
 Bonds Fall  
 Government bonds fell for a second day on speculation a
six-day rally in China stocks drew funds away from the debt
market.  
 The Shanghai  Composite Index , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, advanced 6.8 percent over the last six
days, the longest winning streak since November, before receding
0.5 percent today.  
 The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures funding
availability between banks, gained two basis points to 1.75
percent, according to the National Interbank Funding Center. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 “Stock-market gains in the past few days have been more
attractive to investors while there’s no news to move the debt
market,” said  Zhang Yige , a Shanghai-based bond trader at
Industrial Bank Co.  
 The yield on the 3.62 percent note due in November 2023
climbed six basis points to 3.63 percent, and the price of the
security dropped 0.67 per 100 yuan face amount to 99.90,
according to the China Interbank Bond Market data.  
 The central bank sold 23 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) of
one-year bills today at a yield of 2.0929 percent, unchanged for
a seventh week.
