             Japan may delay the release of an
annual defense report planned for this week to avoid provoking
South Korea ahead of the Aug. 29 centenary of Japan’s annexation
of the Korean Peninsula, Kyodo News said, citing unidentified
sources.  
 The defense policy report describes two South Korean-
controlled islets and a number of reefs as an integral part of
Japanese territory, Kyodo said.  
 Japan has declined a South Korean request to delete the
description from the report, which will likely now be released
in September, Kyodo said.
