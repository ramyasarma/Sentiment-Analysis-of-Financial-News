             Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. , the east European broadcaster that sold a stake to Time
Warner Inc., may say second-quarter profit jumped after it
disposed of unprofitable assets in Ukraine and purchased a
television station in Bulgaria.  
 Net income for the three months ended June 30 probably rose
to $219.2 million from $24.1 million a year earlier, according
to the median estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Revenue probably rose 4.5 percent to $194.6 million.  
 “Results will be positively impacted by asset disposal in
Ukraine and an acquisition in Bulgaria,” Atlantik Financni Trhy
AS’ analyst  Patrick Vyroubal  said by phone today. “TV ad market
development is still not ideal but close to the bottom; also a
strengthening of the dollar may result in cuts for the full-year
forecast.” Vyroubal has a recommendation of “hold”  on the
shares.  
 The broadcaster, also known as CME, said in June spending
on television advertising in its markets continued to fall in
the second quarter. The Hamilton, Bermuda-based broadcaster,
agreed to sell Ukrainian units for $300 million in January. CME
also completed the acquisition of Bulgarian channel bTV from
News Corp. in April.  
 CME operates TV channels in Czech Republic, Romania,
Croatia, Slovenia, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Results for the second
quarter are expected to be released by July 28.
