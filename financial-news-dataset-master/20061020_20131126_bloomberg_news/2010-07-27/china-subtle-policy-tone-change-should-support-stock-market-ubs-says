             China’s government has signaled a
“subtle shift” in its policies that will provide support to
the stock market, UBS AG said.  
 “No additional tightening measures will be forthcoming,”
UBS economist Tao Wang wrote in a note to clients.  
          
          


  
     
       
     
           
                           
                 
                 
                                       
                                   
               
                        
           
                          July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., talks with Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin about his investment strategy for Chinese banks. 
     Chinese banks may struggle to recoup about 23 percent of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) they’ve lent to finance local government infrastructure projects, according to a person with knowledge of data collected by the nation’s regulator. About half of all loans need to be serviced by secondary sources including guarantors because the ventures can’t generate sufficient revenue, the person said, declining to be identified because the information is confidential.
