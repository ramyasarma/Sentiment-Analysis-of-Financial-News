 Australia:  
 Gold producers: Gold fell for the second straight session
in New York yesterday as the euro climbed against the dollar,
eroding demand for the metal as a haven amid waning European-
debt concerns.

producer, lost 0.9 percent to A$33.06. Rival St. Barbara Ltd.
(SBM AU) slumped 7.4 percent to 31.5 Australian cents.  
      Insurance Australia Group Ltd.  (IAG AU), the Sydney-based
insurer formed in 1925, dropped 4.3 percent to A$3.35 after
saying fiscal-year profit halved after rising claims at its U.K.
unit.  
      James Hardie Industries SE  (JHX AU), the biggest seller of
home siding in the U.S., rose 2.9 percent to A$6.73. Sales of
U.S. new homes in June rose more than forecast, following an
unprecedented collapse the prior month.  
      Wesfarmers Ltd.  (WES AU), Australia’s second-largest
retailer, climbed 0.9 percent to A$30.36 after having its stock
rating raised to “neutral” from “underperform” by analysts

publicly traded power company, fell 1.6 percent to NZ$5.60. The
company said June power prices fell 34 percent from a year
