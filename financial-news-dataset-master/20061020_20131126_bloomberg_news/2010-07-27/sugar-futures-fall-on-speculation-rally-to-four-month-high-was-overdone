             Raw sugar declined on bets that a
rally to a four-month high was overdone.  
 Earlier, the commodity reached 19.05 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since March 19 on signs of
increasing demand from Asian nations including the Philippines
and Pakistan. The price climbed 6.7 percent last week  
 “There’s some profit taking,” said  Bruno Lima , a risk-
management consultant at FCStone Group in Campinas, Brazil.
“Fundamentally, nothing has changed in the market.”  
 Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.2 cent, or 1.1
percent, to 18.42 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price gained as much as 2.3 percent. The commodity
has risen 15 percent this month.  
 The Philippines may auction rights to import 100,000 metric
tons of sugar by Aug. 2, a government official said. In
Pakistan, traders will be allowed to import 500,000 tons until
Nov. 30 without paying duties, the government said in a
statement.  
 Futures more than doubled last year after excess rain in
Brazil, the world’s top producer, and a weak monsoon in India,
the second-biggest, crimped output. Prices gave dropped 32
percent this year on forecasts for bigger global crops.  
 Refined-sugar futures for October delivery rose 50 cents,
or 0.1 percent, to $566.60 a ton on the Liffe exchange in
London.
