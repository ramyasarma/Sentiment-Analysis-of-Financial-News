             The billionaire Barclay brothers
sold their 10 percent stake in the U.K.’s  InterContinental
Hotels Group Plc  for about 335 million pounds ($520 million)
after the hotelier’s shares soared 88 percent in a year.  
 InterContinental tumbled 7.4 percent in London trading
after Barclays Capital sold almost 30 million shares on behalf
of Ellerman Corp., a company controlled by David and  Frederick Barclay , for 1,120 pence apiece, according to three people
familiar with the transaction.  
 Ellerman, the biggest shareholder in Windsor, England-based
InterContinental, sold its entire stake following a 34 percent
surge in the share price since the start of 2010. The Barclays
built their stake in InterContinental in 2007, fuelling
speculation that the brothers may make a bid for the hotelier.  
 Leslie McGibbon , a spokesman for InterContinental Hotels,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.
Calls to Ellerman were not returned.  
 InterContinental  slumped  89 pence to 1,110 pence at the
close of trading in London, the steepest percentage drop since
June 4, 2007. That valued the company at 3.2 billion pounds.  
 InterContinental confirmed in a statement that Ellerman no
longer has a holding in the hotelier.
