             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
said second-quarter profit rose 32 percent on increased sales of
generic drugs in the U.S. and of Copaxone, the multiple
sclerosis treatment that may face generic competition from
 Novartis AG  and  Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc.   
 Earnings climbed to $981 million, or $1.08 a share, from
$742 million, or 83 cents, the Petah Tikva, Israel-based company
said in a statement today. That excludes costs linked to
acquisitions such as the purchase of Germany’s Ratiopharm GmbH.
Profit beat the average  estimate  of $1.04 a share from 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 About 20 percent of Teva’s $3.8 billion in sales came from
Copaxone, a proprietary drug discovered by researchers at the
Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Investors are concerned
about competition from Novartis and Momenta after U.S.
regulators on July 23 approved their copy of another complex
medicine,  Sanofi-Aventis SA ’s Lovenox.  
 “It’s a very good quarter,” said  David Levinson , a Tel
Aviv-based analyst for Bank Hapoalim, in a telephone interview.
“Though what will happen to Copaxone is more important than
today’s report.” Levinson has an “outperform” rating on the
stock.  
 Profit this year will be $4.50 to $4.60 a share, up from a
previous forecast of $4.40 to $4.60, Chief Executive Officer
 Shlomo Yanai  told analysts on a conference call. Teva shares
rose 0.6 percent to 196.50 shekels at 4 p.m. in Tel Aviv
trading.  
 ‘Important Step’  
 The Food and Drug Administration’s approval of a generic
Lovenox “is an important step” in the regulator’s thinking,
said  Ronny Gal , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “It
bodes well for biosimilar developers” and makes approval of
generic Copaxone more likely, Gal, who rates Teva shares
“market perform,” wrote in a note to investors yesterday.  
 Teva, the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, has said
it expects Copaxone to face additional competition from new oral
MS treatments from Novartis and Germany’s  Merck KGaA  by the end
of the year. The company expects to lose about $1 billion in
Copaxone revenue to competitors by 2015, Yanai said in January.  
 Copaxone sales climbed 13 percent to $773 million, while
revenue in North America increased 17 percent to $2.47 billion.  
 Sales in Europe, where Teva agreed in March to  buy 
Ratiopharm for 3.63 billion euros ($4.72 billion) to reduce its
dependence on Copaxone and the U.S., rose 4 percent to $811
million. A decline in the value of the euro, pound and forint
relative to the dollar hurt revenue in Europe, Teva said.
