             North Dakota’s southeast region may
produce more hard-red spring wheat per acre this year than in
2009, based on preliminary field surveys in the annual Wheat
Quality Council tour of farms in the state.  
 Yields may average 43.9 bushels an acre in the area, based
on random samples collected from 10 fields on the first day of
the tour. In 2009, the estimated yield in the southeast route
was 39.7 bushels. Some fields in the region couldn’t be scouted
today because excessive rain left soil too muddy to be scouted.
North Dakota is the biggest U.S. wheat-producing state.  
 “It’s a promising crop,” even though there was more wind
and hail damage than in recent years, said  Jim Peterson , the
marketing director at the Mandan-based North Dakota Wheat
Commission and a tour participant. “It is on par with last
year’s crop.”  
 Wheat futures for December delivery rose 4.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.4225 a bushel as of 1:10 p.m. on the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange, where spring wheat is traded. The price has
gained 25 percent this month as excessive rain in Canada curbed
planting and drought hurt grain crops in Russia.  
 Last year, participants in the North Dakota tour scouted
184 fields on the first day and forecast the yield at 45.9
bushels an acre, council data show.  
 North Dakota will produce 281.7 million bushels of  spring
wheat , down 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said on July 9. Yields are expected to be 43
bushels an acre, down from 46 bushels last year.
