             The koruna will probably strengthen
to near the highest level in 2009 against the euro as the Czech
economy recovers and concerns ease that banks need more capital,
boosting demand for riskier assets, Komercni Banka AS said.  
 The currency is poised to gain to around 25 versus the euro
by the end of the week and “test the support area” of its 2009
and 2010 peaks, Komercni economist  Jan Vejmelek  in Prague wrote
in an e-mail. The koruna climbed to 25.015 on April 15, the
strongest intraday level since Sept. 17, 2009, of 24.983,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The koruna may
appreciate to around 24.5 in the next 12 months, according to
Vejmelek wrote.  
 Czech business and consumer confidence jumped to a 22-month
high in July on rising demand for the country’s exports, a
government agency reported yesterday. Regulators said last week
that most European banks passed tests assessing their capital
strength.  
 “Supporting the koruna are both technical factors and a
positive sentiment among foreign investors,” Vejmelek wrote.
“Czech fundamentals remain favorable” and “stress tests in
the European banking system did not produce any negative
surprises,” he said.  
 Premier  Petr Necas ’s government has promised to cut its
deficit to within the European Union limit of 3 percent of
economic output by 2013 from the 2010 target of 5.3 percent.
Meeting the goals could put “upward pressure” on the country’s
A1 rating, Moody’s Investors Service analyst  Dietmar Hornung 
said in an interview with Bloomberg News published on July 19.
Necas took office this month after parties pledging to reduce
the deficit won elections in May.  
 “The election result and a strong center-right government
create a favorable environment for the adoption of structural
reforms that would stop further growth of the country’s debt,”
Vejmelek wrote.
