             New York Giants third-round draft
pick Chad Jones is being released from a New York hospital today
after a one-month stay following a serious car accident.  
 Jones, who has undergone several operations on his left leg
and ankle since the June 25 accident, will return to his home in
New Orleans for several weeks before coming back to New York for
further surgery, the National Football League team said in a
news release.  
 “Chad is in great spirits and excited to be getting out of
the hospital,”  Ronnie Barnes , the Giants’ vice president of
medical services, said in a statement. “All has gone well thus
far for Chad, and he will return in probably six to eight weeks
for another surgical procedure.”  
 Jones, a 21-year-old safety out of Louisiana State
University, fractured the leg and ankle in the single-car crash
in New Orleans. He underwent eight hours of surgery to improve
blood flow in his foot, and on June 29 was moved to a Manhattan
hospital for plastic surgery and additional procedures.  
 New Orleans police said they had no reason to believe
alcohol played a factor in the crash.
