             Natural gas futures rose for a
second day as hotter-than-normal weather boosted demand for gas-
fired electricity for air conditioning.  
 Temperatures will be above normal across much of the U.S.
Midwest and East from Aug. 1 to Aug. 5, according to  the
National Weather Service . The Energy Department on July 29 may
report that U.S. gas stockpiles rose 32 billion cubic feet last
week, according to the median of five analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. The five-year average gain is 50 billion.  
 “It’s pretty hot and the AC is running,” said  Kyle Cooper , managing director at energy consultant IAF Advisors in
Houston. “The next injection number is going to be pretty
bullish.”  
 Natural gas for August delivery rose 6.3 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $4.675 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas has gained 30 percent
from a year ago. The August contract expires tomorrow. The
September gas futures contract gained 6.3 cents to $4.646.  
 “The last days of a contract could be dictated more by
financial considerations of those who have to get out as opposed
to any real supply-demand fundamentals,” Cooper said.  
 August may see more heat in the Midwest than in the
Northeast, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland.  
 Weather Outlook  
 Chicago will have a high of 89 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius) on Aug. 3, 5 degrees above average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. New York will
have a high of 83.  
 About 23 percent of electricity is generated using natural
gas, according to the Energy Department.  
 “For the past couple of weeks the price was more weather-
dominated,” said  Tom Orr , director of research at Weeden & Co.,
a brokerage in Greenwich, Connecticut. “And now I think the
focus is on the recovering strength of the economy.”  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of  property values  in 20 U.S.
cities increased 4.6 percent in May from a year earlier, the
biggest year-over-year gain since August 2006, the group said
today in New York.  
 “We’ve been seeing a little bit of hopefulness in the
housing numbers,” said  Peter Beutel , president of trading
adviser Cameron Hanover Inc. in New Canaan, Connecticut. “At
this point, most traders are keeping a small eye on the economy
and saving up their major reactions for the coming EIA
underground storage report.”  
 Gas supplies rose 51 billion cubic feet in the week ended
July 16, the Energy Department’s Energy Information
Administration reported last week.  
 Supply Report  
 The stockpile total of 2.891 trillion cubic feet was 9.9
percent higher than the five-year average, narrower than a 10.7
percent gap the previous week. The deficit to year-earlier
supplies widened to 1.8 percent from 1.1 percent.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, rose 6.8 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $4.7184 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
178,233 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with a three-month average
total of 250,000. Volume was 191,592 yesterday. Open interest
was 773,946 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
824,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.
