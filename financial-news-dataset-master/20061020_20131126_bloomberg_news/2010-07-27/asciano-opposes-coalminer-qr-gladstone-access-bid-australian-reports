             Asciano Group is opposing a bid by
16 Queensland coalminers to join with a unit of its competitor
QR National to use railway infrastructure associated with the
proposed Wiggins Island coal export terminal at Gladstone, the
Australian newspaper reported. The bid, which comes as a group
of coal companies seeks to buy QR National’s rail network, may
create competition issues, as some of the miners are members of
the takeover group, the newspaper said, citing Asciano Access
and Regulation Manager Stuart Ronan.
