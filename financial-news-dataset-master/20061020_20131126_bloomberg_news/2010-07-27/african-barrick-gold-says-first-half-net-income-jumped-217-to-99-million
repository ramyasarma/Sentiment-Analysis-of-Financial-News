             African Barrick Gold Plc , the
biggest gold producer listed in London, said second-quarter
profit more than doubled as output and prices of the metal
increased. The company cut its full-year production target.  
 Net income rose to $46.2 million in the three months
through June 30 from $19.7 million a year earlier, the London-
based company said in a statement today. The company lowered its
full-year output target to 750,000 to 800,000 ounces from its
previous range of 800,000 to 850,000 ounces following delays at
its Buzwagi mine in Tanzania.  
 African Barrick’s gold output rose 9.7 percent to 179,113
ounces in the quarter. Gold for immediate delivery averaged
$1,196.52 in the period compared with $922.13 in 2009.  
 African Barrick, spun off by the world’s largest gold
producer Barrick Gold Corp. in March, is forecasting annual
production of more than 1 million ounces by 2014. The company
operates four mines in Tanzania.  
 Revenue climbed 53 percent to $213.2 million.
