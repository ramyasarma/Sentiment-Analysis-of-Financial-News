             South African stocks fell, reversing
an earlier gain, after a technical glitch that halted trading on
Africa’s largest bourse for almost six hours, the longest delay
in more than two years.  
 Trading was halted at about 9:26 a.m. and resumed at about
3:20 p.m. in Johannesburg. The exchange closed an hour later
than usual, JSE Ltd., the operator of the bourse, said in an e-
mailed statement. The  FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index  fell 0.1
percent to 28,461.48 at the 6 p.m. close, after climbing as much
as 0.9 percent once dealing had restarted.  
 “For us it doesn’t only result in a potential loss of
revenue but also the loss of trading opportunities,”  Ferdi Heyneke , an equity trader at Afrifocus Securities Ltd., said by
telephone.  
 Technical problems led to a 1 1/2-hour delay in the opening
of trade on July 12 and a postponement for 50 minutes on Nov.
30. South Africa’s stock market halted equity trading for the
longest period in at least eight years on July 14, 2008, opening
at 3:10 p.m. after a network problem prevented data from being
disseminated. The problem affected data, including the Stock
Exchange News Service and equity trading from the 9 a.m. open.
