             Hynix Semiconductor Inc.  creditors
today sold a 4.14 percent stake in the world’s second-largest
maker of computer-memory chips at no discount, raising 584.5
billion won ($493 million).  
 Hynix creditors sold 24.4 million shares at 23,950 won
apiece, the stock’s closing price yesterday, to domestic and
foreign institutional investors, the company’s main lender,
Korea Exchange Bank, said in a statement today. The shares were
offered yesterday at 23,200 won to 23,950 won a share.  
 The group of nine financial institutions, which is seeking
to recoup the $4.6 billion spent on bailing out Ichon, South
Korea-based Hynix, owns 15 percent of the company after the
transaction, Korea Exchange Bank said. The group has had
difficulty in finding a buyer for their shareholding.  
 “This will be the last block sale of shares by creditors,
which should lift any share overhang concern,” said  Lee Seung Woo , an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. “Demand for
personal-computer parts may rise gain after mid-August, driven
by inventory rebuilding related to back-to-school demand.”  
 Hynix was down 0.6 percent to 23,800 won as of 10:24 a.m.
in Seoul today. The stock has added 2.8 percent this year,
compared with a 5.5 percent gain in the benchmark  Kospi  stock
index.  
 Creditors sold a 6.7 percent  stake  in Hynix for 923.2
billion won in March after three failed attempts to sell their
entire holding. They’ve said they’ll continue looking for a
strategic purchaser.  
 Hynix last week reported operating profit and sales that
beat analysts’ estimates as demand for PCs and a shortage of the
chips drove up prices. Second-quarter  operating income  was a
record 1.05 trillion won, compared with a loss of 211 billion
won a year earlier. Revenue rose 96 percent to a record 3.28
trillion won.  
 Nomura Holdings Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Woori
Investment & Securities Co. and Shinhan Investment Corp.
arranged the sale.
