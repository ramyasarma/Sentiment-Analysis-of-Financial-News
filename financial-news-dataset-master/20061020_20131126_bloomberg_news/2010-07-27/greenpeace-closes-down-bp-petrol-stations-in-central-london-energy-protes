             Dozens of  BP Plc  petrol stations in
central London were shut down by members of environmental group
Greenpeace, in a protest timed to coincide with the company’s
appointment of a new chief executive officer.  
 Greenpeace said 46 stations were immobilized by small teams
this morning using a shut-off switch to stop the flow of fuel at
each location. As of 3:15 p.m., around half the stations were
still unable to dispense gasoline, said spokesman Graham
Thompson in a telephone interview.  
 The group is targeting the stations to urge BP to move
toward producing more energy from renewable sources, said  John Sauven , Greenpeace U.K. executive director. At one station in
Camden, North London, activists replaced BP’s logo with a
version showing a green sunflower disappearing into a sea of
oil.  
 BP spokeswoman  Sheila Williams  said that around 35
locations were affected and most were functional again. “This
is an act of vandalism which clearly puts the safety of
motorists and staff at the sites at risk,” Williams added. One
of the sites is used to supply ambulances with fuel, she said.  
 Today, BP appointed U.S.-born  Robert Dudley  as CEO and
pledged to accelerate asset sales to as much as $30 billion
after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill led to a record loss.
