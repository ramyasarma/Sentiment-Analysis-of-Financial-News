             Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. , the
Australian marine energy project developer, has won A$250,000
($226,000) in government funding for a trial desalination
project it aims to integrate with wave-power technology.  
 The National Centre of Excellence in Desalination selected
the project from among 61 applicants and will provide half the
funding for the A$500,000 project, Carnegie said in a  statement 
on its website yesterday. Carnegie will provide the other half.  
 The project will be based at NCED headquarters at
Rockingham, south of Perth, close to Carnegie’s Perth Wave
Energy Project site, where Carnegie is testing technology for
generating electricity. Carnegie eventually plans to integrate
the two projects.
