             The Honduran government has failed
to adequately investigate the killings of seven journalists this
year, an “alarming pattern of impunity,” the  Committee to
Protect Journalists  said.  
 The victims were broadcast journalists and the killings
took place from March to the middle of June, the group said in a
 statement  on its website. At least three of the people were
slain because of their reporting, and work-related motives may
have contributed to the other deaths, the group said today.  
 The killings took place in the wake of last year’s coup
that ousted former President  Manuel Zelaya . Supporters of
Zelaya, journalists and other critics have reported being
victims of intimidation and assaults since the overthrow, the
New York-based group said.  
 In one case, the government ignored a mandate from the
 Organization of American States  to provide protection to a
threatened TV anchor who was later gunned down.  
 “The murders occurred in a politically charged atmosphere
of violence and lawlessness,” the Committee to Project
Journalists said. “The government’s ongoing failure to
successfully investigate crimes against journalists and other
social critics -- whether by intention, impotence, or
incompetence -- has created a climate of pervasive impunity.”  
 Honduras is ranked the most dangerous country for
journalists in the world in 2010 by the Paris-based press
freedoms watchdog  Reporters Without Borders .
