-- U.K. Second-Quarter Economic Growth Was a `Blip,' Niesr Says

             The pace of U.K. second-quarter
economic growth was a “blip” and it isn’t time for the Bank of
England to begin removing stimulus, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research said.  
 The U.K. economy  expanded  1.1 percent in the three months
through June, the fastest pace in four years, data last week
showed. That complicates the dilemma policy makers face as they
mull whether the economy faces a greater threat from  inflation 
or needs more stimulus as the government implements the deepest
budget squeeze since World War II.  
 “I don’t think that growth rate will be sustained,” Niesr
economist  Simon Kirby  told reporters in London. “Far from that,
I think the growth rate will fall back somewhat quite sharply.”  
 Bank of England official  Andrew Sentance  this month
repeated his call for the central bank to begin raising interest
rates, citing “resilient” inflation. While the Monetary Policy
Committee voted to leave its  benchmark rate  on hold at its July
8 meeting, members “considered arguments in favour of a modest
easing,” minutes of the decision showed.  
 “I wouldn’t expect any change whatsoever over the next few
months,” Kirby said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“They’ll want to see how strong gross domestic product grows in
the third quarter of this year.”  
 Economic Forecasts  
 Niesr sees economic growth of 0.1 percent in the current
quarter and 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter. While the
institute raised its forecast for 2010 economic growth to 1.3
percent from 1 percent in April in a  quarterly report  published
in London today, it lowered the 2011 projection to 1.7 percent
from 2 percent.  
 “I still think the next move by the Bank of England will
be to tighten policy, but that will be in probably the second
quarter of next year at the earliest,” Kirby said. “But
clearly there are risks around the forecast.”  
 “We would advise the MPC to make no change at the next few
meetings as they assess whether this robust growth persists,”
Niesr said, referring to the second-quarter expansion.  
 Kirby sees inflation remaining above the Bank of England’s
2 percent target until 2012 because of the government’s planned
sales-tax increase. He previously forecast it would drop below
that level next year.  Inflation  was at 3.2 percent in June.  
 While the economy may expand about 2.5 percent a year from
2013, there are “downside” risks in the short term, Kirby
said. “We shouldn’t automatically rule out the chance of a
quarter or two of it actually contracting in the U.K. over the
next couple of years.”
