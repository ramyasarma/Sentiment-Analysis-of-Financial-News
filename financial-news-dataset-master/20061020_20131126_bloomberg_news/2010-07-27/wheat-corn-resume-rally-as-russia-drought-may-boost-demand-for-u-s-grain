             Wheat rose for the first time in
three sessions and corn gained after Russia said a prolonged
drought may force the government to further reduce its estimate
of the grain output.  
 The harvest may drop below 80 million metric tons, compared
with the current estimate of 85 million, Deputy Economy Minister
 Andrei Klepach  said today. Russian grain traders may halt new
export agreements because the government may limit shipments,
the Moscow-based researcher SovEcon said last week.  
 “People are concerned that Russia may ban exports,” said
 Brian Grete , the senior market analyst for Professional Farmers
of America Newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Demand may increase
for crops from the U.S., the biggest exporter of wheat and corn,
Grete said.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 5.25 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $5.9475 a bushel at 10:19 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. During the previous two sessions, the price fell
1.2 percent. Before today, the grain rose 38 percent since June
9 as drought damaged crops in parts of Europe and Russia and too
much rain in Canada reduced the area planted this year.  
 Corn futures for December delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.8025 a bushel on the CBOT, after yesterday
touching $3.7575, the lowest level for a most-active contract
since July 1. Before today, the commodity gained 9.9 percent
since June 29, the day before the government said U.S. farmers
planted less this year than they had planned.  
 Smaller Harvest  
 Russia’s grain harvest may fall below 70 million tons as
yields drop amid the worst drought in at least a decade, SovEcon
said today. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast Russian
production at 79.8 million tons earlier this month, down from
93.5 million last year.  
 The price of wheat in the European part of Russia rose 15
percent to 4,850 rubles ($160) a ton in the week ending July 23,
SovEcon said. Barley added 30 percent to 3,350 rubles a ton
during the week, while rye climbed 33 percent to 3,400 rubles a
ton.  
 “The Russian crop problems are not just about wheat,”
said  Chad  Henderson, a market analyst for Prime Consultants Inc.
in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “The trend has shifted from rising
inventories to declining supplies.”  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.
