             DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. , maker
of the “Shrek” feature films, reported second-quarter profit
declined 6.2 percent in the absence of a new home-video release.  
 Net income dropped to $24 million, or 27 cents a share,
from $25.6 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Profit beat the
24 cents average of 16 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 20 percent to $158.1 million, the
Glendale, California-based company said today in a statement.  
 Production costs are typically recorded when films are in
theaters, making DVDs more profitable than box-office sales. In
the absence of a new home-video release, the company was more
dependent on cinema revenue.  
 “There was really a revenue-mix difference,”  Lew Coleman, 
president and chief financial officer, said in an interview.  
 DVD versions of “How to Train Your Dragon” and “Shrek
Forever After” will be released in the fourth quarter, the
company said in the statement. The company’s next theatrical
release, the 3-D “Megamind,” will be out on Nov. 5.  
 Sales exceeded analysts’ recently lowered projections of
$141.3 million, helped by “Shrek Forever After,” which has had
$603 million in worldwide box-office sales, the company said.
“How to Train Your Dragon,” released on March 26, contributed
$33.4 million, mostly from theatrical sales.  
 DreamWorks Animation rose $1.02 to $33.10 in extended
trading. The stock gained 40 cents to $32.08 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market  trading  and has declined 20 percent
this year.  
 The company predicted lower earnings on June 17, citing the
domestic box-office performance of “Shrek Forever After” and
the timing of home-video releases.  
 The company’s production costs for 3-D films are expected
to drop to an average of about $135 million from $145 million
over the next year because of efficiencies, Coleman said.
