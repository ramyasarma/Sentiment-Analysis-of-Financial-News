             Centennial Coal Ltd. , the Australian
producer that agreed to a A$2 billion ($1.8 billion) takeover by
Thailand’s Banpu Plc, said fourth-quarter sales rose 13 percent.  
 Sales increased to 3.75 million metric tons in the three
months ended June 30, from 3.33 million metric tons the year
before, Sydney-based Centennial said in a statement. Asia’s
demand for coal is strong, the company said.  
 Banpu, which this month agreed to pay A$6.20 cash a share
for the 80 percent of Centennial it doesn’t own, will
temporarily withdraw its application to Australia’s Foreign
Investment Review board to approve the deal because of the
federal election, the Bangkok-based company said yesterday. The
bid has been recommended by Centennial directors.  
 Centennial, which has  climbed  51 percent since the start of
the year, rose 0.7 percent, to A$6.03 at 11:03 a.m. Sydney time.  
 Centennial owns 10 mines in New South Wales and sells as
much as 35 percent of its coal into the export market, according
to its website. Customers include power stations and steel mills
in Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India and Europe.
