             U.K. stocks  climbed for a second
day, led by a rally in banks, after the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision relaxed some of its proposed capital and
liquidity rules.  
 Barclays Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc advanced more
than 7 percent. AstraZeneca Plc climbed 2 percent after U.S.
regulators said they may clear the drugmaker’s blood-thinner
Brilinta. Tullow Oil Plc advanced 2.7 percent after completing
the sale of Heritage Oil & Gas Ltd.’s Ugandan assets.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  rose 14.55, or 0.3 percent, to
5,365.67 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, extending its gain
from this year’s low on July 1 to 12 percent. The  FTSE All-Share
Index  advanced 0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index 
fell 0.1 percent as of Ryanair Holdings Plc retreated.  
 The market is “showing signs of relief after news that the
Basel Committee will relax some of its tougher proposals,” said
 Joshua Raymond , a London-based market strategist at City Index.
“Investors are hopeful that with fewer locks and chains around
bank activities than first feared, they may be able to report
higher earnings to their shareholders.”  
 Barclays led a  gauge  of U.K. banks to a three-month high
after the Basel Committee yesterday agreed to allow certain
assets, including minority stakes in other financial firms, to
count as capital. The panel also set a leverage ratio to apply
to banks globally for the first time, which could become binding
by 2018, pending further adjustments to the method of
calculating banks’ assets.  
 Barclays, Lloyds Jump  
 Barclays, the U.K.’s third-largest bank, jumped 7.6 percent
to 339.55 pence. Lloyds rallied 8.8 percent to 71.8 pence and
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc increased 7.9 percent to 50.35
pence.  
 Financial shares received a further boost as UBS AG and
Deutsche Bank AG, the biggest banks in Switzerland and Germany,
posted earnings that beat analyst estimates.  
 AstraZeneca climbed 2 percent to 3,189 pence after U.S.
Food and Drug Administration advisers said Brilinta is
approvable if the drugmaker undertakes a study on its
effectiveness in Americans once it’s marketed. Brilinta sales
could reach $1.47 billion by 2016, according to the average
estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Tullow Oil  increased 2.7 percent to 1,273 pence after the
company completed its acquisition of Heritage Oil’s Ugandan
assets for $1.35 billion and agreed to sell interests to Cnooc
Ltd. and Total SA.  
 The company bought 50 percent in blocks 1 and 3A from
Heritage for an “additional contractual settlement of $100
million” and agreed to sell two-thirds of blocks 1, 2 and 3A in
the Lake Albert Rift Basin. Heritage Oil gained 1.1 percent to
415 pence.  
 Ryanair  slid 2.9 percent to 3.84 euros after Chief
Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  sold 5 million shares in
Europe’s largest discount airline at 3.90 euros apiece.  
 The following stocks either rose or fell in the U.K. and
Irish market.  
 BP Plc  (BP/ LN) declined 10.95 pence, or 2.6 percent, to
406, paring some of yesterday’s 4.6 percent rally. The energy
company, which today appointed U.S.-born  Robert Dudley  as chief
executive officer, said it is being investigated by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in matters related to the
Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 BP also reported a record loss and pledged to accelerate
asset sales to as much as $30 billion.  
 Croda International Plc  (CRDA LN) rallied 99 pence, or 8.4
percent, to 1,272 after the British maker of chemicals and
ingredients for cosmetics reported first-half earnings of 96.2
million pounds, beating some analysts’ estimates.  
 InterContinental Hotels Group Plc  (IHG LN) tumbled 89
pence, or 7.4 percent, to 1,110. The billionaire Barclay
brothers sold their 10 percent stake in the owner of the Holiday
Inn brand for about 335 million pounds ($520 million).  
 Informa Plc  (INF LN) gained 7.1 pence, or 1.8 percent, to
394.7 after the U.K. publisher of Lloyd’s List said it expects
earnings to improve as profitability in the first half
increased. Analysts at Numis Securities upgraded the shares to
“buy” from “add” today.  
 Provident Financial Plc  (PFG LN) dropped 61.5 pence, or 7
percent, to 821 even after the U.K.’s biggest subprime lender
reported increased first-half profit.  
 “For 2010 we don’t see any real catalyst for improvement
in the labor market and that’s what we’d be looking to in order
to see demand from customers increase and also to loosen our own
tight underwriting,” Chief Executive Officer  Peter Crook  said
in an interview. Analysts at Collins Stewart downgraded the
shares to “sell” from “hold.”
