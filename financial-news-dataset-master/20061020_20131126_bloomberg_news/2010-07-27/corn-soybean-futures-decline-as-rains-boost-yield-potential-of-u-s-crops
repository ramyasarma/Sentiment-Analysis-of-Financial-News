             Corn and soybeans fell, erasing
earlier gains, on speculation that rain will improve yield
potential of crops in the U.S., the biggest producer and
exporter.  
 Up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of rain since yesterday
has relieved dry soil conditions in the South,  QT Weather  in
Chicago said in a report. The forecaster said crops throughout
the country will benefit from four storms over the next two
weeks. About 72 percent of the nation’s corn and 67 percent of
the soybeans were rated good or excellent as July 25, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  
 “When it is raining in July, U.S. crops usually get bigger
and prices fall,” said  Bill Biedermann , a senior vice president
for Allendale Inc., a researcher and brokerage in McHenry,
Illinois. “Crop conditions suggest the potential for record
yields this year.”  
 Corn futures for December delivery fell 1 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.77 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
earlier rising 1.3 percent. Yesterday, the most-active contract
touched $3.7575, the lowest level since July 1. The commodity
has gained 9.6 percent since June 29, the day before the
government said U.S. farmers planted less this year than they
had planned.  
 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.5 cent to
$9.655 a bushel, erasing an earlier gain of 0.8 percent.
Yesterday, the price dropped 1.6 percent, the most since June 4.  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government figures
show.
