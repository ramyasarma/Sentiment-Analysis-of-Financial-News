             Hong Kong’s government may sell a
building site in the Peak district for HK$10.5 billion ($1.35
billion) in an  auction  tomorrow, underscoring demand for high-
end properties in the city.  
 The estimate for the Mt. Nicholson Road site is the median
of seven analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Their forecasts
ranged from HK$8.9 billion to HK$11.5 billion, or HK$27,000 to
HK$35,000 per square foot in terms of gross floor area.  
 The government is trying to curb a 38 percent  surge  in home
prices since the beginning of 2009 amid concerns housing is out
of reach of ordinary residents. The outcome of tomorrow’s
auction may further buoy Hong Kong’s luxury homes prices, said
Ricky Poon, a Hong Kong-based executive director of residential
sales at Colliers International Ltd.  
 “A better-than-expected result at this auction will have a
huge impact on buyer sentiment,” said Poon. He said he expects
the site to fetch between HK$28,000 and HK$30,000 a square foot,
and “anything beyond that will give the luxury property market
a big boost.”  
 The city’s home prices have gained 9.6 percent this year
and last week rose to the highest since 1997, Centaline Property
Agency Ltd. said July 23. Home prices may rise another 10
percent in the second half if interest rates stay at two-decade
lows and the local economy keeps growing, property consultant
Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. said this month.  
 Authorities have introduced rules on new home sales and are
investigating canceled sales at a  Henderson Land Development Co. 
luxury apartment project.  
 Aggressive Bidding  
 Demand for luxury properties is being supported by a lack
of new supply and an influx of mainland Chinese buyers, who
account for about 20 percent of local residential transactions
this year, said Collier’s Poon.  
 The site at 103 Mt. Nicholson Road, formerly used for
government staff quarters, has a total gross floor area of
324,861 square feet (30,180 square meters). The auction was
initiated by the government, which has pledged to increase land
supply as part of its measures to keep home prices in check.  
 “Tomorrow’s auction will attract aggressive bidding from
developers because of its prime location and harbor view,” said
Alnwick Chan, a Hong Kong-based executive director at property
consultant Knight Frank LLP. “It’s not easy to find another
site on a similar scale on Hong Kong Island that could be used
for building houses.”  
 Martin Lee , the youngest son of  Henderson Land  billionaire
chairman  Lee Shau-kee , in May paid HK$1.82 billion, or a record
HK$68,200 per square foot, for a site on Barker Road in the Peak
district at an auction held by Jones Lang. Lee said afterwards
he would use the site to build houses for his family.  
 Most government land sales in recent years have been
triggered by  developers  who promised to pay minimum amounts for
sites on a list of available plots under the so-called land
application system. Regular government land auctions were halted
in 2004 to support falling home prices.  
 Last Auction  
 Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. , the world’s biggest developer
by market value, last month bought a site in the Ho Man Tin
district for HK$10.9 billion. At HK$12,540 per square foot, it
was the highest price paid in a government auction in urban Hong
Kong since the market peaked in 1997. The gross floor area for
the site is 869,000 square feet.  
 The  Hang Seng Property Index , tracking seven of Hong Kong’s
biggest developers, has risen 11.4 percent since the last
auction on June 8, outperforming the 6.9 percent gain in the
 Hang Seng Index . The index rose 0.3 percent at 10:57 a.m. in
Hong Kong today.  
 Sun Hung Kai said it sold 300 flats at Larvotto, a harbor-
front luxury apartment project in Hong Kong’s Island South
district, over the past two weekends. The sales brought in a
total of HK$8 billion in revenue for the company and partners
Kerry Properties Ltd. and Paliburg Holdings Ltd., it said.  
 Luxury homes in Hong Kong are those at least 1,000 square
feet or costing at least HK$10 million.
