             Verbund AG, Austria’s largest
utility, sees its planned 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) capital 
hike in the fourth quarter of this year “at the earliest.”  
 “The exact date will depend largely on the market
environment,” the Vienna-based company said in a statement on
its website today.
