             South African winemaker Graham Beck
died in London at the age of 80, leaving behind four farms that
he said should carry on as normal after he passed away.  
 “It’s business as usual, that was his wish,” Etienne
Heyns, marketing manager of  Graham Beck Wines , said in a
telephone interview from Franschhoek, near Cape Town. Beck’s
body is being flown to Israel today for burial.  
 Graham Beck wines, a popular choice in South African bottle
stores and restaurants for 27 years, range from Railroad Red to
the  Graham Beck Rhona Rose NV , a sparkling wine with a five-star
rating by  Marks & Spencer Group Plc . The sparkling wine is made
in South Africa’s  Method Cap Classique  style, which imitates the
way France’s best champagnes are produced, and is named after
Beck’s wife, Rhona, who was at his side when he died yesterday.  
 Beck left South Africa about two months ago, according to
Heyns, because he liked to spend time at his home in Kensington,
London, during the worst of Cape Town’s winter. Beck is survived
by his wife of 50 years and his son, Antony, who runs one of the
family trust’s stud farms in Kentucky, he said.
