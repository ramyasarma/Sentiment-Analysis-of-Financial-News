             Gas Natural SDG SA , Spain’s largest
gas company, plans to invest at a slower pace through 2012 as it
tries to cut debt following the acquisition of the utility  Union
Fenosa SA .  
 Average annual gross investment will fall to 1.8 billion
euros ($2.3 billion) a year from 2010 through 2012 from about
2.1 billion euros last year as the company spends on its
distribution and generation units, Barcelona-based Gas Natural
said today in a regulatory filing. The company aims to reduce
net debt to 15 billion euros to 16 billion euros in 2012.  
 Net debt  declined to 19.75 billion euros at the end of June
from 22.1 billion euros a year earlier, the company said in a
separate statement on financial results.  
 Gas Natural completed the  purchase  of Fenosa last year,
gaining access to gas-liquefaction and regasification plants as
well as electricity generation capacity. The acquisition is
helping it cope with fluctuations in demand and greater
competition in the domestic gas market. Spanish gas demand has
climbed this year after dropping 11 percent in 2009.  
 The company has “capacity to accelerate growth under the
appropriate conditions,” Gas Natural said today in a
presentation. Gas Natural may consider investing as much as 13
billion euros through 2014.  
 Shares Fall  
 Gas Natural  fell 2.2 percent to close at 12.97 euros at
5:30 p.m. in Madrid. The stock has dropped 14 percent so far
this year, cutting Gas Natural’s market value to 12 billion
euros.  
 Gas Natural aims to boost dividends at least 10 percent a
year from 2010 to 2014, the company said in the presentation. It
targets net income of about 1.5 billion euros in 2012 and
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
more than 5 billion euros.  
 “We are convinced that even in a negative regulatory
scenario we will be able to increase the dividend,” Chief
Executive Officer  Rafael Villaseca  said on a conference call.  
 Moody’s Investors Service on July 14 said that the Spanish
government’s review of the electricity industry increases
regulatory risk for the country’s power companies.  
 First-half  net income  climbed 37 percent to 853 million
euros, the company said in its financial statement. That
compares with the 920 million-euro average estimate in a
 Bloomberg survey  of analysts. First-half Ebitda rose 48 percent
to 2.38 billion euros.  
 Sell Plant  
 Gas Natural on July 12 said it agreed to sell the Plana del
Vent gas-fired plant, part of a plan to sell gas-fueled stations
with a capacity of 2,000 megawatts to meet competition rules
following the Fenosa acquisition. Including the disposal of that
plant, Gas Natural aims to sell about 1.5 billion euros of
assets from 2010 through 2012, it said today.  
 Earlier this year, Gas Natural sold a 5 percent stake in
Indra Sistemas SA, a Spanish computer-services company. In 2009
it agreed to sell stakes in its generation units in Mexico and a
holding in  Empresa de Energia del Pacifico SA  of Colombia, as
well as distribution assets in Madrid and other areas.  
 Gas Natural had electricity generation capacity of 15,598
megawatts in Spain and abroad at the end of June. So-called
combined cycle power plants accounted for 59 percent, hydropower
12 percent and coal-fired plants 13 percent of capacity.  
 The company may add 1,200 megawatts of additional renewable
energy capacity in Spain by 2014 and forecasts its total
installed capacity will range between 15,600 megawatts and
17,700 megawatts in 2014.  
 Gas Natural also plans to increase sales of natural gas
outside Spain and said in the presentation that the increase of
regasification capacity in regions including Europe and Latin
America “opens opportunities” to enter new markets.  
 Chairman  Salvador Gabarro  said today on the conference call
that he has no information on oil producer Repsol YPF SA selling
its stake in Gas Natural. Repsol owns 31 percent of Gas Natural,
while holding company Criteria CaixaCorp SA has 37 percent.
