             Crude oil tumbled the most in more
than three weeks in New York after the Conference Board reported
confidence among U.S. consumers fell, a sign that economic
growth and energy demand may be restrained.  
 Oil lost 1.9 percent as the confidence index declined to
the lowest level in five months. The gauge was at 50.4 from a
revised 54.3 in June, the New York-based private research group
showed today. It was forecast to drop to 51, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 “At the first sign of economic weakness, oil is pulling
back a little bit,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research
at PFGBest in Chicago. “There’s a glut of supply, we’re past
the summer driving season and there’s not a lot of tropical
activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Other than the hope the economy
will explode, there aren’t a lot of reasons to be long.”  
 Crude for September delivery decreased $1.48 to settle at
$77.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
decline since July 1. Oil has fallen 2.3 percent this year.  
 Prices declined from the settlement after the American
Petroleum Institute reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles increased 3.08 million barrels to 356.3 million.
September oil fell $1.68, or 2.1 percent, to $77.30 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  
 Estimates for consumer confidence ranged from 46 to 55.5 in
the Bloomberg survey of 73 economists after a previously
reported 52.9 reading in June. The Conference Board measure
averaged 98 during the expansion that ended in December 2007.  
 Oil Supplies  
 A government report tomorrow may show U.S. oil inventories
dropped to a four-month low, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Supplies in the week ended July 16 were at the highest
level in 17 years for the third week in July.  
 U.S. stockpiles fell 1.73 million barrels, or 0.5 percent,
in the seven days ended July 23 from 353.5 million the week
earlier, according to the  median estimate  of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The last time supplies were so low was
the week ended March 19, when prices averaged $81.46 a barrel.  
 The Energy Department report is scheduled for release at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow in Washington.  
 Tropical Storm Bonnie dissipated on July 24 without
damaging Gulf of Mexico production platforms or refineries.
Producers idled as much as 52 percent of U.S. Gulf oil output
and have restored all but 15 percent of the total, according to
the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement.  
 Buying Opportunities  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said crude prices are too cheap.
In a report yesterday, Goldman said futures prices are
“significantly” below the level warranted by “fundamentals,”
offering buying opportunities for this year and next.  
 The balance between supply and demand will continue to
tighten in the second half of this year as global economic
growth boosts demand, returning inventories to “more normal”
levels, according to the report.  
 U.S. fuel demand  in the four weeks ended July 16 fell
23,000 barrels a day to an average 19.2 million from the prior
period, according to the Energy Department. The four-week
average has dropped 2.6 percent since the week ended June 4.
Demand for July is the second-lowest in more than a decade,
after 2009.  
 Gasoline Demand  
 Gasoline demand rose 1.7 percent last week, as U.S.
motorists bought an average 9.51 million barrels a day of the
motor fuel in the week ended July 23, according to MasterCard
Inc.’s SpendingPulse report today. The gain was the second in a
row and the sixth in seven weeks.  
 Oil touched $79.69 a barrel, the highest level since May 6,
in intraday trading today as global equities gained before the
consumer confidence report.  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 1.17 points to
1,113.84. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 12.26 points
to 10,537.69.  
 Iranian Oil Minister  Masoud Mir-Kazemi  said yesterday that
new sanctions imposed by European Union governments won’t
curtail the country’s oil production. The country is the second-
largest oil producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, after Saudi Arabia.  
 The measures, designed to back U.S. efforts to force Iran
to halt uranium enrichment and stop any potential pursuit of a
nuclear weapons capability, include a ban on new investment in
or equipment sales to Iran’s oil and natural-gas industries.  
 Brent crude for September settlement fell $1.37, or 1.8
percent, to $76.13 a barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 507,056
contracts as of 4:27 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 331,200
contracts yesterday, 53 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.24 million contracts.
