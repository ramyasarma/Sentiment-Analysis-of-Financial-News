             The Rolling Stones , whose hits
include “Satisfaction” and “Sympathy for the Devil,” are in
talks with promoters  AEG Live  and  Live Nation Entertainment Inc .
for a tour, according to a person who declined to be identified
because talks are private.  
 The Stones are planning concerts in the next few years and
haven’t yet signed a contract, said the person. An auction for
the tour has been under way for about a month and a group of
independent promoters is also bidding, the person said.  
 A spokesman for the band declined to comment on the auction
and said The Rolling Stones have no plans to retire. The U.K.’s
Sun newspaper reported last weekend that the group’s 50th
anniversary shows would be its last. Spokespeople for Live
Nation and AEG Live declined to comment.  
 The band, which turns 50 in two years, holds the record for
the most profitable tour with the 2005-2006 “A Bigger Bang,”
which took in $558.3 million, according to music news website
Spinner. With record sales plunging 30 percent in the past
decade and illegal downloads of music accounting for almost all
music heard online, live performance has become the industry’s
most lucrative and fastest-growing segment.  
 Fans are paying twice the price for tickets to top concerts
compared with a decade ago. Artists who once performed live to
promote record sales are now churning out albums to boost
attendance at shows.  
 Higher Concert Sales  
 AC/DC , whose hits include “Back in Black” and “Highway
to Hell” will probably be the second-highest grossing tour band
when figures are tallied from their “Black Ice” shows which
concluded last weekend, according to Spinner. The concerts may
have taken in $441.6 million, the website said.  
 The live performance market raked in $21.6 billion in 2008,
an increase of 54 percent in three years, according to the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Recorded
music sales last year were $18.4 billion.  
 Record companies are scrambling to find ways to get a piece
of the live action. They’re signing artists to so-called 360
deals, where they get a portion of an artist’s rights to
recorded music, tours, merchandise and marketing.  
 Live Nation Inc., the world’s largest concert promoter, has
360 deals with Madonna and Shakira.
