             Spain sold 3.4 billion euros ($4.42
billion) of Treasury bills as its borrowing costs fell in the
first debt sale since European Union stress tests of banks.  
 Spain today sold 971.4 million euros of three-month bills
at an average rate of 0.672, compared with a yield of 0.913
percent at an auction in June, the Treasury said. It also sold
2.46 billion euros of six-month debt at an average rate of 1.144
percent, down from 1.577 percent last month.  
 The risk  premium  on Spanish debt has declined since the
Bank of Spain published stress tests on the nation’s lenders,
showing a capital shortfall in the most extreme scenario of 1.8
billion euros. The government, which is trying to cut the third-
largest budget deficit in the euro region while returning the
economy to growth after an almost two-year recession, has
already raised the funds that the savings banks may need,
Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said on July 23.  
 “The improved market mood is a consequence of the stress
tests,” said  Giuseppe Maraffino , a fixed income strategist at
Barclays Capital in London. “The yields were quite attractive
and that, plus the improved mood, explains the strong demand.”  
 The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds rather than German equivalents fell further after the
auction. The spread was 137 basis points at 12:20 p.m. in
Madrid, compared with 148 basis points yesterday and 170 basis
points on July 22, the day before stress tests were published.  
 Market Access  
 Spain aimed for the tests to improve its financial
institutions’ access to capital markets. Spanish lenders
borrowed a record 126.3 billion euros from the ECB in June, up
48 percent from the previous month, according to data compiled
by the Bank of Spain. That compares with a drop of 4 percent to
496.6 billion euros for euro-area lenders as a whole.  
 Jacobo Gonzalez-Robatto , chief financial officer of  Banco
Popular Espanol SA , said today that there are “signs” that
wholesale funding markets are reopening for Spanish lenders.  
 Fitch Ratings cut Spain’s credit rating to AA+ on May 28,
citing concerns about the economy’s ability to grow. Standard &
Poor’s Ratings Services ranks Spain AA, while Moody’s Investors
Service put the country’s rating on review for a possible
downgrade on June 30, citing deteriorating growth prospects and
the risk the government won’t meet its fiscal targets.  
 As a result of the deepest austerity measures in three
decades that include public wage cuts, a reduction in investment
and a pension freeze, the government revised its growth forecast
for next year to 1.3 percent from 1.8 percent. That’s still more
than double the International Monetary Fund’s 0.6 percent
forecast.  
 Even with Spain’s budget deficit at 11.2 percent of gross
domestic product, more than three times the EU limit, its debt
amounted to 53 percent of GDP last year, lower than in Germany
and less than the euro-region average of 79 percent.
