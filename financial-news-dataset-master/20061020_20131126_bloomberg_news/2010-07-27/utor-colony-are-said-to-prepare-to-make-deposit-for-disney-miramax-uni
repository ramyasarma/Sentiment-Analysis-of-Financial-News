             Construction executive Ronald Tutor
and private-equity firm Colony Capital LLC plan to make a
deposit on their proposed purchase of Walt Disney Co.’s Miramax
film division, said two people with knowledge of the situation.  
 The buyers have informed Disney they will make the
nonrefundable payment by tomorrow’s deadline, said the people,
who asked not to be named because the talks are private. An
announcement may come as soon as tomorrow, they said.
