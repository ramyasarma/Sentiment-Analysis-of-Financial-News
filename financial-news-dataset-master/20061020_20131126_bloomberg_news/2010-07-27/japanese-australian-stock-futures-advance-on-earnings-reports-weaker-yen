             Japanese  stock   futures  rose as
companies from Canon Inc. to Fanuc Ltd. reported higher profits
and the yen weakened. Australian futures also climbed.  
 American depositary receipts of Canon, the world’s largest
camera maker, surged 3.3 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of  Sony Corp. , a Japanese electronics maker that
gets about 70 percent of sales abroad, jumped 2.8 percent as the
yen weakened and after JPMorgan Chase & Co. increased its
investment recommendation. ADRs of Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,
Australia’s second-largest oil and gas producer, fell 0.6
percent after oil prices dropped.  
 Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,635 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,515 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,610 in
Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index advanced 0.4 percent in Wellington.  
 “Overall, corporate earnings are improving and
expectations for strong earnings will likely increase,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial
Securities Inc.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.1
percent. In New York yesterday, the index slipped 0.1 percent as
retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. Inc. slid
after consumer confidence retreated to a five-month low.  
 U.S. Consumer Confidence  
 The Conference Board’s index of confidence among U.S.
consumers fell to 50.4 in July from a revised 54.3 in June. The
gauge was forecast to drop to 51, according the median
estimatein a Bloomberg News survey.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  has declined 2 percent in 2010,
compared with a 0.1 percent drop by the  S&P 500  and a 1.7
percent gain by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 14.2 times estimated  earnings , compared
with 13.5 times for the S&P and 12 times for the Stoxx.  
 Canon  said yesterday after the close of trading in Tokyo
that its net income more than quadrupled to 67.6 billion yen
($779 million) in the three months ended June 30 from a year
earlier. That exceeded the median estimate of 58 billion yen,
based on three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. The
company left its full-year forecast unchanged.  
 The result was a “positive surprise,”  Masahiro Shibano ,
an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc., said in a
Japanese-language report. “It’s good news that the company
maintained its profit forecast because there were strong
concerns that Canon may cut its outlook against the backdrop of
steep declines in the euro.”  
 Yen Boost  
 Fanuc , a Japanese maker of industrial robots, reported net
income of 24.8 billion yen for the three months ended June 30,
up from 4.95 billion yen a year earlier. Sales more than doubled
to 99.7 billion yen from 45.7 billion yen.  
 The yen depreciated to as low as 87.98 against the
dollarcompared with 86.98 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday. Against the euro, it weakened to 114.42 from 113.17.
A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  
 Crude oil for September delivery tumbled 1.9 percent to
$77.50 a barrel in New York yesterday, the biggest decline since
July 1. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and zinc lost 1.1 percent yesterday.
