             Hungary sold more debt than planned
at an auction of three-month Treasury bills today as traders
said yields were attractive given the interest-rate outlook.  
 The government raised 50 billion forint ($228 million) of
Treasury bills maturing on Nov. 3 compared with a planned amount
of 45 billion forint, according to the debt management agency’s
Bloomberg page. Investors bid for 133.3 billion forint versus
52.5 billion at the previous auction on July 20, when the agency
cut issuance by 10 billion forint from its target. The average
yield at today’s auction was 5.46 percent, compared with 5.47
percent a week ago, the highest since March 2.  
 “Investors apparently think that the central bank will not
have to raise interest rates in the short term and thus current
Hungarian yields are more than wonderful,”  Gyorgy Cselenyi , a
bonds trader at BNP Paribas in Budapest, said by telephone.  
 Hungary last week fell short of its target at a sale of
three-month bills. That was the first attempt to sell debt after
the International Monetary Fund and European Union ended talks
with government officials on July 17 without endorsing Hungary’s
plans for controlling the  budget deficit . Standard & Poor’s and
Moody’s Investors Service said last week they may downgrade the
country’s debt rating.  
 Forint  
 The yield on the benchmark three-month bill on the
secondary market was 5.55 percent yesterday, staying at the
highest level since March 10.  
 The forint is the world’s worst-performing currency against
the euro in the past three months, having lost 8.1 percent from
April 26 through yesterday. The currency traded at 284.98 per
euro at 11:54 a.m. in Budapest, compared with 286.46 late
yesterday.  
 On July 19, the forint fell to the lowest since April 2009.
Central bank President  Andras Simor  said interest rates may rise
in case of a sustained increase in risk premiums. S&P on July 23
said it may cut Hungary’s credit rating to junk.
