             Singapore Airlines Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest carrier by market value, said it is considering
“several” candidates to become chief executive officer as  Chew Choon Seng  signaled that he will step down.  
 “It’s at the mercy of the  board , but I am getting on in
years,” Chew, who turns 64 today, said after a shareholders
meeting in Singapore. “I should move on.”  
 Singapore Airlines  shares have doubled since Chew, whose
contract expires in December, took over at the carrier in 2003
when the SARS crisis hammered air travel in Asia. He managed an
unbroken run of  annual profits  even as the carrier faced record
jet-fuel prices, the global recession and repeated delays in
deliveries of its Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos.  
 “Chew has a very steady hand,” said  Rohan Suppiah , an
analyst at Kim Eng Securities Pte in Singapore. “His ability to
pull the airline out of difficult operating times is
fantastic.”  
 The airline is “on schedule” to find a successor for
Chew, said Chairman  Stephen Lee . The company has looked at
“several” candidates, both within and outside the company, he
said, without elaboration.  
 Empty Planes  
 Chew took over from Cheong Choong Kong in June 2003 when
the deadly respiratory virus emptied planes. Under Chew, the
carrier posted a record S$2.13 billion ($1.6 billion) profit in
the year ended in March 2007. In October that year, he
introduced the A380, making Singapore Airlines the first carrier
to fly the world’s biggest passenger jet.  
 Profit  slid to S$216 million last year -- the worst in more
than two decades -- as the global recession hurt travel.
Yesterday, the airline reported a third straight quarterly
profit as a rebounding global economy revives travel demand.  
 The carrier may post a profit of S$1.3 billion in the year
ending in March, according to the  average  of 23 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  
 The airline gained 1.8 percent to S$15.02 today in
Singapore, the biggest gain in more than two weeks. The shares
have increased 0.5 percent this year, lagging behind the
benchmark Straits Times Index’s 2.8 percent advance.  
 A veteran of more than three decades at the airline, Chew
is a mechanical engineer with a Master’s of Science degree from
London’s Imperial College.
