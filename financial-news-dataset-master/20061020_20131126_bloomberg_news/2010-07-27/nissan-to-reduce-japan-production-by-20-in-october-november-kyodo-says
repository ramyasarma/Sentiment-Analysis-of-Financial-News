             Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive
Officer Carlos Ghosn said the automaker will produce 20 percent
fewer cars in Japan in October and November, compared with
September production plans, Kyodo News reported.  
 The decrease stems from a stronger yen and the expiration
of a government incentive program for car purchases, Kyodo said,
citing Ghosn.
