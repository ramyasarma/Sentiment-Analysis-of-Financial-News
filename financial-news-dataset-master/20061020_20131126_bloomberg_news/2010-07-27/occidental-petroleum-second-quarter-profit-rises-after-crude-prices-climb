             Occidental Petroleum Corp. , the U.S.
oil company that bought Citigroup Inc.’s Phibro energy-trading
unit last year, said second-quarter profit rose after crude
prices increased.  
 Net income climbed to $1.1 billion, or $1.31 a share, from
$682 million, or 84 cents, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based
 Occidental  said today in a Business Wire statement.  
 Oil futures traded in New York averaged $78.05 a barrel in
the second quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.
Occidental is focused on finding crude on land in the U.S. and
in such overseas  locations  as Libya, Yemen and Colombia. The
company doesn’t operate in the Gulf of Mexico, where BP Plc’s
record oil spill led to a moratorium on deep-water drilling.  
 In May,  Occidental  doubled its estimate for a discovery
near Bakersfield, California, to the equivalent of as much as
500 million barrels of oil.  
 The statement was released before the opening of regular
U.S. stock trading.  Occidental  rose 78 cents to $82.92 yesterday
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has 17
buy  ratings  from analysts, 3 holds and 1 sell.  
 Profit from the Occidental  unit  that includes Phibro jumped
more than sixfold in the first quarter to $94 million.  
 (Occidental is scheduled to hold an earnings conference
call for investors, starting at 11:30 a.m. New York time. To
