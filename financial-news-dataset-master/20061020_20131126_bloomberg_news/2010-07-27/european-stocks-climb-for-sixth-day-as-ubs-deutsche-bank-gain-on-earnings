             European stocks  climbed for a sixth
day as UBS AG and Deutsche Bank AG reported earnings that beat
estimates the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision softened
its proposed capital rules.  
 UBS surged the most in 15 months as a  measure of banking
shares  rose to a three-month high. Deutsche Bank, Germany’s
largest lender, climbed 4.5 percent. Tomkins Plc soared 5.4
percent after agreeing to be bought by the Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board and Onex Corp.  
 The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 0.4 percent to 258.11 at
the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London, extending a five-week
high. The gauge has still retreated 5.2 percent from this year’s
high on April 15 amid concern that austerity measures from
indebted European governments will harm the economic recovery.  
 “I am happy about the figures, which beat really high
expectations,” said  Philipp Musil , who helps oversee $10
billion at Semper Constantia Privatbank AG in Vienna, referring
to the Deutsche Bank and UBS earnings. “The market is near the
top end of the trading range and there’s a new positive feeling
about Europe.”  
 Stocks pared gains after a report showed confidence among
U.S. consumers declined in July to a five-month low. The
Conference Board’s confidence index fell to 50.4 from a revised
54.3 in June, according to figures from the New York-based
private research group. The gauge was forecast to drop to 51,
according the median economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Benchmark Indexes  
 National benchmark indexes rose in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3 percent and
Germany’s DAX gained 0.2 percent, while France’s CAC 40 advanced
0.8 percent.  
 The  VStoxx Index , which measures the cost of protecting
against declines in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, dropped 1.5 percent
to 26.41, the lowest closing level in three months.  
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision yesterday
softened some of its proposed capital and liquidity rules while
introducing new restrictions on how much lenders can borrow in
order to rein in their risk-taking. The panel agreed to allow
certain assets, including minority stakes in other financial
firms, to count as capital.  
 The new rules follow last week’s European Union stress
tests that showed the majority of the region’s banks are
adequately capitalized. A Bank of America Corp. survey released
today showed the tests are seen positively by two-thirds of its
clients, with 28 percent expressing a negative opinion.  
 UBS, Deutsche Bank  
 UBS  rallied  11 percent to 17.46 Swiss francs, the biggest
gain since April 2009. Switzerland’s largest bank reported net
income of 2.01 billion francs ($1.91 billion), after a net loss
of 1.4 billion francs a year earlier. That beat the 1.12
billion-franc median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  
 Deutsche Bank advanced 4.5 percent to 52.64 euros, the
highest since April. Second-quarter net income increased 6.4
percent to 1.16 billion euros ($1.5 billion) as gains in retail
and transaction banking helped offset a decline in sales and
trading. That beat analysts’ estimate of 1.05 billion euros.  
 European banking shares rose 4.7 percent, the best
performance among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Credit
Agricole SA jumped 10 percent to 10.63 euros, while  Societe
Generale SE  surged 11 percent to 44.23 euros. Piraeus Bank SA
climbed 12 percent to 5.14 euros, the highest since May.  
 Tomkins Takeover  
 Tomkins, a British maker of transmissions and bath tubs,
soared 5.4 percent to 324 pence. The Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board and Onex, the nation’s biggest buyout firm,
agreed to buy the company for 2.89 billion pounds ($4.5 billion)
to add to their investments in the auto industry.  
 Fresenius Medical Care AG soared 4.9 percent to 43.15 euros
after the U.S. government released new rules on reimbursement
for operators of kidney dialysis centers. The fee paid to
dialysis centers will decline 2 percent to $250 to $260 per
treatment, which is a favorable outcome for the industry, said
 Arthur Henderson , an analyst for Jefferies & Co.  
 Deutsche Bank upgraded the shares of Fresenius Medial’s
parent company,  Fresenius SE , to “buy.” The stock climbed 4.3
percent to 55.02 euros.  
 Croda International Plc increased 8.4 percent to 1,272
pence, the highest closing level on record, as the British maker
of chemicals and ingredients for cosmetics said first-half
pretax profit doubled to 96.2 million pounds, ahead of an 82.4
million-pound estimate from JPMorgan Cazenove.  
 SAP Sinks  
 SAP AG slid 2.2 percent to 36.43 euros after the world’s
biggest maker of business-management software reported second-
quarter net income of 491 million euros. Analysts had forecast
profit at 525 million euros, the average of 15 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 InterContinental Hotels Group Plc  sank 7.4 percent to 1,110
pence after the billionaire Barclay brothers sold their 10
percent stake in the owner of the Holiday Inn brand for about
335 million pounds.  
 Groupe Danone SA  tumbled 4.2 percent to 44.36 euros. The
world’s biggest yogurt maker said profit margins weakened in the
first half, hurt by increased commodity expenses and the
introduction of a range of budget products.  
 Daimler AG dropped 4.2 percent to 41.34 euros even after
the world’s second-largest maker of luxury cars raised its 2010
operating profit forecast to 6 billion euros. The stock had
rallied 16 percent this year through yesterday.  
 “Investors are selling on good news,” said  Thomas Nagel ,
a trader at Equinet AG in Frankfurt. “Automobile shares had a
good run in the last few weeks and investors were expecting good
numbers from Daimler. Now that they have those numbers, they’re
selling on them to take profit.”  
 BP Plc lost 2.6 percent to 406 pence. The oil company
announced today the appointment of  Robert Dudley  as chief
executive officer from Oct. 1, who will succeed  Tony Hayward .
The company has pledged to accelerate asset sales to as much as
$30 billion and booked a pre-tax charge of $32.2 billion related
to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the biggest in U.S.
history.
