             Brazilian toll-road operators  Cia.
de Concessoes Rodoviarias  and  EcoRodovias Infraestrutura &
Logistica SA  were rated “buy” in new coverage at Deutsche Bank
AG, which said the stocks are two of the country’s few
“infrastructure plays.”  
 Rival  Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil SA  was initiated with a
“hold” rating because its shares have outperformed relative to
peers, analysts  Josh Milberg  and Diogo Miura wrote in a note to
clients dated yesterday.
