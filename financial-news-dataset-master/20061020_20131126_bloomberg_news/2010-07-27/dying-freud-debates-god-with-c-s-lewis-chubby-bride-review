             What could have happened if the
atheistic  Sigmund Freud  had met the newly religious British
author C.S. Lewis three weeks before the Viennese doctor’s death
in London on Sept. 23, 1939?  
 This is what Mark St. Germain ponders in his delightful
comedy-drama “Freud’s Last Session” at New York’s Little
Theatre. If it did not happen exactly like this, it should have.  
 Suggested by Harvard psychiatrist Armand M. Nicholi’s “The
Question of God,” the play is largely an intellectual dialogue,
though St. Germain adroitly brings in phone calls to Freud’s
analyst daughter Anna, Chamberlain’s declaration of war on the
radio, air-raid sirens and ominously buzzing airplanes.  
 Freud’s prosthetic jaw causes pain and even bleeding, with
Lewis compassionately but helplessly standing by. Even Freud’s
beloved dog avoids its master because of the smell from his
cancer-tortured mouth.  
 The two brilliant men engage in a brainy fencing match of
Olympic caliber. St. Germain tries to give equal voice to both,
but Freud, the wittily deflating skeptic, inevitably gets better
lines than Lewis, the earnestly hopeful Christian who would go
on to write “The Chronicles of Narnia.” It is sophisticated
comic versus restrained straight man.  
 Your Piccolo  
 Take Freud mocking Lewis’s chastity: “No sex before
marriage? It’s not only naive, it’s mindless cruelty. Like
sending a young man off to perform his first concerto with an
orchestra when the only time he’s ever played his piccolo was
alone in his room.”  
 Martin Rayner looks just right as Freud, has the
appropriate accent, suffers pain convincingly and delivers his
sallies with wonderful glints in the eye. Mark H. Dold, tall and
dignified, somewhat stiff with British reserve, is an
impassioned Lewis. There is a marvelous rapprochement when the
excruciated Freud is helped to the couch by Lewis, who sits
solicitously beside him like an analyst’s analyst.  
 Brian Prather’s expert recreation of the doctor’s study is
replete with the numerous statuettes and other antiquities that
Freud avidly collected. Suitable costumes are by Mark Mariani,
searching lighting by Clifton Taylor and the easefully animated
direction is by Tyler Marchant.

 ‘Bachelorette’  
 “Bachelorette,” by 29-year-old Leslye Headland, is an
entry in a series about the seven deadly sins, one play each,
still in progress. The subject is gluttony, though there is no
eating. Rather there is the free consumption of alcohol and
drugs from pot to cocaine, plus some medicinal drugs that young
Regan carries in her handbag.  
 On the eve of Becky’s wedding to a young millionaire, she
is envied by her unmarried friends who can’t believe a fat girl
beat them to the altar. Out of mischief, Regan, the prospective
maid of honor, has invited Gena and Katie, two pals and
troublemakers, to the hotel.  
 Eventually they are joined by Jeff and Joe, young men Regan
hardly knows. Gena, meanwhile, has brought coke for herself and
Katie, and whoever else will partake. Becky’s fiance has
thoughtfully stocked the tub with 15 bottles of expensive
Champagne.  
 All six characters are neatly individualized, and the talk
is witty, bawdy and sometimes touching. Underlying is a certain
rootlessness and irresponsibility, abundant references to
abortion and oral sex and a farcically torn wedding dress.  
 The acting is uniformly accomplished with Tracee Chimo
outstanding as the malicious and scary Regan. Andromache
Chalfant’s hotel suite, which gets reduced to a shambles, is
first-class, as are Emily Rebholz’s costumes.  
 Trip Cullman’s smart direction creates more movement than a
mere hotel room would seem to allow.
