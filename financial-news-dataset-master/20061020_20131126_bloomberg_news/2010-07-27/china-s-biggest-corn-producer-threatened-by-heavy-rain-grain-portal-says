             Heavy rainfall and cooler weather
may threaten the developing corn crop in China’s northeastern
Jilin province, the country’s top grower, according to portal
Grain.gov.cn.  
 The corn yield could face a “relatively significant”
threat if the rain and low temperatures continue into the
silking and pollination growth stages in Jilin, especially in
the low lands in the central to east areas, the portal said in
an e-mailed report today.  
 So far, the crop is growing at a normal pace after the so-
called tasseling stage, it said.
