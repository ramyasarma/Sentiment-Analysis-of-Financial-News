             DAB Bank AG , the German online
broker controlled by Italy’s UniCredit SpA, said profit climbed
26 percent in the second quarter helped by lower costs.  
 Net income rose to 6.91 million euros ($8.94 million) from
5.49 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Munich-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  
 Administrative costs at DAB Bank declined 6.4 percent to
27.7 million euros in the second quarter. The broker expects a
full-year pretax profit of “significantly more than 25 million
euros,” compared with 18.4 million euros in the first half.  
 Rival online broker  Comdirect Bank AG , which is  majority-
owned  by  Commerzbank AG , reported a 17 percent decline in profit
last week.
