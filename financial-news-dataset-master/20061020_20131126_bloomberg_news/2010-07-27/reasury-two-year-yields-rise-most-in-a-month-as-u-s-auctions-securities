             Treasury  two-year note yields rose
the most in more than a month as the government sold $38 billion
of the securities, the first of three note auctions this week
totaling $104 billion.  
 Government bonds fell even as the sale drew a record low
yield of 0.665 percent, below the 0.675 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Federal Reserve’s 18
primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
3.33, versus an average of 3.18 at the past 10 auctions. Stocks
fluctuated after a report showed a drop in consumer confidence.  
 “The sentiment at least for the next couple of days is that
we’ve gotten to a point where there could be a continuation of
higher yields because of supply and a nice turnaround in the
stock market” as companies reported earnings over the past two
weeks, said  Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading at
Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors.  
 Yields  on current two-year notes climbed as much as 6 basis
points, the biggest jump since June 10, to 0.64 percent before
trading at 0.63 percent at 4:28 p.m. in New York, according to
BGCantor Market Data. They touched a record low 0.5516 percent
on July 23. The 0.625 percent security due in June 2012 fell
3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99 31/32.  
 The 10-year  note yield  rose 5 basis points to 3.05 percent,
the highest level since July 15. Thirty-year  bond yields  rose 6
basis points to 4.08 percent and touched 4.09 percent, the
highest since July 14. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Two More Auctions  
 The Treasury will auction $37 billion in five-year notes
tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year debt on July 29.  
 “Given the amount of supply, there’s nothing much to rally
on right now,” said  John Spinello , chief technical strategist
in New York at Jefferies Group Inc., which as a primary dealer
is obligated to bid in Treasury sales. “The five-year has to
get more of a concession before the auction.”  
 Two-year notes drew a then-record yield of 0.738 percent at
the last auction, on June 22.  
 At today’s sale, indirect bidders, an investor class that
includes foreign central banks, purchased 32.8 percent of the
notes, compared with an average of 40.9 percent at the past 10
auctions. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 13.5
percent, versus 21.3 percent in June and an average of 15.3
percent at the past 10 auctions.  
 The size of today’s two-year sale was the smallest since
December 2008. This week’s total is the lowest monthly offering
of 2-, 5- and 7-year debt since June 2009.  
 Confidence Falls  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index rose 0.5 percent before
falling as much as 0.5 percent after the Conference Board said
its confidence index dropped in July to a five-month low, 50.4,
from a revised 54.3 in June. The forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a decline to 51.  
 The benchmark equities measure has gained 3.3 percent since
July 12, when Alcoa Inc. opened quarterly earnings-report
season.  
 “People were waiting to see if asset allocations would
cause some to sell out of stocks and jump into bonds, but we
haven’t seen that yet,” said  Michael Franzese , managing
director and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities
Inc. in New York.  
 The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 U.S. cities
increased 4.6 percent in May from a year earlier, the biggest
year-over-year gain since August 2006, the group said today in
New York. A Bloomberg survey forecast a 3.9 percent rise.  
 The gain came as a government tax temporarily underpinned
sales. A retreat in demand since it expired signals home prices
will slacken in coming months.  
 Beige Book  
 The Fed is scheduled to release its Beige Book regional
survey tomorrow, highlighting economic conditions as reported by
its 12 district banks. Last month’s survey showed that the U.S.
economy strengthened in all 12 regions in April and May, while
also noting growth in many was subdued.  
 European and Asian stocks rose today as data from around
the world pointed to economic recovery. The German consumer
sentiment index, based on a survey of 2,000 people, will rise to
3.9 next month from a revised 3.6 in July, the Nuremberg-based
market research company GfK said. Economists expect the index to
remain unchanged at this month’s initial reading of 3.5 points,
the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  
 The  gap  between yields on U.S. 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, was at 1.80 percentage points, from this
year’s high of 2.49 percentage points in January. The five-year
average is 2.13 percentage points.
