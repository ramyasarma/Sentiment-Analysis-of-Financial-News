             Copper dropped from the highest
level in more than 10 weeks, declining for the first day in
seven sessions, as gains were seen overdone amid lingering
concern that the global economic recovery may slow.  
 The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 1.1
percent to $7,070 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and traded at $7,075 at 3:26 p.m. in Shanghai. Zinc declined as
much as 1.1 percent to $1,932 a ton.  
 Shrinking inventories, a rally in equity markets and
declines in the dollar drove copper to $7,149.15 yesterday, the
highest intraday price since May 13. The metal had its first
quarterly loss since 2008 in the April-to-June period on concern
that the recovery was faltering.  
 “London copper is having a technical correction after
reaching the $7,100 resistance level,” said Ji Guoqin, an
analyst at Zhejiang Zhongda Futures Co., referring to a price
where sell positions are clustered.  
 China’s stocks dropped for the first time in seven days on
concern about rising credit risks at banks. Chinese banks may
struggle to recoup part of the loans they’ve lent for
infrastructure projects, according to a person with knowledge of
data collected by the China Banking Regulatory Commission. The
country this year restricted borrowing on concern money isn’t
being used for viable projects.  
 “Investors are cautious before they make sure China’s
economy is really on the uptrend,” Ji said. China is the
world’s largest metals consumer.  
 Norsk Hydro ASA said it expected global aluminum production,
excluding China, to exceed demand this year and most of the
capacity that has been curtailed is unlikely to restart. China
will be “broadly balanced in primary aluminum,” with a
“modest” surplus, the company said in a website presentation.  
 Copper for October delivery in Shanghai dropped 0.7 percent
to 55,190 yuan ($8,142) a ton at 2:52 p.m. local time. Aluminum
futures in London slid 0.2 percent to $2,053 a ton, while nickel
was little changed at $20,818 a ton. Lead fell 0.5 percent to
$2,005 a ton and tin climbed 0.5 percent to $19,500 a ton after
earlier rising to the highest level since September 2008.
