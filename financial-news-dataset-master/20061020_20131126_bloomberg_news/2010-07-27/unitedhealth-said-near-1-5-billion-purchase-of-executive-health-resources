             UnitedHealth Group Inc.  is nearing
an agreement to buy Executive Health Resources Inc., a medical
services firm backed by Abry Partners LLC, for about $1.5
billion, said three people with knowledge of the talks.  
 UnitedHealth would add the Newtown Square, Pennsylvania-
based company to its Ingenix database management and consulting
unit, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the talks are private. It may be an all-cash
transaction, one of the people said. An agreement could be days
away and may still fall apart, the people said.  
 UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. insurer by sales, is seeking
acquisitions to expand its health-services units, used by
doctors and employers to manage medical costs, Chief Executive
Officer  Stephen Hemsley  said July 20 on a conference call.
Executive Health, founded in 1997 by Chief Executive Officer
Robert Corrato, provides hospitals with teams of outside
physician advisers to improve regulatory compliance and
efficiency.  
 “Strategically, it makes sense for United,” said  Brian Wright , a Collins Stewart LLC analyst in New York, in a
telephone interview today. Facing declining profit growth in its
core insurance business, “they’ve got to look outside
those areas to produce meaningful growth.”  
 Shares Fall  
 The  shares  of UnitedHealth fell 69 cents, or 2.2 percent,
to $30.78 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Executive Health Resources is closely held.  
 Tyler Mason , a spokesman for Minnetonka, Minnesota-based
UnitedHealth, declined to comment. Michelle Bowman, of Executive
Health, and  Hilary Grove , a partner at Abry, didn’t immediately
respond to phone messages.  
 Executive Health Resources would be UnitedHealth’s fifth
acquisition in 2010 of a closely held company outside its
insurance unit, which accounted for about 75 percent of its
 earnings  last year, according to Bloomberg data.  
 The acquisitions, all announced without financial terms,
include  Picis  Inc., a medical-software maker;  QualityMetric 
Inc., a patient survey firm;  Wellness  Inc., which operates
workplace wellness clinics; and ChinaGate, a Shanghai-based
contract-researcher that conducts drug trials for pharmaceutical
companies.  
 UnitedHealth generated $357 million in earnings from
operations from its health-services units in this year’s second
quarter, about 20 percent of its total operating profit,
Hemsley, said on the company’s July 20 conference call. Hemsley
said he wants to double that percentage in the coming years.  
 WestView Capital Partners  
 WestView Capital Partners, a Boston-based private equity
firm, made a minority equity investment in Executive Health in
2006, according to a WestView statement at the time. It  sold  its
interest to Abry, also based in Boston, in 2007.  
 Executive Health hired UBS AG to find a buyer earlier this
year, the people said. MedAssets Inc., of Alpharetta, Georgia,
is among companies that bid on the business, two of the people
said.  Robert Borchert , a MedAssets spokesman, declined to
comment.
