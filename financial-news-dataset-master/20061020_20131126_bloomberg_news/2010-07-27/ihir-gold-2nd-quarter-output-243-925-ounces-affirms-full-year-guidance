             Lihir Gold Ltd ., which agreed to a
A$9.7 billion ($8.7 billion) takeover by Newcrest Mining Ltd.,
reported a 17 percent decline in second-quarter production as
heavy rain affected mining at its African project.  
 Output fell to 243,925 ounces in the three months ended
June 30, the Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea-based company said
today in a statement. That compares with 294,024 ounces a year
earlier.  
 Lihir  today restated its full-year output forecast of
between 1 million ounces and 1.1 million ounces. Gold prices hit
a record of $1,256.80 an ounce during the quarter.  
 “The second quarter of 2010 was a solid quarter for the
company, with production on track to meet full-year guidance,
and good progress achieved in the development of the expansion
projects at Lihir Island and in Côte d’Ivoire,” Managing
Director  Graeme Hunt  said in the statement.  
 Lihir  shares  declined 0.7 percent to A$4.06 at the 4:10 p.m.
Sydney time close on the Australian stock exchange.  
 Production at the company’s main mine on Lihir Island in
Papua New Guinea was 196,925 ounces, the statement said. That
compares with 219,436 ounces a year earlier. Production at
Bonikro in Côte d’Ivoire was down 48 percent to 22,510 ounces.  
 “The company is well placed to complete its merger with
Newcrest,” Hunt said in the statement. Shareholders are
scheduled to vote on the Newcrest deal on Aug. 23.  
 There’s a “possibility” of a rival offer, Hunt said later
on a conference call with reporters. “There’s no question about
that, but I’m not going to speculate on the probability of it
happening.”  
 Newcrest, buying Lihir to boost sales by more than half,
won the support of Lihir’s board for the deal after sweetening
its cash and stock bid. The combined group will be the world’s
fifth-biggest producer.
