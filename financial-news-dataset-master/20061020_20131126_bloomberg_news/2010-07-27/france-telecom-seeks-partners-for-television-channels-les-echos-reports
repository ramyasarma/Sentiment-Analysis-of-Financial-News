             France Telecom SA’s Orange unit is
seeking partners for its sports television channel Orange Sport
and cinema chain Orange Cinema Series,  Les Echos  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 The  phone company  is in talks with France’s professional
soccer league to form a partnership for the sports channel as it
seeks to reduce the annual 200 million-euro ($260 million) bill
for broadcast rights, the newspaper said.  
 Orange is also in talks to merge its cinema channel into a
50-50 joint venture with TPS Star, a unit of Vivendi SA’s Canal
Plus, according to Les Echos.
