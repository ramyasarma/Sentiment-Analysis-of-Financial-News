             Royal Dutch Shell Plc  opened its
Hazira liquefied natural gas terminal on India’s west coast to
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp., the first time it’s allowing a
third party to use the terminal, an official said.  
 The Iberica Knutsen, a 135,230 cubic-meter tanker, reached
Hazira yesterday with a cargo from Trinidad & Tobago, according
to transmissions from ships captured by AISLive on Bloomberg.  
 Shell will allow Gujarat State Petroleum to import a “few
cargoes,”  Deepak Mukarji , a Shell spokesman, said by mobile
phone today, without giving details on the duration of the
agreement.  
 Europe’s biggest oil company supplies LNG to buyers in
India through the Hazira terminal. Shell owns 74 percent of
Hazira LNG Pvt. and Total SA the rest.  
 The terminal has a capacity to receive 3.6 million metric
tons of LNG a year, Nitin Shukla, managing director of Hazira
LNG, said in September. The capacity can be expanded to 5
million tons a year, according to Hazira LNG’s website.
