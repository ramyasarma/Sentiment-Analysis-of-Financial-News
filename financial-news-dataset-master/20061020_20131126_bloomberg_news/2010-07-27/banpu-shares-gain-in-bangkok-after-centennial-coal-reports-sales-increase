             Banpu Pcl, a Thai coal miner and
power producer, rose to the highest level in three weeks in
Bangkok trading after its Australian affiliate Centennial Coal
Ltd. reported a 13 percent increase in fourth quarter sales.  
 The shares rose as much as 2.3 percent to 624 baht on the
Stock Exchange of Thailand as of 10:38 a.m. local time, headed
for their highest close since July 7.  
 Banpu on July 5 agreed to buy the 80 percent of Centennial
Coal it doesn’t own for A$2 billion ($1.8 billion). The
acquisition is pending approval from Australia’s Foreign
Investment Review Board. Banpu already owns a 20 percent stake
in Centennial Coal.
