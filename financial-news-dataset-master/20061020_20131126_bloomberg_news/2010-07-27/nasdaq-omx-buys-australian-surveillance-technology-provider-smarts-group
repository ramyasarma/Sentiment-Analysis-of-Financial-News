             Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. , which owns
the second-largest U.S. stock market and runs seven Nordic and
Baltic bourses, agreed to buy  Smarts Group , a provider of market
surveillance technology, as it seeks to diversify revenue.  
 The purchase of Sydney-based Smarts will likely close in
the third quarter, Nasdaq said in a statement today. Terms of
the transaction weren’t disclosed. Smarts is privately held and
sells its technology to exchanges, regulators and brokers.  
 “The acquisition of Smarts is a strategic fit with Nasdaq
OMX’s commercial technology business,” said  Anna Ewing ,
Nasdaq’s chief information officer. “Efficient surveillance
operations are imperative to ensure integrity in today’s
financial markets and Smarts allows us to capitalize on the
growing demand for surveillance technology products.”  
 Nasdaq, which reports second-quarter results later today,
is seeking to diversify its revenue and boost its technology
business as competition in trading grows in Europe and the U.S.
Demand for surveillance systems is growing as regulators step up
scrutiny of markets and pass new rules in the wake of the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression.
