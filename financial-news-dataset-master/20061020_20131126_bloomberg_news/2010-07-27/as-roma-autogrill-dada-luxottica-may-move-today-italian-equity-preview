             Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB  Index
gained for a second day, increasing 338.12, or 1.6 percent, to
21,158.08 in Milan.  
 The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.  
 Autogrill SpA  (AGL IM) declined for a second day, losing
18.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to 9.98 euros. Banca IMI lowered its
recommendation on the company’s stock to “add” from “buy.”  
 Banco Popolare SC  (BP IM) rose 9.25 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to 4.88 euros, pacing a rally in European bank shares. The Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision softened some of its proposed
capital and liquidity rules while introducing new restrictions
on how much lenders can borrow in order to rein in their risk-
taking.  
 “We think investors should applaud the proposed changes as
another step towards striking an appropriate balance between
increased capital & liquidity requirements and banks’ ability to
provide credit to the economy,” BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research wrote in a note on European banks.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA 
(ISP IM) rose 10 cents, or 4 percent, to 2.60 euros.  Mediobanca
SpA  (MB IM) surged 23 cents, or 3.4 percent, to 6.88 euros.  
 Buzzi Unicem SpA  (BZU IM) gained for a fifth day, rising 17
cents, or 2.1 percent, to 8.26 euros. Jefferies upgraded common
and savings shares of Italy’s second-biggest cement maker to
“hold” from “underperform.” The brokerage cited the recent
weakness of the stock. The savings shares gained 9.25 cents, or
2 percent, to 4.84 euros.  
 Cementir Holding SpA  (CEM IM) climbed 12 cents, or 5.2
percent, to 2.37 euros. Gruppo Banca Leonardo upgraded the
cement maker owned by Italy’s Caltagirone family to “buy” from

in the first half, compared with a profit during the same period
last year.  
 Luxottica Group SpA  (LUX IM) fell 50 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to 20.10 euros, ending a five-day increase. The world’s largest
eyewear maker had its price estimate increased at Nomura
International Plc, UBS AG and Exane BNP Paribas. UBS noted that
“management’s comments have been reassuring but no strong
catalyst has materialized during its quarterly conference
call.”  
 UniCredit SpA  (UCG IM) advanced 11.5 cents, or 5.6 percent,
to 2.16 euros, the highest in three months. Societe Generale SA

clients that “there could be some positive surprises on the
asset quality/loan-loss provisioning side.”
