             Equita Sim SpA placed 694,570 shares
of  Bwin Interactive Entertainment AG  for 35.30 euros each in
Vienna, according to terms obtained by Bloomberg News.  
 The price is toward the lower end of the 34.96 euro to
36.06 euro range Equita set in terms sent to clients yesterday
after markets closed. The book was oversubscribed, the terms
show.  
 Equita was the sole bookrunner, according to the terms. The
expiry of the lock-up period for the founders and shareholders
of Gioco Digitale SpA, which Bwin acquired in January, triggered
the sale. Equita sold 1.9 percent of the capital.  
 Bwin in September agreed to buy Gioco Digitale for up to 50
million euros ($65.1 million) in cash and a total consideration
of 2.3 million Bwin shares.  
 The Austrian online bookmaker  declined  1.3 percent to 36.31
euros at 1:26 p.m. in Vienna, after earlier falling as much as
2.7 percent to 35.80 euros.
