             Thai Union Frozen Products Pcl 
agreed to buy MW Brands, a European tuna canner, for about 680
million euros ($882 million) from Trilantic Capital Partners,
according to a person close to the situation.  
 Thai Union outbid canned tuna maker Bolton Group and
private equity funds such as  Blackstone Group LP  and Permira
Advisers LLP in an auction, which was run for two months by UBS
AG, according to the person, who declined to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  
 Thiraphong Chansiri , the president of Thai Union, had no
comment when reached by phone today. Representatives for
Trilantic weren’t immediately available to comment. Dow Jones
reported the sale yesterday.  
 Trilantic, the former private equity fund of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., was formed in 2009 in a management
buyout. Lehman bought MW Brands in 2006 from  H.J. Heinz Co.  for
425 million euros.
