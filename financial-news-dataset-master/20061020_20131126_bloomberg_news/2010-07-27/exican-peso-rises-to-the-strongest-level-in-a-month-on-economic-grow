             Mexico’s peso fell for the first
time in four days as consumer confidence in the U.S., the
nation’s largest trading partner, dropped to the lowest level in
five months.  
 The peso declined 0.1 percent to 12.6843 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 12.6714 yesterday. The decline pared
the peso’s gain against the dollar this year to 3.3 percent, the
second-best performer among the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind Japan’s yen.  
 “The consumer confidence number could have been an excuse
to take profits,” said  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , a currency
strategist with RBS Greenwich Capital Markets in Stamford,
Connecticut. “A lot of bullish sentiment on Mexico depends on
the U.S.”  
 Consumer confidence in the U.S. fell to 50.4 in July, below
the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S. buys about
80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  
 The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in 2024 rose six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.93 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell
0.65 centavo to 127.84 centavos per peso.
