             Credit-default swaps linked to
 Tomkins Plc  soared after Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
and  Onex Corp.  said they are borrowing $3 billion to fund the
buyout of the British auto-parts maker.  
 Contracts on Tomkins rose 51.5 basis points to 333, the
highest since April 2009, according to data provider CMA. Swaps
are used to speculate on a company’s ability to repay debt and
increase when perceptions of credit quality deteriorate.  
 Toronto-based Onex and Canada Pension are buying Tomkins
for 2.89 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) with each contributing
$1.1 billion from their own resources. Onex will fund its
portion from the Onex Partners III LP private equity unit while
Canada Pension Plan, the country’s second-biggest retirement
fund, will use existing cash.  
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Inc., Barclays
Capital, RBC Capital Markets and UBS AG arranged and underwrote
the debt financing for the buyout, according to a statement
today.  
 A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.
