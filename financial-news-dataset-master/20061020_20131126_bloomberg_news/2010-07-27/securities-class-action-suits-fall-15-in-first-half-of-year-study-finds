             Securities-fraud class-action
lawsuits fell 15 percent in the first half of the year from the
same period a year earlier, according to study by Stanford
University’s  Securities Class Action Clearinghouse  and
 Cornerstone Research .  
 “The securities fraud litigation wave stimulated by the
credit crisis now appears to be history,” Stanford Law School
Professor  Joseph Grundfest  said in a statement.  
 Eight of 71 U.S. cases filed in the first half of 2010
related to the credit crisis, the study showed. Such cases
totaled 53 in all of 2009 and 100 in 2008. Overall, the 71 total
cases so far in 2010 compared with 84 in each half of last year.  
 Contributing to the drop this year is the lack of Ponzi
scheme cases, according to the study. There were no securities-
fraud filings stemming from such frauds like the one for which
 Bernard L. Madoff  is serving a 150-year prison sentence. There
were 18 Ponzi-related class action filings last year.  
 All filings collected by the Clearinghouse and Cornerstone
are in U.S. federal courts.  
 New suits fell to the lowest semi-annual level since 2007.
The decline in new filings this year follows a trend that
started in 2009, when there were 169 new lawsuits, compared to
223 the year earlier.  
 Except for 2008 each year since 2005 has seen a decrease,
data from the Class Action Clearinghouse show.  
 ‘Real Shift’  
 “It could be we are having a real shift,” said  John
Gould , a  senior vice president  at Cornerstone. “Plaintiffs will
say it’s because court rulings have made it harder to file
cases. Defendants will say it’s because there’s less fraud going
on.”  
 He attributed the decrease in case filings in part to
decreased stock market volatility.  
 Four of the 71 new cases represented two-thirds of the
disclosed losses, according to the study, which didn’t identify
the cases.  
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued in April by investors for
failing to disclose information about its true financial
condition, including that it had received a notice from the
Securities and Exchange Commission about an investigation into a
mortgage investment, according to the Class Action
Clearinghouse.  
 The company fell 13 percent in a day after being sued by
the SEC in April, according to a case summary on the
clearinghouse’s  website . On July 15, Goldman announced it agreed
to settle the SEC’s lawsuit for $550 million.
