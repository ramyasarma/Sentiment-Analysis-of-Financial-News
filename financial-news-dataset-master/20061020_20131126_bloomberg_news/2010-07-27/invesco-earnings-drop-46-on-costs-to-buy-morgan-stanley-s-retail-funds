             Invesco Ltd .’s second-quarter
earnings declined 46 percent because of costs from its $1.37
billion agreement to buy  Morgan Stanley’s  retail-funds business.  
 Net income in the three months ended June 30 fell to $40.8
million, or 9 cents a share, from $75.7 million, or 18 cents, a
year earlier, Atlanta-based Invesco said in a statement today.
Charges related to the acquisition decreased earnings by 14
cents a share. Excluding that and other items, earnings of 27
cents a share beat the  average  estimate of 26 cents in a
Bloomberg  survey  of 15 analysts.  
 The purchase of the Morgan Stanley business, which included
the Van Kampen family of funds, was completed two months into
the quarter and boosted operating profit by $18.6 million to
$188.7 million. Fees collected for managing investments rose 27
percent to $653 million, including $36.3 million from the
acquired funds.  
 “People should expect a positive impact from the
acquisition going forward,”  Loren M. Starr , Invesco’s chief
financial officer, said in an interview.  
 Invesco declined 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19.46 at
4:25 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
company has fallen 17 percent this year, compared with the 7.4
percent decline by Standard & Poor’s 15-company  index  for asset
managers and custody banks.  
 Additional Charges  
 Starr said Invesco, which reported an after-tax
acquisition-related charge of $64.5 million in the quarter,
expects to incur about $69 million in additional costs in the
second half of this year.  
 The Morgan Stanley deal added $114.6 billion in assets,
helping to increase the funds Invesco manages by 30 percent to
$557.7 billion as of June 30. Investors added $13.9 billion more
than they withdrew during the quarter. Market losses decreased
assets by $24.2 billion in the period.  
 “Their operating results were generally in line with what
I expected, and flows continue to show progress,”  Michael Kim ,
an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York, said
in an interview.  
 The acquisition and net inflows helped boost revenue 25
percent from last year to $589 million, while helping to
increase total expenses by 17 percent to $400.3 million.
Employee compensation rose 15 percent to $260.1 million with the
addition of 580 people.
