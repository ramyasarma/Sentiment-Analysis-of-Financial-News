             Brazil sold $750 million of bonds
after boosting the size of its second international offering
this year by 50 percent.  
 The bonds due in 2021 yield 4.547 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Bank AG  and Bank of  America
Corp.  arranged the transaction, the person said. The sale is a
re-opening of 4.875 percent notes it initially sold in April.  
 Brazil tapped overseas markets after growing demand for
developing-nation assets drove yields on the 2021 securities to
the lowest level since they were issued. The yield on the bonds
earlier fell to 4.40 percent in New York, down from 5 percent on
April 15, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co.
