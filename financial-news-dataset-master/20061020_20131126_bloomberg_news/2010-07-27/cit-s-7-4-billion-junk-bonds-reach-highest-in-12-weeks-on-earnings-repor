             CIT Group Inc.’s $7.4 billion of 7
percent notes rose to the highest in 12 weeks after the
commercial lender reported second-quarter profit that exceeded
analyst estimates.  
 The notes due in 2017 climbed 0.75 cent to 95 cents on the
dollar as of 9:05 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  
 The notes are rated B3 by Moody’s Investors Service and B+
by Standard & Poor’s. High-yield, high-risk debt is rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s and lower than BBB- by S&P.
