             Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi  said interested investors submitted bids for
distressed Nigerian lenders ahead of a July 31 deadline.  
 “I can confirm that there are parties interested in
combining with each and every one of the banks,” Sanusi told
reporters today in the capital, Abuja. “The process is being
driven by the boards of directors of the banks.”  
 Last year the central bank had to rescue 10 of Nigeria’s
lenders by injecting 620 billion naira ($4.1 billion) of capital
into them. Sanusi fired the chief executive officers of eight of
the West African nation’s lenders, called for interested parties
to bid for stakes in the banks and created the Asset Management
Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon, which will buy bad debts. Foreign
and local investors from  First Bank of Nigeria Plc  to South
Africa’s  Standard Bank Group Ltd.  and  FirstRand Ltd.  registered
to investigate buying shares.  
 “This is a confidential process,”  Erik Larsen , a
spokesman for Standard Bank, said today. The lender, which
already has operations in Nigeria, doesn’t think it is
“appropriate to comment” at this stage, according to Larsen.
