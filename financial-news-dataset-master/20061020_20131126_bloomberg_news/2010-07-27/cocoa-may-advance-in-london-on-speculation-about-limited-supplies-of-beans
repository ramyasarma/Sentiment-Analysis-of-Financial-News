             Cocoa, little changed in London
today, may gain on speculation that supplies of the chocolate
ingredient might be limited before harvesting starts.  
 “Buying pressure could continue in the next few weeks, as
the physical availability is not there,”  Eugen Weinberg , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by phone.  
 Cocoa supply is often tighter before harvests begin in
October in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world’s two largest
growers,  Laurent Pipitone , chief statistician at the
International Cocoa Organization, said yesterday. Production was
below demand in three of the past four years, curbing supplies
of the beans, he said.  
 Cocoa for September delivery rose 4 pounds, or 0.2 percent,
to 2,283 pounds ($3,530) a metric ton on the Liffe exchange at
10:34 a.m. local time, paring a climb of as much as 0.8 percent.
London-traded cocoa has gained 26 percent in the past year,
helped by forecasts for higher demand as the global economy
recovers.  
 On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, cocoa for September
delivery fell 0.1 percent to $2,971 a ton.  
 White, or refined, sugar for October delivery rose $7.80,
or 1.4 percent, to $573.90 a ton on Liffe. Robusta coffee for
September delivery fell $9, or 0.5 percent, to $1,714 a ton.
