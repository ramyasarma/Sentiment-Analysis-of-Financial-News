             South African Mines Minister  Susan Shabangu  will make a decision on disputed prospecting rights at
Sishen, Africa’s largest iron ore mine, “within the next
week,” the Department of Mineral Resources said.  
 “The department received a request from  Kumba Iron Ore
Ltd.  to reconsider the granting decision,”  Sandile Nogxina ,
director general of the department, said in a text message
today. The minister “will make her decision known within the
next week.”  
 Kumba is challenging the decision to award 21.4 percent of
the prospecting rights at Sishen to Imperial Crown Trading Ltd.,
a company whose only asset is that right. Kumba, a unit of  Anglo
American Plc , owns the rest of the mine’s rights. The government
said on March 22 it would review the award.  
 The stake was owned by  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. 
until it reverted to the state after the steelmaker failed to
renew the rights in time, according to the Department of Mineral
Resources. The government rejected Kumba’s application for the
rights, instead awarding them to Imperial, the department said
on March 18.
