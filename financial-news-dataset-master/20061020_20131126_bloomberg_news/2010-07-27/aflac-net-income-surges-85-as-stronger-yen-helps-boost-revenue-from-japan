             Aflac Inc. , the world’s largest
seller of supplemental health insurance, said second-quarter
profit surged 85 percent as a stronger yen magnified revenue
from Japan and investment losses narrowed.  
 Net income increased to $581 million, or $1.23 a share,
from $314 million, or 67 cents, in the same period a year
earlier, the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer said today in a
statement. Realized investment losses narrowed to $58 million
from $249 million a year earlier.  
 Aflac, which gets most of its  revenue  from policies
supplementing work and government health insurance in Japan, is
counting on earnings there to support capital as the recession
pressures  investments  backing policies. The yen strengthened
against the dollar on average in the second quarter to 92.05
from 97.53 in the same period a year earlier, Aflac said.  
 “Aflac Japan’s operations have remained strong while
producing significant sales growth,” Chief Executive Officer
 Dan Amos  said in the statement. “We are in a very good position
to meet our earnings objectives” for 2010 of a 9 percent to 12
percent increase in operating profit.  
 Sales of new policies in Japan rose 13 percent to 33.9
billion yen ($368 million) on a 42 percent surge in life
policies, Aflac said. A stronger yen boosted operating earnings
by 2 cents a share in the quarter, Aflac said.  
 Aflac Climbs  
 Aflac, which reported results after the close of regular
trading, has climbed about 10 percent this year, as has the 24-
company  KBW Insurance Index . The company fell 33 cents to $50.71
at 4:07 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 Shareholders’ equity, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, improved to $10 billion as of June 30 from $9
billion at the end of March on unrealized gains on securities
and derivatives.  
 Operating income, which excludes some investment results,
was $1.35 a share, beating the $1.33 average  estimate  of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The company said last month it would take a $67 million
charge in the second quarter after dumping Greek sovereign bonds
at a loss to reduce the risk of further writedowns.
