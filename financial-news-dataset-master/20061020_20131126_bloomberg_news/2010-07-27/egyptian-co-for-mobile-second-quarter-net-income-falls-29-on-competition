             Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services ,
the company that was at the center of a dispute between Orascom
Telecom Holding SAE and France Telecom SA, said second-quarter
net income fell 29 percent because of increased competition.  
 The company, which operates under the Mobinil brand, posted
earnings after taxes and minority interests of 381 million
Egyptian pounds ($66.8 million), compared with 536 million
pounds a year earlier, according to a statement today.  
 “During the first half of 2010, Mobinil faced a massive
intensification of the regulatory and competitive pressures,”
Chief Executive Officer  Hassan Kabbani  said in the statement.
“We still expect those adverse conditions to continue in the
foreseeable future.”  
 France Telecom  and  Orascom Telecom  agreed April 15 to end a
2 1/2-year-old legal dispute about their joint ownership of
Mobinil. The settlement put an end to the Paris-based company’s
attempt to edge Cairo-based Orascom out of the holding company
and buy out minority shareholders of Mobinil.  
 Mobinil’s operating revenue fell to 2.53 billion Egyptian
pounds in the quarter from 2.73 billion pounds as it added
26,000 customers. Mobinil said it now has 26.1 million
subscribers.  
 Blended average revenue per user declined 22 percent to 32
pounds because of “aggressive competition and price war
impact,” the company said.  
 Mobinil’s quarterly profit was forecast at 460 million
pounds, the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Mobinil rose 0.4 percent today to 162.67 pounds in Cairo
trading.
