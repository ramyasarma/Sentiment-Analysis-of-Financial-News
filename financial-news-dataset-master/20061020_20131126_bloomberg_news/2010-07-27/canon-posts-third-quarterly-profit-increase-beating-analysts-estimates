             Canon Inc. , the world’s largest
camera maker, posted its third straight quarterly profit
increase, beating analysts’ estimates as the economic recovery
boosted demand for single-lens reflex cameras and laser printers.  
 Net income more than quadrupled to 67.6 billion yen ($779
million) in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said today. That exceeded the 58 billion
yen median of three analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Canon raised its forecast for annual camera sales after
shipments rose 9 percent last quarter. Growth across the
company’s businesses, including office equipment, will extend
into the second half as China and emerging markets lead the
global economic recovery, it said.  
 “Sales of cameras and printers have recovered
significantly from last year,”  Tetsuya Wadaki , a Tokyo-based
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said before the results were
announced. “Whether the robust businesses will remain strong
enough to cover any possible impact from changes in the euro
exchange rate remains to be seen.”  
 Operating  profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, more than doubled to 113.4 billion yen
in the quarter as revenue increased 22 percent.  
 Canon slipped 0.4 percent to close at 3,515 yen in Tokyo
 trading  before the earnings announcement, extending the loss
this year to 10 percent, in line with the benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average’s decline for the period.  
 Camera Sales Forecast  
 Profit from camera  operations , Canon’s second-biggest
business, increased 72 percent to 66.9 billion yen. Canon raised
its forecast for annual camera sales to 26.5 million units, from
its April projection of 25.9 million.  
 Income at the office-equipment division, Canon’s biggest by
sales last year, almost doubled to 83.8 billion yen in the
quarter as revenue gained 31 percent.  
 Global shipments of digital cameras rose 21 percent to 641
billion yen in the first five months of 2010 from a year earlier,
according to  Camera & Imaging Products Association.  Worldwide
hardcopy peripherals shipments rose 7 percent to $13.8 billion
in the quarter ended March 31 from a year earlier, the first
gain since early 2008, researcher IDC said in May.  
 Canon, which generated 78 percent of sales outside Japan
last year, forecast the dollar will average 90 yen and the euro
110 yen in the second half, it said. That compares with the 90
yen and 125 yen respectively it estimated in April.  
 ‘Temporary’ Yen Strength  
 “The yen has been bought up temporarily as a refuge, so
the rates will probably be corrected when the move stops,”
 Toshizo Tanaka , Canon executive vice president, told reporters
in Tokyo.  
 The world’s second-largest printer maker loses about 6.8
billion yen of annual operating profit for every 1 yen decline
in the value of the dollar against the Japanese currency and 4.1
billion yen of profit for each 1 yen the euro weakens, the
company said in April.  
 Canon kept unchanged its April  forecast  for an 82 percent
increase in annual net income to 240 billion yen, a 66 percent
increase in annual operating profit to 360 billion yen and for a
17 percent gain in annual sales to 3.75 trillion yen.
