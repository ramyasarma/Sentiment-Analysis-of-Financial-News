             Corporate bond investors didn’t ask
the Bank of England to buy a single bond under its debt purchase
program for the first time since March, signaling sentiment has
improved, according to Evolution Securities Ltd.’s  Gary Jenkins .  
 None of the 355 billion pounds ($552 million) of securities
the BOE said that it would purchase under its twice-weekly
program was tendered today. The central bank started the
facility last year to offset the effects of the deepest
financial crisis since the 1930s.  
 Credit markets have rallied since May when concern that
governments would have trouble raising cash while trimming their
budget deficits prompted investors to tender a record 507
million pounds of debt on June 8. Spain’s auction last week of 6
billion euros ($7.8 billion) of treasury bills and a bank stress
test that showed 84 of 91 firms passed helped build confidence,
Jenkins said in a note to clients.  
 “No doubt the positive earnings season and the improvement
in economic data have helped to turn sentiment, but one can’t
help thinking that the tipping point was the Spanish bond
auctions,” wrote Jenkins, head of credit research at Evolution
in London. “The positive reaction to the stress tests plus the
relaxation of the Basel 3 proposals are continuing the recent
positive trend.”
