             The euro won’t sustain its advance
against the dollar beyond the summer as concern resurfaces that
some European nations aren’t able to repay their debts,
according to Standard Bank Plc.  
 “Make the most of it while it lasts, because a euro-dollar
rally after the summer looks unlikely,”  Steve Barrow , head of
Group-of-10 foreign-exchange research in London, wrote in a
report today. “We don’t see the U.S. economy imploding and, for
another, we feel that the euro-zone debt crisis could come back
to bite the euro again.”  
 The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.2972 as of 10:35 a.m. in
London. It strengthened to $1.3029 on July 20, the strongest
level since May 10.
