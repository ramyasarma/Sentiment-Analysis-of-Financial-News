             U.S. Steel Corp. , the country’s
largest producer of the metal, posted an unexpected second-
quarter loss after revaluing a $1.4 billion loan made to a
European unit.  
 The  net loss  narrowed to $25 million, or 17 cents a share,
from $392 million, or $2.92, a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-
based company said today in a statement. Profit excluding some
one-time items was 44 cents a share, missing the 66-cent  average
estimate  of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales more than
doubled to $4.68 billion.  
 U.S. Steel, led by Chief Executive Officer  John Surma , had
a $96 million foreign-currency loss in the quarter. The average
value of the euro in the period was 9.4 percent less than in the
first three months of the year.  
 U.S. Steel  dropped  $3.45, or 7.1 percent, to $45.44 at
10:50 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading.  The shares  gained
17 percent this year through yesterday.  
 Operating profit was $198 million, compared with a $465
million operating loss a year earlier. U.S. Steel said third-
quarter operating income will be less than in the second quarter
as shipments and production of flat-rolled steel decline.  
 “Outlook was weak with a forecast breakeven result in the
domestic steel division,”  Michelle Applebaum , who runs a
Chicago-based Michelle Applebaum Research, wrote in a note.  
 Steel Shipments  
 U.S. Steel’s total steel shipments were 5.88 million tons,
double the level a year earlier and 8.8 percent more than in the
first quarter.  
 The average second-quarter price of hot-rolled steel coil,
a benchmark product used in cars and buildings, was $635 a short
ton in the U.S., 71 percent more than a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Metal Bulletin.  
 The company has benefitted from having its own iron-ore
supplies, limiting the impact on margins of higher raw-material
costs. The spot price of iron ore in China averaged $159 a
metric ton in the second quarter, more than double the level a
year earlier, according to Steel Business Briefing data.
