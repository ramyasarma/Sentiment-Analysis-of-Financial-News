             The number of  jobseekers  in France
declined in June, a sign the nation’s economic recovery prompted
companies to hire.  
 The  number of unemployed  actively looking for work fell by
8,600 last month, a drop of 0.3 percent, the labor and finance
ministries said in a statement today in Paris. The total number
of jobseekers was 2.7 million, still the highest since May 2005.  
 The decline is the second this year, after a drop of 6,600
in March, and reflects a strengthening rebound from France’s
worst recession since World War II. Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said that the figures confirm a “stabilization” of the
labor market, though economists are looking for a further drop
before saying that the peak in claims has been passed.  
 “This corresponds with the trend, which is for moderation
in unemployment,” said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP
Paribas in Paris. “It will take a few more months of declines
before the improvement is confirmed.”  
 Jobless claims have been increasing since March 2008, when
the total was as low as 1.9 million. Lagarde has repeatedly
predicted that job growth will return to France in the second
half of 2010.  
 PSA Peugeot Citroen , Europe’s second-biggest carmaker, has
said in recent weeks that it is  adding night shifts  at plants
across France and elsewhere to meet renewed demand for its cars.
