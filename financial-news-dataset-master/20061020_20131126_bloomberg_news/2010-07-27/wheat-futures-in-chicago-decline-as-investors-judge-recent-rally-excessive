             Wheat jumped in Paris and Chicago,
rebounding from a decline after Russia said it may again cut
its outlook for this year’s grain harvest because of a crop-
damaging drought.  
 September-delivery wheat rose 1.5 percent to $5.8875 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time,
after falling 1.2 percent earlier today. Milling wheat for
November delivery gained as much as 3.8 percent to 184.25 euros
($240.10) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in the French capital.  
 The Russian grain harvest may be less than 80 million
tons, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said today, less
than the current estimate for 85 million tons. The crop may
fall below 70 million tons as yields decline because of the
worst drought in at least a decade, researcher SovEcon said.  
 “Russia remains the focus of all attention,” Bourges,
France-based farm adviser  Offre et Demande Agricole  said on its
website today. “The impact of the drought on production is
still uncertain and the wheat market could still hold some
upward surprises in reserve.”  
 Paris milling wheat was at 180.75 euros in recent trading,
after falling as much as 1.8 percent earlier. The November
contract has risen 24 percent in Paris this month, while
Chicago wheat has climbed 25 percent.  
 Wheat prices in the European part of Russia rose 15
percent to 4,850 rubles ($160.40) a ton by July 23 from a week
ago on concern that drought may curb supply, SovEcon said on its
website. Russia was the third-largest grower in the 2009-10
season, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 Corn for December delivery rose 1.3 percent to $3.8275 a
bushel in Chicago.  
 November-delivery soybeans rose 0.6 percent to $9.715 a
bushel.
