             Japan’s banks are turning to longer-
dated debt and the swap market to capture profits as yields on
their preferred five-year securities languish near a seven-year
low, according to Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co.  
 Lenders are buying 10-year government bonds and making
fixed payments on interest-rate swaps in exchange for six-month
Libor, the London interbank offered rate, said  Tokuyoshi Takano ,
a financial-derivatives manager in Tokyo at Mitsui Sumitomo. The
trade provides a 0.38 percent yield, compared to 0.35 percent on
five-year notes, according to Bloomberg data.  
 “At a time of low interest rates like this, investors
would be better off holding  10-year bonds  using asset swaps,
rather than simply purchasing five-year debt,” Takano said.
“Such trades are prompting banks to invest in 10-year bonds,
helping push down yields.”  
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell half a
basis point to 1.055 percent as of 1:38 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The 10-year swap  rate  was 1.12005 percent and six-month yen
Libor was set at 0.442 percent yesterday.  
 Five-year yields dropped to 0.32 percent on July 1, the
lowest level since August 2003.  
 The  difference  between 5- and 10-year yields narrowed to
71 basis points today, the tightest level since November. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
