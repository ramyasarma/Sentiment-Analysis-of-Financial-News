             South Korean Foreign Minister  Yu Myung Hwan  came under fire from the opposition after he was
quoted as saying young people who criticize the government’s
North Korea policies should go and live there.  
 Yu told South Korean reporters on July 24 in Hanoi that
leftist attitudes among the nation’s youth would make it
difficult to sustain the country, local media, including
 MoneyToday , reported yesterday. Yu was in the Vietnamese capital
to attend the Asean Regional Forum.  
 Yu also criticized young people for voting for the
Democratic Party in last month’s local elections, when the
ruling Grand National Party suffered a surprise defeat.  
 “Minister Yu Myung Hwan should issue a public apology and
resign immediately,” the  Democratic Party  said yesterday on its
website. “Is he suggesting that young voters who support the
opposition party have no right to live in this country?”  
 Foreign ministry spokesman Kim Young Sun told reporters
yesterday that Yu had no political motive in making his comments,
without elaborating.  
 President  Lee Myung Bak  has adopted a more hostile approach
to dealing with North Korea, rejecting the past two
administrations’ “Sunshine Policy” of engaging the communist
country. Lee banned trade with North Korea after his country
accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships on March 26,
killing 46 sailors.
