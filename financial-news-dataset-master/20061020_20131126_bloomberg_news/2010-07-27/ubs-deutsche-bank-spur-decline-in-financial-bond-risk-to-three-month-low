             The cost of insuring against losses
on financial bonds fell to the lowest in three months after  UBS
AG  and  Deutsche Bank AG  posted earnings that beat analyst
estimates and regulators softened proposed capital rules.  
 The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 European banks and insurers fell as
much as 9 basis points to 108.5 and was trading at 110 at 3:30
p.m., the lowest since April 21, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. The gauge has rallied 23 basis points since bank stress
tests were released July 23.  
 UBS, the largest Swiss lender, and Deutsche Bank said they
were confident about the future with Germany’s biggest lender
forecasting a doubling of pretax profit by 2011. Investor
confidence was buoyed after the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision said banks can count deferred tax assets and
minority stakes in other financial firms as capital.  
 “The market now is stress relieved,” said  Greg Venizelos ,
a London-based credit strategist at BNP Paribas SA. “The
‘uncertainty’ risk premium is now being unwound.”  
 Default swaps on UBS fell 7.5 basis points to 95 and
Deutsche Bank declined 13 to 91.5, according to data provider
CMA. Contracts on Allied Irish Banks Plc dropped 84.5 basis
points to 373, Banco Comercial Portugues SA decreased 35.5 to
294.5 and Commerzbank AG fell 10.5 to 85.  
 The difference between Markit’s financial gauge and the
broader European corporate benchmark also shrank to the
narrowest since March. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings dropped 2 basis points
to 102.75, JPMorgan prices show.  
 Crossover Index  
 Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-
default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit
ratings decreased 3 basis points to 474, the lowest level since
May 13.  
 Credit indexes pared their decline after the U.S.
Conference Board’s confidence index fell more than forecast in
July to a five-month low.  
 Swaps insuring BP Plc debt for five years fell 15.5 basis
points to 321.5, CMA prices show. BP’s one-year protection
exceeded five-year default swaps by the least since June 8 as
the company appointed U.S.-born Robert Dudley as chief executive
officer and pledged to accelerate asset sales to as much as $30
billion after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill led to a record loss.  
 Sovereign Swaps  
 The cost of insuring against losses on sovereign debt also
declined. Swaps on Greek government debt dropped 48.5 basis
points to 690, contracts on Spain declined 15.5 to 174, Italy
dropped 19.5 to 129.5, Portugal fell 30.5 to 221, and Ireland
fell 27.5 to 204.  
 Swaps on Tomkins Plc surged after Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board and buyout firm Onex Corp. said they’re
borrowing $3 billion to fund the takeover of the British auto-
parts maker. Contracts rose 63.5 basis points to 345, the
highest level since April 2009.  
 Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a credit-default swap contract protecting 10 million euros ($13
million) of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
1,000 euros a year.
