             Singapore Airlines Ltd. , the world’s
second-largest carrier by market value, rose the most in more
than two weeks after posting better-than-estimated first-quarter
 profit  and saying a recovery in demand will continue.  
 The carrier climbed 1.8 percent to S$15.02 in the city-
state. The airline reported a net income of  S$252.5 million 
($185 million) after the market closed yesterday, beating the
S$162.4 million average of four analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Singapore Air boosted  passenger numbers  5.5 percent in the
quarter as air travel rebounds from the worst recession in more
than six decades. Advance bookings indicated that the recovery
in travel and yields, or the average fare a passenger pays to
fly one kilometer, will hold up for the rest of the year, the
airline said.  
 “Their guidance reaffirms our positive view on passenger
demand,” said  Kelvin Lau , an analyst at Daiwa Institute of
Research in Hong Kong. “The result was better than expected.  
 Lau also raised his forecast for the carrier’s net income
in the year ending March to S$1.9 billion from S$1.5 billion.
The carrier had a net income of S$216 million last year, the
lowest in at least two decades.  
 The airline flew 4 million passengers in the first quarter,
compared with 3.8 million a year earlier, according to the
statement. It filled 78.4 percent of seats in the quarter,
compared with 71.6 percent a year earlier.  
 Passenger yields rose to 11.7 Singapore cents in the three
months, compared with 10.2 cents a year earlier. The airline
filled 65 percent of its cargo space, compared with 60.6 percent
a year earlier.  
 Profit was also bolstered by a smaller fuel-hedging loss of
S$78 million, compared with S$287 million a year earlier,
 Singapore Air  said in the statement.
