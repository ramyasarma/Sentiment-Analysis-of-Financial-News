 Total sales were 1.041 million metric tons in the three
months ended June 30, up from 1.038 million tons a year earlier,
Sydney-based Whitehaven said in a statement released on the

 Export thermal coal sales prices have been fixed at about
$98 a ton for the year started April 1, from $70 a ton last year,
Whitehaven said.  Whitehaven ’s stock rose 0.4 percent to A$5.50
at the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney trading.
