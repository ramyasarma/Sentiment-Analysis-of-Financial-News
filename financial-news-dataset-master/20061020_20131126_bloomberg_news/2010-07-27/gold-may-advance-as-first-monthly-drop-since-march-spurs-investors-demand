             Gold, little changed in New York,
may gain on speculation that the first monthly drop in prices
since March will spur physical demand. Platinum climbed to a
four-week high.  
 Bullion is down 4.6 percent this month and futures
yesterday dropped as low as $1,182.40 an ounce. They fell to an
eight-week low of $1,175.10 on July 20. Holdings in the world’s
biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund yesterday slid to the
lowest level since June 9.  
 “For the past two or three weeks, we’ve seen good buying
in the physical market” at current prices, said  Walter de Wet ,
an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in London. Still, “if gold
doesn’t move higher, physical buyers will probably adjust their
expectations lower.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery slipped $1.70, or 0.1
percent, to $1,185.30 an ounce at 8:22 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.1 percent
lower at $1,182.50.  
 Bullion was little changed at $1,184 an ounce in the
morning “fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to
sell output, from $1,183.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  
 Futures are up 8.4 percent this year and set a record
$1,266.50 an ounce on June 21 as investors sought to protect
their wealth against the European debt crisis and on concern
that the global economy may slow. Most European banks passed
stress tests designed to show their ability to withstand a
financial crisis, lenders and regulators said July 23.  
 ‘Bumpy’ Prices  
 “Gold prices are likely to remain bumpy” in coming weeks,
 Tobias Merath , head of commodity research at Credit Suisse Group
AG, said by phone. While some bullion holders are selling the
metal to lock in gains, “at the same time, more longer-term-
orientated investors are now slowly returning to the market,”
he said.  
 Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETF backed by
bullion, declined 0.3 metric ton to 1,301.74 tons yesterday,
according to the company’s website.  
 Global bullion ETF holdings are up by 219,000 ounces so far
this month, heading for the smallest gain since February, after
climbing 4.77 million ounces in May, UBS AG analyst  Edel Tully 
said today in an e-mailed report. Assets expanded by 273.8 tons
(8.8 million ounces) in the second quarter, the second-largest
quarterly inflow ever, the World Gold Council said in a report
today.  
 “Over the course of last week, ETF investors liquidated
397,000 ounces, marking the most severe weekly selloff since the
beginning of January,” Tully said. “Current sentiment toward
gold is decidedly unsure and cautious.”  
 Silver for September delivery in New York added 0.1 percent
to $18.22 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery gained 0.5
percent to $1,564 an ounce, the highest price since June 29.
Palladium for September delivery was 0.5 percent higher at
$477.50 an ounce.
