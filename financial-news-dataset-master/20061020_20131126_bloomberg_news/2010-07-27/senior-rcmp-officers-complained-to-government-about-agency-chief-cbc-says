             Senior officers with the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, the country’s main law enforcement
agency, have complained to the government about the head of the
force, the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  reported.  
 Commission  William Elliot  is alleged to have been verbally
abusive and insulting, the CBC said, citing the complainants.
Possibly as many as 10 RCMP members have registered their
concerns including some deputy commissioners.  
 Elliott assumed the civilian role as head of the RCMP in
July, 2007, according to the CBC. The Prime Minister’s Office
declined to comment, the CBC reported. The RCMP’s press office
in Ottawa didn’t immediately return a telephone call from
Bloomberg News seeking comment.
