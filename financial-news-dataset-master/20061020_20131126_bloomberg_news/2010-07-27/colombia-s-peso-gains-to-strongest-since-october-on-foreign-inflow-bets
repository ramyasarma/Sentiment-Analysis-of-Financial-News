             Colombia’s peso rose to its
strongest level since October on bets foreign investment flows
will continue to push gains in the local currency.  
 The peso advanced 0.5 percent to 1,849.90 per U.S. dollar
at 2:03 p.m. New York time, from 1,858.90 yesterday. That’s the
strongest level on a closing basis since Oct. 16. The peso is up
10.5 percent this year, the best performance among world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 The peso fell 0.3 percent on July 23, the only decline in
the last seven trading days, on bets the central bank would
announce in its monetary policy meeting that it would buy
dollars in the spot market to ease gains in the local currency.  
 “People were expecting the central bank to announce that
it would intervene in the market, and since that didn’t happen,
investors are buying pesos on bets it will continue to
strengthen,” said  Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota
SA, Colombia’s second-biggest bank.  
 Central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe  told reporters after
the July 23 meeting that Banco de la Republica “has never ruled
out intervening in the market again.” The bank purchased $20
million a day between March 3 and June 30 to curb a rally policy
makers said left the peso “misaligned.”  
 Foreign direct investment flows as well as increased
foreign investment in Colombian financial assets and higher
inflows from local companies taking loans abroad are driving
gains in the peso, according to Perez.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.68
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price fell 0.595 centavo to 122.625 centavos per peso.
