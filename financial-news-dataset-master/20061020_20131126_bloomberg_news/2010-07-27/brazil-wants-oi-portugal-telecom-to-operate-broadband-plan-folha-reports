             Brazil’s government wants  Tele Norte
Leste Participacoes SA  and Portugal Telecom SGPS SA to become
partners in a plan to expand broadband Internet access across
the country, Folha de S. Paulo reported, without saying where it
got the information.  
 As part of the plan discussed by Brazilian President  Luiz Inacio Lula  da Silva and Portuguese Prime Minister  Jose Socrates , Portugal Telecom would have a minority stake in Tele
Norte, known as Oi, the newspaper said. Oi would have a minority
stake in the Portuguese company’s operations in Europe and
Africa, Folha said.  
 The government wants Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA, known
as Telebras, to manage the broadband project, while Oi and
Portugal Telecom would implement the plan, Folha reported.
 Luciano Coutinho , president of state-controlled development bank
BNDES, is in charge of the group studying how to carry out an
agreement between Oi and Portugal Telecom, Folha said.
