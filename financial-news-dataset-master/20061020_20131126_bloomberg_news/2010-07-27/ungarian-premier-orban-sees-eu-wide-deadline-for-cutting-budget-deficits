             Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said he expects the European Union to introduce a single
deadline for member countries to reduce their budget deficits to
the bloc’s deadline of 3 percent of gross domestic product.  
 “It would be unacceptable, and it won’t happen, that
certain countries would have to do it sooner, while others would
be allowed to do it later,” Orban said in an interview on public
television channel  M1  late last night. He expects the deadline
to be set in October.  
 Hungary’s previous government pledged to cut the budget
 shortfall  to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011. Orban reiterated that
the government will introduce a flat, 16-percent personal income
tax in January, adding that the complete switchover may take
several years.  
 Orban said the  International Monetary Fund  “over-expanded
the framework of the current contract” with Hungary when the
Washington-based lender tried to tell the government what
measures to implement to reach this year’s deficit target. A tax
on financial institutions, one of the contentious issues in the
talks, “is none of their business,” Orban said.
