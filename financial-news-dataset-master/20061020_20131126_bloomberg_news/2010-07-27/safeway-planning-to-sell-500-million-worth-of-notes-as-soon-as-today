             Safeway Inc. , the fourth-largest
U.S. supermarket chain by revenue, sold $500 million of 10-year
notes at a lower yield than larger rival  Kroger Co. ’s existing
debt due 2020.  
 Safeway’s notes pay 95 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Kroger’s notes due 2020, the closest maturity to the new
Safeway issue, traded July 26 at 115.771 cents on the dollar to
yield 4.12 percent, a 109.8 basis-point spread, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  
 “Safeway bonds have rallied strongly and now trade at or
through comparable Kroger bonds,”  Craig Hutson , senior bond
analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, an independent corporate bond
research firm, wrote in an e-mailed note. Hutson said in the
note that he wouldn’t buy the new issue given the differential
to Kroger’s bonds and the Cincinnati-based retailer’s “much
better operational track record.”  
 “Safeway should be more like 10 basis points in back of
Kroger for a comparable 10-year issue,” Hutson said in a
telephone interview.  
 Safeway, based in Pleasanton, California, said July 22
that second-quarter net income fell to $141.3 million, or 37
cents a share, from $238.6 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier,
when it had a tax benefit, according to a company statement.
Results matched the average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  
 Forecast Cut  
 The grocer lowered its annual profit forecast on price-
deflation expectations, Chief Executive Officer  Steve Burd  said
in the statement.  
 Proceeds from the debt sale will be used to repay $500
million of 4.95 percent notes that mature Aug. 16, according to
the prospectus, which didn’t specify the size or timing of the
sale. Christiane Pelz, a Safeway spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  
 Safeway last tapped the credit market a year ago, when it
sold $500 million of notes due August 2019, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That debt yielded 5.12 percent, or 158
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the data
show.  
 The 2019 notes, the closest maturity to the new issue,
traded July 23 at 108.785 cents on the dollar to yield 3.84
percent, an 89.8 basis-point spread, according to Trace data.  
 Debt Reduction  
 Kroger, the second-largest supermarket chain by revenue,
sold $300 million of 30-year notes on July 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt yielded 155 basis points more
than Treasuries, the data show.  
 Meghan Glynn , a Kroger spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  
 Fitch Ratings, in a report today, assigned Safeway’s
proposed offering a BBB rating. Monica Aggarwal, an analyst at
Fitch who contributed to the report, said in an interview today
that Fitch expects Safeway to continue “directing cash flow
towards debt reduction over time” to maintain its credit
metrics.  
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  is the largest supermarket chain by
revenue and  Costco Wholesale Corp.  is the third-biggest.
