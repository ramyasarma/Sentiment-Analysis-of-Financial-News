             Electrical utility Pepco had more
than 30,000 customers still without power after a storm hit the
Washington, D.C., area three days before.  
 About 32,000 households and businesses in Maryland’s
Montgomery and  Prince George  counties and in the District of
Columbia were lacking power, a  Pepco  spokesman said.  
 The number of customers that lost power on July 25 was over
300,000, said David Morehead, Pepco spokesman.  
 It wasn’t only home freezers that went warm.  
 At Classic Bakery Inc., a pastry shop in Gaithersburg,
Maryland, owner Rubic Novsessian had to dispose of large amounts
of gelato, milk and cream after he lost power when the short,
intense storm passed through the region.  
 “The problem wasn’t that we had to close, but all the food
that went to waste,” he said, estimating his losses at about
$1,000. The power returned about 24 hours later.  
 Other area businesses reported greater losses. At Starvin
Marvin Pizza Shop in Gaithersburg, lost sales and products were
estimated at $5,000. The shop lost power for 26 hours.  
 The storm, which briefly generated near-hurricane-force
winds, killed three people.  
 The majority of the outages were expected to be repaired by
July 29, said Bob Hainey, a Pepco spokesman.  
 Those who had lost a direct electrical line from a pole to
their house or business would have to wait longer as PEPCO was
focusing on repairing circuits that provide power to as many as
2,000 people at a time, Hainey said.  
 More than 450 workers, including some arriving from as far
as Ohio and Pennsylvania, were toiling around the clock to
restore electricity, he said.
