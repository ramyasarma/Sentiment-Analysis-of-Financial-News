             Gilead Sciences Inc. , the world’s
largest maker of AIDS drugs, issued $2.2 billion of convertible
notes in the biggest sale in eight months as the securities are
poised for their best monthly gain since July 2009.  
 Gilead sold $1.1 billion of 1 percent convertible notes due
in 2014 and $1.1 billion of 1.625 percent convertible securities
maturing in 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
sale was the biggest since Ford Motor Co.’s $2.5 billion issue
on Nov. 3 of 4.25 percent convertible bonds due in 2016.  
 The offering brings convertible dollar bond sales this year
to $18.46 billion excluding self-led deals, the slowest pace
since 2005, Bloomberg data show. Convertible bond issuance has
tumbled since 2008 after they lost 29.4 percent following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., even as the debt
rallied 45.6 percent last year and 4.5 percent in 2010.  
 “There’s been a significant scarcity of new paper in the
convert market and demand has been robust,”  Venu Krishna , a
Barclays Capital analyst in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “The fact that transactions have started coming back
is a very good sign.”  
 Convertible debt offerings this year compare with issuance
of $18.5 billion for the comparable period in 2009 and $40.3
billion for the same timeframe in 2008, Bloomberg data show.  
 Conversion Premium  
 The securities have returned 5.5 percent this month as of
July 26, compared with a 1.55 percent gain for the overall
corporate credit market, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. Convertibles gained 6.87 percent in July 2009.  
 Gilead’s 2014 notes have a conversion premium of about 35
percent and the 2016 notes a premium of about 36 percent over
the closing price of the company’s common stock on July 26,
which was $33.39 per share, the Foster City, California-based
company said today in a statement distributed by Business Wire.  
 Gilead fell 13 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $33.26 at 3:19
p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  
 Proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of its common
stock, to help fund convertible-note hedging transactions and
for general corporate purposes, Gilead said.  
 The sale was the second convertible offering this month of
more than $1 billion, Bloomberg data show. There were two
offerings of more than $1 billion in June and one sale of at
least that size in May.  
 “These are what we call jumbo deals, which are $1 billion
or more in size,” Krishna said. “It means that liquidity is
likely to be good in these issues.”
