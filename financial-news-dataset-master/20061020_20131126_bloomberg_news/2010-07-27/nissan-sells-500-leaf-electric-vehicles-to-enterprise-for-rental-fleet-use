             Nissan Motor Co. , aiming to become
the world’s biggest producer of electric vehicles, said it is
selling rechargeable Leaf hatchbacks to Enterprise Holdings Inc.
for use in the rental-car company’s U.S. operations.  
 Enterprise, operator of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Alamo and
National car rental lots and the  WeCar  car-sharing service, is
buying 500 lithium-ion-powered Leafs,  Katherine Zachary , a
spokeswoman for Nissan, said in a phone interview. The first
vehicles are to be delivered to Enterprise in January, she said.  
 Nissan, Japan’s third-largest automaker, aims to sell at
least 20,000 units of the $32,780 Leaf in the U.S. during the
model’s first year, following its U.S. introduction late this
year. Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  has set a goal of
expanding global Leaf production to as many as 500,000 vehicles
by the end of 2012.  
 The sale of Nissan electric cars to St. Louis-based
Enterprise is the second such arrangement for Nissan, which said
in February it would supply Leafs to  Hertz Global Holdings  for
use in rental fleets in the U.S. and Europe.  
 Nissan is based in Yokohama, Japan. Its North American
operations are based in Franklin, Tennessee.  
 The sale of Leaf cars to Enterprise was reported earlier by
the Wall Street Journal.
