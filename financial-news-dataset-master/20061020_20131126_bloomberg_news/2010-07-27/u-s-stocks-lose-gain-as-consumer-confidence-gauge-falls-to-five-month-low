             U.S. stocks pared gains after
consumer confidence trailed economists’ forecasts.  
 The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,115.93 at 10:06 a.m. New York time after climbing as much as
0.5 percent following better-than-estimated  earnings  at
companies from DuPont Co. to Lexmark International Inc.  
 Confidence among U.S. consumers declined in July to a five-
month low, a sign the lack of jobs will limit the economy’s
recovery. The Conference Board’s confidence index fell to 50.4
from a revised 54.3 in June, figures from the New York-based
private research group showed today. The gauge was forecast to
drop to 51, according the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.
