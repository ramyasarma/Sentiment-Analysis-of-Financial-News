             Climate-change measures scrapped by
the Senate may still be passed this year, according to White
House press secretary  Robert Gibbs .  
 A bill capping carbon-dioxide emissions blamed for global
warming isn’t “essentially dead for the year,” Gibbs said
today in his briefing for reporters. Scaled-back energy
legislation may be passed by the Senate and then changed during
negotiations with the House of Representatives for a final bill,
he said.  
 The House passed legislation limiting carbon pollution last
year while a similar measure lagged in the Senate. Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, has said there
aren’t enough votes for climate provisions to be included in an
energy bill aimed at setting tougher safety rules for oil and
gas drillers.  
 President  Barack Obama  said today that he will keep
pressing for climate-change legislation  
 The Senate’s current bill is an “important step in the
right direction,” Obama said after meeting with congressional
leaders. “But I want to emphasize it’s only the first step, and
I intend to keep pushing for broader reform, including climate
legislation.”
