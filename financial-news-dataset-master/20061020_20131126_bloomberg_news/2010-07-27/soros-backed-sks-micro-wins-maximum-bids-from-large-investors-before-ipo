             SKS Microfinance Ltd. , the Indian
lender backed by  George Soros  and Sequoia Capital, attracted
bids for all the shares offered to anchor investors in its
initial sale, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  
 The shares are likely to be sold to the funds bidding today
at the maximum price sought of 985 rupees, the people said,
declining to be named before an official announcement. The
company had offered as much as 18 percent of the equity to
anchor investors, or institutional investors required to hold
the shares for at least 30 days, according to a July 16  filing .  
 SKS, India’s largest microfinance lender, and its
stakeholders are seeking to raise as much as $347 million in an
offer that opens for other investors tomorrow. The Hyderabad-
based company aims to bolster credit to the nation’s poorest in
a market where about 120 million households don’t have access to
banking and financial services.  
 Kotak Mahindra Capital Co.,  Citigroup Inc.  and Credit
Suisse Group AG are managing the IPO, in which shares are on
offer for 850 rupees to 985 rupees each.  
 Atul Takle , a spokesman for SKS, declined to comment.
Spokespeople for the banks didn’t immediately reply to e-mails
seeking comment.
