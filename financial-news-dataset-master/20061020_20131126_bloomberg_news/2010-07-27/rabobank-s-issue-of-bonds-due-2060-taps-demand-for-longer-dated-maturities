             Rabobank Nederland NV  issued 300
million pounds ($466 million) of bonds due 2060 as the world’s
largest agricultural lender tapped demand for long-dated
maturities.  
 The notes were priced to yield 100 basis points more than
the 4.25 percent U.K. gilt due 2055, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings Plc managed the deal with Utrecht,
Netherlands-based Rabobank.  
 Investor appetite for longer-dated notes is rising as
global interest rates remain near record low levels, companies
post earnings that beat forecasts and the global economy shows
signs of growth. The extra yield investors demand over U.K. debt
to hold company bonds in pounds with a maturity of more than 20
years is 216 basis points, down from 626 basis points in March
last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.  
 “There have been very few very long-dated bonds, so we
jumped in,” said  Rogier Everwijn , the bank’s director of long-
term funding. “We decided to sell a bond with a longer maturity
to tap demand from real money investors like pension funds and
insurance companies.”  
 The last issue of bonds with a maturity of 50 years or more
was 18 months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investment company Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH issued 100 million
euros of 55-year notes in December 2008, the same month U.K.
power network operator National Grid Plc sold bonds in pounds
maturing 2058.  
 Rabobank is rated AAA by Standard & Poor’s, the highest
investment-grade ranking, and an equivalent Aaa at Moody’s
Investors Service.
