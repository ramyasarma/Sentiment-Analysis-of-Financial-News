             Portugal Telecom SGPS SA
may reach an agreement within days to  buy a stake in Brazil’s
 Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA  as talks are advancing, said a
person with direct knowledge of the negotiations.  
 The owners of Tele Norte, also known as Oi, would likely
control Brazil’s biggest phone operator under the terms, which
are still being discussed, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private.  
 A deal with Oi may allow Portugal Telecom to sell its stake
in its existing Brazilian venture, Brasilcel NV, to  Telefonica
SA . The Spanish company earlier this month ended a 7.15 billion-
euro ($9.3 billion) bid for Brasilcel, turning down a request
from Portugal Telecom to extend the offer beyond July 16.  
 The Portuguese government blocked Telefonica’s offer for
Portugal Telecom’s 50 percent stake in Brasilcel because it was
concerned the former phone monopoly would be left without a
fast-growing asset. Brasilcel controls  Vivo Participacoes SA ,
Brazil’s largest wireless operator.  
 Spokespeople for Portugal Telecom, Oi and Telefonica
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News yesterday.  
 Carlos Jereissati’s  Grupo Jereissati is the only Tele Norte
shareholder that opposes the sale of a stake to Portugal
Telecom, Exame magazine reported yesterday, without saying where
it got the information. Grupo Jereissati is against the deal
because the sale of a stake to a foreign investor may diminish
the group’s power, the magazine said.  
 ‘Great Potential’  
 Vivo rose 32 centavos, or 0.7 percent, to 46.32 reais in
Sao Paulo trading yesterday. The shares have fallen 15 percent
this year, compared with a drop of 2.8 percent for the benchmark
Bovespa index. Tele Norte preferred shares climbed 85 centavos,
or 2.9 percent, to 30.60 reais in Sao Paulo trading. The stock
has fallen 8.7 percent this year.  
 Portugal Telecom investor  Banco Espirito Santo SA  said on
July 26 that the phone company should invest in Brazil if it
sells the Brasilcel stake and that Oi may have “great
potential.”  
 Rio de Janeiro-based Oi provides Internet access, mobile,
fixed-line and paid television services. The company on May 14
reported a record first-quarter  profit  after acquiring its
smaller rival Brasil Telecom SA in 2009.  
 Privately held  Telemar Participacoes SA  controls Oi’s
holding company Tele Norte, which has publicly traded voting and
 preferred  shares. Investors in Telemar Participacoes include AG
Telecom, La Fonte Telecom SA and pension fund Fundacao Atlantico
de Seguridade Social, according to Oi’s website.
