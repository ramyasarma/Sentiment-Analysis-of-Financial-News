             Credit Agricole SA  and  Societe
Generale SA  led French banks higher in Paris trading on
speculation softer rules on capital and liquidity from the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision will help earnings.  
 Credit Agricole, France’s third-largest bank, rose 10
percent to 10.63 euros at 12:44 p.m., the biggest gainer in the
54- member  Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index,
which advanced 3.4 percent. Societe Generale, the country’s
second biggest, climbed 8.5 percent to 43.40 euros.  
 “The sky is starting to clear up, reconsidering the long-
term liquidity ratio is essential” for French banks as their
earnings would have suffered under the previous Basel proposals,
said Pierre Flabbee, an analyst with Kepler Capital Markets in
Paris. He rates Credit Agricole “hold” and recommends buying
Societe Generale’s shares.  
 The Basel panel agreed yesterday to allow certain assets,
including minority stakes in other financial firms, to count as
capital. Liquidity requirements for how much cash and cashable
securities banks need to hold against their longer-term
liabilities and counter-cyclical buffers, which would raise
minimum capital requirements in times of faster economic growth,
have to be worked on longer, the board also said.
