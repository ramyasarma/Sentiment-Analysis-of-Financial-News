             India plans to conduct stress tests
on its banks twice a year to check credit and interest rate
risks, the Financial Times reported today, citing Duvvuri
Subbarao, governor of the Reserve Bank of India.  
 The central bank held basic tests on the banks during the
global financial crisis and plans to have more thorough checks
in the future on how much financial pressure the lenders can
withstand in a crisis, the newspaper quoted Subbarao as saying
yesterday.  
 The governor’s comments follow similar tests in Europe in
which seven of 91 banks that were checked failed to meet capital
requirements set by the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors, according to the report.
