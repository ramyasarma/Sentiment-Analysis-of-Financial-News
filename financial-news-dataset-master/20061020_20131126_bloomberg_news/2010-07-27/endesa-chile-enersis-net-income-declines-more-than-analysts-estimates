             Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA ,
Chile’s biggest electricity generator, and its controlling
shareholder reported bigger-than-estimated declines in profit.  
 Endesa Chile’s second-quarter profit fell to 115 billion
pesos ($221 million) from 165 billion pesos a year earlier,
according to a statement posted today on the website of Chile’s
securities regulator.  Enersis SA , its controller, said in a
separate statement that profit halved to 106 billion pesos.  
 The average estimate of three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 120 billion pesos for Endesa Chile and 134
billion pesos for Enersis. Endesa Chile shares rose 1.5 percent
to 894 pesos while Enersis was little changed at 224.97 pesos.  
 Endesa Chile’s net income slid 37 percent in the first six
months of the year because of lower generation levels in Chile,
higher operating costs in Colombia and lower sales to “free”
clients in Peru, the Santiago-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. Higher tax reduced Enersis’ profit, it wrote.
