             Sanofi-Aventis SA , France’s leading
drugmaker, sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make it
withdraw clearance of a lower-cost rival to the company’s
Lovenox blood thinner.  
 Sanofi ’s lawsuit, filed yesterday in a federal court in
Washington, asks a judge to force the FDA to suspend its
approval of the generic produced by  Novartis AG ’s Sandoz unit
with  Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. ’s technology. Lovenox, an
injection that helps prevent blood clots, was  Sanofi ’s No. 2
product last year, after the diabetes medicine Lantus.  
 Novartis, the Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker, and
Momenta, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
won U.S. approval for a lower-cost copy of Lovenox on July 23,
ending a five year wait to challenge the $3.9 billion-a-year
product. In the complaint, Sanofi said the generic isn’t
“clinically equivalent” to Lovenox, and the FDA’s decision may
cause Sanofi “irreparable harm.”  
 The FDA’s approval “was not made in accordance with the
agency’s statutory obligations,”  Jean-Marc Podvin , a spokesman
for Paris-based  Sanofi , said in an e-mailed statement today.
Sanofi “believes that this case poses a number of significant
questions regarding the FDA review process for complex
pharmaceutical products which are important to pursue.”  
 Momenta fell $3.25, or 13 percent, to $22.86 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares
had risen 9.8 percent on July 23 and 4.4 percent yesterday in
the wake of the FDA clearance of the generic drug.  
 Path to Approval  
 The path for approval of Novartis and Momenta’s generic
drug was cleared when Sanofi’s patent was voided last year. In
April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact a lower court
ruling that said the patent wasn’t enforceable because Sanofi
had misled the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Court
rejected Sanofi’s appeal seeking reinstatement of the patent
that could have prevented competition until 2012.  
 A federal judge said yesterday he would hold a hearing on
the case on Aug. 17, Momenta said today in a statement. The
court didn’t place any restrictions on the sale of the generic
drug, according to the statement.  
 A different federal judge in Washington yesterday threw out
a suit Sanofi filed over the FDA’s decision to approve
applications for generic forms of its anti-cancer drug Eloxatin.
Sanofi has settled with some of the generic-drug companies and
has gotten a court order stopping  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd.  from selling generics.  
 The case involving Lovenox is Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC v.
Food and Drug Administration, 10cv1255, U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia (Washington).
