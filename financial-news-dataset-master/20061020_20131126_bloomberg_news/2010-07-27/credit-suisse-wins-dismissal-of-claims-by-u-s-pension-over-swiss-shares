             Credit Suisse Group AG won a
decision in New York federal court today dismissing claims by a
U.S. pension fund that bought Credit Suisse Global shares on the
Swiss Stock Exchange. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero,
applying the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent “Morrison” decision,
said U.S. buyers of a foreign stock on a foreign exchange can’t
sue for securities fraud under U.S. law.
