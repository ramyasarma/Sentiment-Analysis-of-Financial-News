             Lockheed Martin Corp. , the world’s
largest defense company, said second-quarter profit jumped 12
percent and increased its forecast for full-year earnings as
sales at its space and information-systems units picked up.  
 Net income  rose to $825 million, or $2.22 a share, from
$734 million, or $1.88, a year earlier, the Bethesda, Maryland-
based company said today in a statement. Profit from continuing
operations of $1.96 a share beat the $1.78  average estimate  of
19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Robert Stevens  has announced the
sale or spinoff of two units and a voluntary retirement program
for senior executives in a bid to cut costs and improve profit
margins after U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  said the
“gusher of defense spending” of the past decade would be
“turned off.”  
 “In the new reality of escalating demands and increasing
constraints on resources, we continue to refine our portfolio of
capabilities and services,” Stevens said in today’s statement.  
 Lockheed rose 69 cents to $75.57 at 10:28 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange  composite trading . The shares had declined less
than 1 percent this year through yesterday.  
 Full-year profit from continuing operations may be in the
range of $7.15 to $7.35 a share, an increase of 15 cents at both
ends, Lockheed said, citing improved margins at the space unit
and the impact of a share buyback program. The average estimate
of analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for $7.33.  
 2010 Forecast  
 Lockheed said the higher forecast will be aided by a $30
million increase at the Space Systems unit, offsetting the
potential loss of $30 million of earnings from the anticipated
sale of its Pacific Architects & Engineers subsidiary, a
provider of embassy and disaster-relief services.  
 Lockheed said 2010 profit also will benefit from a 15-cents
-a-share improvement due to the lower share count for the year.  
 The company’s share buybacks helped increase second-quarter
earnings and the forecast,  Noah Poponak , an analyst at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a note to clients today.  
 The number of diluted shares outstanding dropped 4.9
percent to 371.7 million last quarter from a year earlier.  
 Second-quarter revenue increased 3.3 percent to $11.4
billion. Sales for the full year will be in the range of $45.5
billion to $46.5 billion, or $750 million lower at both ends of
the range than the previous forecast because of the planned sale
of the PAE unit during the year, the company said.  
 PAE’s sale would reverse the purchase of the business in
2006. Lockheed said last month that it also aims to sell or spin
off Enterprise Integration Group to avoid a conflict between the
military consulting business and Lockheed’s role as a supplier
of gear such as satellites. Both PAE and EIG are part of the
company’s Information Systems and Global Solutions division.  
 ‘Strong Interest’  
 “We have had strong interest on both properties” from
possible buyers, Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Tanner  said in a
phone interview. Lockheed has signed 20 non-disclosure
agreements with potential acquirers of the EIG unit, he said.
Interest in PAE is “not quite as far along, but we expect more
next month,” he said.  
 Second quarter profit at the Space Systems unit, a provider
of rocket launch services and satellites to U.S. government and
intelligence agencies, rose 9.4 percent to $245 million, the
biggest gain of the company’s four segments.  
 Earnings at the Aeronautics unit, the maker of F-35, F-16
and F-22 jet fighters, declined 6.8 percent to $372 million
because of lower sales of combat jets, the company said.  
 Profit at the Information Systems division rose 6.3 percent
to $238 million because of a better performance on non-defense
computer contracts, Lockheed said. During the quarter, the unit
won a $5 billion order from the U.S. Special Operations Command
to manage its computer systems.  
 “We expect to see margin improvement” at the Information
Systems unit because of the new contract and the addressing of
“execution issues on a classified program,”  Douglas Harned , an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. in New York, wrote in a July
26 note to clients. He rates the shares as “overweight.”
