             Turkish  stocks  rose to a record
after the central bank lowered its forecast for inflation this
year, raising speculation the central bank will delay rate
increases.  
 The main ISE National 100 index increased 846.39, or 1.4
percent, to 60,354.07 at 11:25 a.m. in Istanbul, the highest
level since at least January 1990, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS and  Akbank TAS  led gains.  
 Turkey’s central bank revised its forecast for year-end
inflation to 7.5 percent from the 8.4 percent it predicted in
April, Governor  Durmus Yilmaz  said at a news conference in
Ankara today. The central bank foresees at “limited rise” in
the benchmark interest rate next year, Yilmaz said.  
 “Lower inflation means the central bank won’t raise
interest rates, and banks will benefit from it this year,” said
 Altug Dag , a trader at EFG Istanbul Securities. “Improved bank
earnings expectations are also adding to gains.”  
 The lira was little changed at 1.5141 per dollar. Bonds
rose, sending the yields on Turkey’s two-year benchmark bonds
down four basis points to 8.16 percent, according to an ABN Amro
Holding NV  index .  
 Turkish banks are expected to report second-quarter results
by an Aug. 13 deadline. Garanti is expected to earn  910 million
liras  in the second quarter, according to the average of eight
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Garanti reported a second-
quarter profit of 765.1 million liras last year.
