             What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  
 -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as drought reduces Russian
production, said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  
 -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher
on speculation that the drought in parts of Europe and Ukraine
is reducing oilseed production, Henderson said. Soybean-meal
futures may open $2 to $3 higher per 2,000 pounds, and soybean
oil is expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher.  
 -- Wheat futures may open 9 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as the drought in Europe and excessive rain in
Canada reduced planting, Henderson said.
