             JPMorgan Chase & Co. halted a short
position on the pound after Britain’s currency broke above
April’s high.  
 “While the near-term setup argues for some pause, today’s
upside break suggests an increased risk for additional upside,”
 Niall O’Connor , a technical analyst in New York at the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, wrote in a research note today.  
 The pound rallied 0.5 percent to $1.5569 after earlier
advancing as much as 0.6 percent to $1.5578, the highest level
since Feb. 18. Sterling traded above the 200-day moving average
for the first time since Jan. 28, according to Bloomberg data.
The pound broke the April high of $1.5526, according to
JPMorgan.  
 The pound may dip to support of $1.5385 before advancing to
a range of $1.5750 and $1.5865, O’Connor wrote.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A support level is an area on a
chart where orders to buy a currency versus a counterpart may be
placed, potentially blocking a decline. A short position is a
bet a security will drop.
