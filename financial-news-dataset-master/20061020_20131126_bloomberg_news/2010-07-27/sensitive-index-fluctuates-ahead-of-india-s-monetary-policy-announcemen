             India’s benchmark stock index rose
after the central bank increased borrowing costs more than
expected, signaling policy makers are confident the pace of
economic growth is robust.  
 DLF Ltd., the nation’s biggest real estate developer,
gained 2.2 percent, reversing a drop before the decision.
Domestic economic recovery is firmly in place and is
strengthening, central bank Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  said in a 
statement after today’s rate decision. State Bank of India, the
largest lender, advanced 1 percent.  
 “Foreign investors will find India attractive,” said
 Navneet Munot , who oversees about $8.2 billion as chief
investment officer at SBI Funds Management Pvt. in Mumbai.
“Capacity constraints are emerging across sectors, and that
will lead to a revival of private capital expenditure that
augurs well for investment-related stocks. Engineering and
construction companies are likely to benefit.”  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or  Sensex ,
gained 57.56, or 0.3 percent, to 18,077.61. The S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index on the National Stock Exchange advanced 0.2 percent at
5,430.60. The  BSE 200 Index  increased 0.3 percent to 2,297.62.  
 DLF  rose 2.2 percent to 320.05 rupees. State Bank of India
advanced 1 percent to 2,435.15 rupees. Reliance Infrastructure
Ltd., the third-largest utility, climbed 0.9 percent to 1,147.6
rupees. ACC Ltd., a cement maker, added 3 percent to 848.45
rupees.  
 ‘Investment Intentions’  
 India’s economic recovery is “reflected in the sales and
profitability growth of the corporate sector,” Subbarao said.
“Besides replenishment of inventories, investment intentions
are being translated into action across sectors, particularly in
power, telecom and metals.”  
 Reliance Industries Ltd. , the nation’s most valuable
company, was little changed at 1,053.5 rupees. The operator of
the world’s largest refining complex is due to announce its
earnings for the June quarter after today’s stock market close.
Net income in the three months ended June 30 is expected to rise
33 percent to 48.4 billion rupees ($1.04 billion), based on the
mean estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 The Reserve Bank of India raised the  reverse repurchase
rate  to 4.5 percent from 4 percent and the repurchase rate to
5.75 percent from 5.5 percent, according to a statement from the
central bank in Mumbai. The median forecast in Bloomberg News
surveys was for quarter-point increases in both rates.  
 Inflation  
 Consumer prices paid by industrial and farm workers in
India are running close to 14 percent, government data show.
That’s the most after Venezuela’s 32 percent inflation rate,
according to Bloomberg data compiled from 82 countries. Policy
makers have raised borrowing costs four times since mid-March to
cool the pace of price increases.  
 The Sensex is valued at 17 times estimated earnings,
compared with a multiple of 13 times for the MSCI AC World Index
that tracks both emerging and developed nations. The valuation
is the highest in Asia excluding Japan and among the BRIC
countries that also include China, India and Russia.  
 “In the mind of investors it is clear that the long-term
India growth story is gaining momentum,” said  Vikram Kotak , who
manages $3.5 billion in assets as chief investment officer at
Birla Sun Life Insurance Co. “We continue to remain positive on
banking, capital goods and cement shares.” He declined to name
specific stocks.  
 Overseas  funds  bought a net  8.45 billion rupees  of Indian
equities on July 23, raising total investments in the stocks
this year to 420.5 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  
 Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years ago in local currency
terms, as the biggest advance in 18 years lured foreign funds.
They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in 2008,
triggering a record annual decline.  
 The following were among the most active on the exchange:  
  Essar Oil Ltd.  (ESOIL IN) lost 1.7 percent to 128.35 rupees.
India’s second-biggest non-state refiner had a first-quarter
loss of 700 million rupees, compared with a profit of 1.7
billion rupees a year earlier, the company said in an e-mailed
statement. Sales rose 52 percent, the statement said.  
 Hero Honda Motors Ltd.  (HH IN) soared 3.3 percent to 1,863
rupees.  Honda Motor Co.,  Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, denied
it is selling a stake in the maker of half the motorcycles in
India. CNBC-TV18 reported on July 23 that Honda might sell about
6 percent of the New Delhi-based motorcycle maker, without
saying where it got the information.  
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd.  (LT IN) dropped 2.9 percent to
1,863.65 rupees, its steepest decline in a month. India’s
biggest engineering company reported first-quarter profit of
6.66 billion rupees, compared with the 6.8 billion-rupees
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  
 Tech Mahindra Ltd.  (TECHM IN) declined 3.7 percent to
710.45 rupees. The software company that bought Satyam Computer
Services Ltd. was cut to “neutral” from “overweight” by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts  Nishit Jasani  and  Viju K George .
