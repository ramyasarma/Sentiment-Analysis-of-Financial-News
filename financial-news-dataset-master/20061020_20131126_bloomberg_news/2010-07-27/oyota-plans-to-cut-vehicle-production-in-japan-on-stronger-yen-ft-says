             Toyota Motor Corp. plans to cut
vehicle production in Japan by a further 15 percent over the
next five to six years, the Financial Times reported.   
 The Japanese automaker aims to reduce output to about 70
percent of its current domestic capacity of 3.9 million
vehicles, the newspaper said, citing Executive Vice President
Atsushi Niimi.  
 Toyota will expand production in China, Brazil and the U.S.
because of the strong yen, the report said.
