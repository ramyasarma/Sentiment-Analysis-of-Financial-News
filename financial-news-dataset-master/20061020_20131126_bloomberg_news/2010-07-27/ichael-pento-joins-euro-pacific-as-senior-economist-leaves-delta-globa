             Michael Pento , who correctly
predicted the 2008 commodity market collapse, joined Euro
Pacific Capital as a senior economist.  
 Pento said today in a telephone interview that he will be
based in New York and cover macro-economic trends and
“international investment and commodities, in particular
precious metals.” He will also serve as the firm’s vice
president for managed products.  
 Pento was previously a Holmdel, New Jersey-based senior
market strategist at Delta Global Advisors of Huntington Beach,
California. Euro Pacific is run by  Peter Schiff , who predicted
the recession in 2006.
