             The dollar advanced against most of
its major counterparts as a decline in U.S. consumer sentiment
to a five-month low revived demand for the relative safety of
the world’s main reserve currency.  
 The euro climbed to a two-month high against the yen and
gained versus the Swiss franc after a report showed German
consumer  confidence  will rise in August. The dollar rallied the
most versus the yen in almost two months after  yields  on two-
year Treasury notes increased as the government sold $38 billion
of the securities.  
 “There a bit of sobering up after a nice run-up in the
last couple of days,” said  Carl Forcheski , a director on the
corporate currency sales desk at Societe Generale SA in New
York. “It’s risk on versus risk off.”  
 The dollar traded at $1.3006 per euro at 4:08 p.m. in New
York, compared with $1.2994 yesterday, after reaching $1.3046,
the weakest level since May 10. The yen lost 1.3 percent to
114.37 per euro, from 112.89, after reaching 114.38, the weakest
level since May 21.  
 Canada’s currency slid 0.4 percent to C$1.0360 per U.S.
dollar and the Norwegian krone lost 0.1 percent to 6.1687 as a
fluctuation in stocks on the U.S. sentiment data discouraged
demand for currencies related to economic growth.  
 The Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence dropped
to 50.4 this month from a revised 54.3 in June, the New York-
based private research group reported today. The median forecast
of 73 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a slide to
51 from a previously reported 52.9.  
 Fluctuating Equities  
 The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost 0.1 percent after
earlier rising 0.5 percent and erasing its decline since Dec.
31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 percent.  
 The U.S. currency advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 87.97
yen in the biggest intraday gain since June 2. Treasury two-year
note  yields  increased as much as 0.06 percentage point to 0.64
percent in the biggest intraday climb since June 10. The
government sold the securities in the first of three note
auctions this week totaling $104 billion.  
 The dollar-yen’s recent weakness “has been related to the
very low level of U.S. yields,” said  Todd Elmer , a currency
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York. “The fact that
they’re rebounding at this stage is likely to lend the pair some
support.”  
 The euro rallied versus the yen as the Nuremberg-based
market research company GfK AG said a German consumer sentiment
index based on a survey of 2,000 people will climb to 3.9 in
August from a revised 3.6 this month. The median forecast of 25
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for the index to remain
unchanged at July’s initial reading of 3.5.  
 Weaker Franc  
 The Swiss franc depreciated 1.2 percent to 1.3789 per euro,
from 1.3625, after earlier declining to 1.3796, the weakest
level since June 21.  
 The Brazilian real’s 6.2 percent appreciation versus the
greenback over the past two months spurred speculation that the
central bank will buy dollars in the futures market for the
first time in 14 months.  
 Central bank officials called currency traders on July 23
to gauge their demand for reverse currency swaps, which allow
policy makers to sell the real for dollars in the futures
market, according to BNP Paribas SA, Nomura Holdings Inc. and CM
Capital Markets. A central bank official declined to comment
yesterday.  
 Brazil’s real depreciated 0.4 percent to 1.7698 per dollar,
from 1.7624. It reached 1.7496 on July 13, the strongest level
since May 4.  
 Outlook for Real  
 “Appreciation potential for the Brazilian real is
limited,”  Win Thin , a senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, wrote in a note to clients.
“For now, that 1.75 floor seems to be a formidable barrier for
the Brazilian real, but a stronger risk-on trading environment
could see that level broken.”  
 Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  refrained from
commenting on the yen’s strength today in a departure from his
predecessor’s attempts to curb volatility by speaking about
movements in foreign-exchange markets.  
 When asked by reporters about the currency, which has
hovered at almost a seven-month high against the dollar since
the European bank stress tests, Noda only said investors
welcomed the results of the examination.  
 The yen has averaged 90.92 against the dollar in 2010,
putting it on course for its strongest year against the U.S.
dollar since currencies began trading freely in 1971, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 That will limit profit at Toyota Motor Corp., Panasonic
Corp. and other companies scheduled to report earnings over the
next two weeks even as exports have climbed for the past seven
straight months.  
 The yen has advanced 9.3 percent this year in the biggest
gain among developed-world counterparts, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indices. The euro has dropped 7.7
percent, while the dollar is up 2.8 percent.
