             The rand strengthened to a 3 1/2-
month high against the dollar as speculation a foreign investor
may purchase South Africa’s fourth-largest bank boosted
sentiment toward the currency.  
 The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated as
much as 0.8 percent to 7.2932 per dollar, the strongest level
since April 15, before trading at 7.3296 as of 4:35 p.m. in
Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.3537.  
 HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc are in talks
to buy Old Mutual’s 52-percent holding in South Africa’s
Nedbank, the  Financial Times  reported at the weekend in  Mark Kleinman ’s “In the Loop” column. That may add to Nippon
Telegraph & Telephone Corp.’s $3.2 billion acquisition of
 Dimension Data Plc  of which half is expected to flow into South
Africa when the deal concludes in October.  
 “The bias is clearly for a stronger rand,” said  John Cairns , head of foreign-exchange research at Rand Merchant Bank
in Johannesburg. “The NTT-Didata deal will bring in another 12
billion rand and now there is fresh speculation of an offshore
bid for Nedbank.”  
 Foreign investors have been net purchasers of 79.7 billion
rand ($10.9 billion) of South African stocks and bonds this
year, according to data from the JSE Ltd., which operates the
nation’s exchanges. Such inflows have helped the rand hold on to
last year’s almost 28 percent rally against the dollar.  
 “Rising risk appetite is certainly a reason” for the
capital inflows, said Cairns.  
 Unemployment Rises  
 South Africa’s currency maintained gains even after a
government report showed the nation’s  unemployment rate , the
highest of 62 countries tracked by Bloomberg, rose in the second
quarter. The jobless rate increased to 25.3 percent from 25.2
percent in the first quarter,  Statistics South Africa  said in
Pretoria.  
 Government bonds slid, with South Africa’s benchmark 13.5
percent security due September 2015 falling 8 cents to 124.32
rand. The yield on the bond increased 1 basis point to 7.66
percent.  
 Investors reduced bets that South Africa’s central bank may
lower its 6.5 percent benchmark interest rate when it next meets
on Sept. 9, forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-
month contracts for cash in three months  rose 7 basis points to
6.31 percent.
