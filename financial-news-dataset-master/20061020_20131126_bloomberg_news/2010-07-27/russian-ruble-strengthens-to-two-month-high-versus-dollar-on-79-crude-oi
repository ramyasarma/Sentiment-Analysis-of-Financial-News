             The ruble gained for a sixth day
against the dollar as crude oil topped $79 a barrel and higher-
than-expected U.S. home sales boosted appetite for riskier
assets.  
 The Russian currency added 0.5 percent to 30.1950 per
dollar by the 5 p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest level since
May 14. The yield on Russia’s benchmark dollar bonds due 2015
fell 7 basis points to 3.802 percent, the lowest since they were
issued in April.  
 Crude, Russia’s chief export, traded near $79 a barrel for
a fourth day and was at $79.55 a barrel when official ruble
trading ended. New U.S. home sales rose 24 percent in June from
May to an annual pace of 330,000, the Commerce Department said
yesterday.  
 “Oil is the usual suspect,” said  Vladimir Osakovsky , an
economist at UniCredit SpA in Moscow. “Markets are coming down
after the volatility of the previous months. The Greek issue is
fading away and risk appetite is recovering.”  
 Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.4194
per dollar in three months compared with an NDF of 30.4813 on
July 26. The contracts are a guide to expectations of currency
movements as they allow foreign investors and companies to fix
the exchange rate at a particular level in the future.  
 The currency weakened 0.1 percent against the euro to
39.2950, leaving it at 34.2900 against the central bank’s  target 
currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters.  
 The basket is calculated by multiplying the dollar’s rate
to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by 0.45, then
adding them together. The ruble remains within the 26 to 41 band
the central bank pledged January 2009 to defend.
