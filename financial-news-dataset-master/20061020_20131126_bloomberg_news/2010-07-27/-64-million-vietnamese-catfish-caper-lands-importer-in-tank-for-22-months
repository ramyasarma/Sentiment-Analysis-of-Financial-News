             A New Jersey seafood importer was
sentenced to 22 months for fraudulently importing Vietnamese
catfish and was ordered to pay $64 million in restitution for
evading anti-dumping tariffs.  
 Thomas George, 61, founder and former chief executive
officer of Sterling Seafood Corp. in Cresskill, New Jersey, also
must make a $50,000 community service payment to the National
Fish and Wildlife Foundation, U.S. District Judge  Faith Hochberg 
ruled in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.  
 George admitted he bought more than $539,000 in Vietnamese
catfish from a Virginia company and falsely resold it as grouper
and sole. George lives in Old Tappan, New Jersey.  
 George pleaded guilty on Jan. 26 to using false purchase
orders, manifests, bills of lading and other documents to
disguise catfish bought from a Vietnamese company.  
 In January 2003, the U.S. imposed an anti-dumping tariff on
all imports of Vietnamese catfish because it was being sold at
significantly lower prices than the market rates, according to
prosecutors.  
 George admitted he evaded the tariff from June 2004 to June
2006 through the importation of 5.28 million kilograms of a type
of catfish known as Pangasius hypophthalmus.  
 The case is United States of America v. George,
10-cr-29, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).
