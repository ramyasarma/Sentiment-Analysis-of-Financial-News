             Australia may be exempt from new
global liquidity rules due to to an exception for countries with
low levels of government debt, the Australian Financial Review
reported. Regulators meeting in Basel, Switzerland, agreed to
include assets other than government bonds to satisfy the
requirement for banks to build up more capital buffers,
according to the report. They will meet in September to review
the new standards, the newspaper said.
