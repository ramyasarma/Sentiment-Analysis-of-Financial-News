             Wheat rose for the first time in
three sessions on speculation that the prolonged drought in
Russia will slash output further, boosting demand for grain from
the U.S., the world’s largest exporter.  
 The harvest of crops including wheat, barley, rye and corn
may drop below 80 million metric tons, compared with the current
estimate of 85 million, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach 
said today. Russian grain traders may halt new export agreements
because the government may limit shipments, the Moscow-based
researcher SovEcon said last week.  
 “People are concerned that Russia may ban exports,” said
 Brian Grete , the senior market analyst for Professional Farmers
of America Newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Demand may increase
for crops from the U.S., Grete said.  
 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $5.95 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
falling 1.2 percent the previous two sessions. The price has
risen 39 percent since June 9 as drought damaged crops in parts
of Europe and Russia, while too much rain in Canada reduced the
area farmers planted this year.  
 Smaller Harvest  
 Russia’s grain harvest may fall below 70 million tons as
yields drop amid the worst drought in at least a decade, SovEcon
said today. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast Russian
production of wheat and feed grains at 79.8 million tons earlier
this month, down from 93.5 million last year.  
 The price of wheat in the European part of Russia rose 15
percent to 4,850 rubles ($160) a ton in the week ending July 23,
SovEcon said. Barley added 30 percent to 3,350 rubles a ton
during the week, while rye climbed 33 percent to 3,400 rubles a
ton.  
 “The trend has shifted from rising inventories to
declining supplies, said  Chad Henderson , a market analyst for
Prime Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin.  
 Wheat is the fourth-largest crop in the U.S., valued at
$10.6 billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
figures show.
