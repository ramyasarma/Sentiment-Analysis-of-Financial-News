             The yuan isn’t undervalued, He
Weiwen, director of the U.S.-China economic and trade research
center at the University of International Business and
Economics, wrote in a commentary published in today’s People’s
Daily newspaper.  
 The yuan’s exchange rate has no direct link with China’s
trade surplus, He wrote. The U.S. should shoulder the main
responsibility for rebalancing the global economy instead of
“blaming” China, He wrote.  
 China and the world’s other major economies should work
together to ensure the basic stability of the dollar, the euro,
the yen, the pound and the yuan, He wrote.  
 The People’s Daily newspaper is published by China’s
Communist Party.
