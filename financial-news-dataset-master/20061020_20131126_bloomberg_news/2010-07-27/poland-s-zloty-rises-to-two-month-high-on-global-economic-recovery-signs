             The Polish zloty advanced to the
strongest level in more than two months as signs of economic
recovery bolstered demand for riskier assets.  
 The zloty appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 4.0035 per
euro, the strongest intraday level since May 18, and traded 0.5
percent higher to 4.0086 per euro as of 12:26 p.m. in Warsaw.  
 European stocks rose for a sixth day as UBS AG and Deutsche
Bank AG reported earnings that beat estimates the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision softened some of its proposed
capital rules. German  consumer confidence  will rise in August
after economic growth accelerated, unemployment dropped and the
country placed well in the soccer World Cup, GfK AG said.
Germany is the biggest market for Polish exports.  
 “The recent economic reports and the results of stress
tests have reduced the uncertainty,” said Cezary Chrapek, a
currency and bond market analyst at Citigroup Inc.’s Warsaw
unit. “The monthly data from Poland are also signaling the
recovery is picking up pace and that’s zloty-positive.”  
 Poland’s economy, the only one in the European Union to
avoid contraction through the credit crisis, probably grew in
the second quarter by a rate similar to the 3 percent posted in
the January to March period and to the 3.3 percent from the last
three months of 2009,  Halina Dmochowska , deputy head of the
country’s Statistics Office, said on July 23. A report on the
same day showed June  retail sales  grew at an annual pace of 6.4
percent, the fastest in four months.
