             Kabel Deutschland GmBH ended takeover
talks with Tele Columbus GmBH, the German cable company seeking
to restructure $1.2 billion of debt, two people familiar with
the situation said.  
 KDG, Germany’s biggest cable company, abandoned the
acquisition of its smaller rival after deciding it wasn’t worth
the 600 million euros its owners sought to raise, according to
one of the people, who declined to be identified because
discussions are private.  
 “We are still interested in these assets and other
similar assets that are in our footprint,” said  Marco Gassen , a
spokesman for Unterfoehring-based KDG.  
 Tele Columbus has offered lenders equity in exchange for
writing down debt to 623 million euros from 947 million euros,
the person said. Tele Columbus’s creditors led by York Capital
Management LLC, Bank of Ireland Plc and GoldenTree Asset
Management LP, agreed to freeze loan payments earlier this year.  
 Nikolaus & Co.,  a restructuring specialist in Dusseldorf,
Germany, took control of Hannover-based Tele Columbus in January
and started talks with lenders to reduce its debt to make it
more attractive to bidders.  
 Tele Columbus, formerly a unit of Orion Cable GmBH, may
participate in consolidating cable networks in former East
Germany, managing director Dietmar Schickel said in a statement.  
 “Meetings with various parties have been held to consider
all future options,” Tele Columbus said in a statement, without
elaborating on the outcome of the discussions.
