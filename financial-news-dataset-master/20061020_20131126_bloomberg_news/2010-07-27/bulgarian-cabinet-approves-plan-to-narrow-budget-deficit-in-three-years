             Bulgaria’s government approved its
three-year budget outlook aimed at narrowing the deficit to 1
percent of gross domestic product in 2013 as economic growth
accelerates.  
 The economy will expand 3.6 percent next year, 4.7 percent
in 2012 and 4.9 percent in 2013, the government in Sofia said
today in a statement. GDP shrank 5.1 percent in 2009 and the
government expects it to grow 1 percent this year.  
 The  European Commission , the EU’s executive arm, has given
Bulgaria until the end of next year to bring the shortfall
within the EU’s limit of 3 percent of GDP. Prime Minister Boiko
Borissov’s Cabinet, which took office a year ago, must trim the
deficit, which is estimated to widen to 3.8 percent in 2010
because the recession and low demand eroded revenue.  
 The government plans to freeze public-sector wages and
pensions and to keep state spending to 40 percent of GDP,
according to the document. The budget gap is seen at 2.5 percent
of GDP next year and 1.5 percent in 2012. The full draft budget
for 2011 will be submitted to Parliament in September after it
is debated by the Cabinet and state agencies.  
 European Union harmonized average inflation is expected to
be 3.6 percent in 2011, 3.5 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in
2013, the document said.  
 The commission estimates Bulgaria’s economy will grow 1
percent next year, while a Standard and Poor’s forecast on July
21 forecasts growth at 2.5 percent in 2011.
