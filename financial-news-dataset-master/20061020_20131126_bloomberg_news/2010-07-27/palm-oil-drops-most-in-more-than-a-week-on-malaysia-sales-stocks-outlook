             Palm oil dropped the most in more
than a week on concern that lower exports from Malaysia, the
world’s second-biggest producer, may increase stockpiles this
month for the first time in 2010.  
 October-delivery futures fell 1.6 percent to 2,434 ringgit
($763) a metric ton, the biggest intraday drop since July 19,
and paused at 2,444 ringgit at the midday break on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange.  
 “Exports have been lukewarm so far this month and there’s
speculation that inventory in Malaysia may increase,” said
 Arhnue Tan , an analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn. “There’s
weakness across the oilseed complex today and that’s reflecting
in palm oil prices as well.”  
 Exports from Malaysia dropped 4.1 percent in the first 25
days of July to 1,074,329 tons from the same period in June,
surveyor Intertek said yesterday. Shipments fell 0.9 percent to
1,103,439 tons, rival Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  
 An increase in Malaysian palm oil stockpiles this month
would be the first gain since December, according to data from
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Stockpiles fell to a 10-month low
of 1.45 million tons in June, the board said July 12. Shipments
advanced 5.5 percent to 1.44 million tons last month, it said.  
 Palm oil has climbed 8.6 percent in the past two weeks on
speculation demand may rise among Asian countries and as weather
threatens to disrupt production in the biggest producers of the
tropical commodity.  
 Festive Demand  
 “Demand has been less than expected and buyers may step up
purchase from next month,” ECM Libra’s Tan said. “The recent
gains in prices may be holding back buyers a bit.”  
 China, India, Pakistan and Indonesia mark their important
festivals in the quarter ending September, with communal meals
stoking edible oils consumption.  
 December-delivery soybean oil lost as much as 0.5 percent
to 39.38 cents a pound and the vegetable oil’s  premium  over palm
oil widened to $103.95 a ton from $99 yesterday, according to
Bloomberg data.  
 CME Group Inc.’s October-delivery palm oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark price, lost 0.5 percent to $773.5 a
ton yesterday.  
 On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, January-delivery palm oil
tumbled as much as 1.6 percent to 6,568 yuan ($969) a ton, while
soybean oil dropped as much as 0.9 percent to 7,582 yuan a ton.
