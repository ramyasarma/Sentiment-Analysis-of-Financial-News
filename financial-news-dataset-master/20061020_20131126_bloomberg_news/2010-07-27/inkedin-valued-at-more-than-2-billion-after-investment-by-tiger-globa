             Tiger Global Management LLC, a hedge
fund founded by Chase Coleman, paid $20 million for a stake in
LinkedIn Corp., valuing the professional-networking website at
more than $2 billion, said two people familiar with the matter.  
 The purchase, at $21.50 a share for about a 1 percent
stake, was from existing shareholders and doesn’t represent new
investment, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the sale has not been disclosed. LinkedIn,
based in  Mountain View ,  California , is closely held.  
 Hedge funds, private-equity firms and mutual-fund
companies, facing a dearth of initial public offerings, are
taking bigger stakes in private technology companies to benefit
when they go public. Tiger’s investment follows its December
purchase of shares in Zynga Game Network Inc., another Internet
company that like LinkedIn is a candidate for an IPO.  
 “It’s relatively low risk for these companies to buy pre-
IPO and gives them the benefit that generally they’re going to
trade up,” said Ted Hollifield, a partner at law firm  Dorsey &
Whitney LLP , who works with venture capital firms and startups.  
 Coleman declined to comment, as did LinkedIn spokeswoman
Krista Canfield.  
 According to  SharesPost Inc. , an online marketplace for
privately held companies, LinkedIn has 105 million shares
outstanding. The purchase price of $21.50 a share values the
company at $2.26 billion.  
 From the start of 2008 through June, there were 44 venture-
backed IPOs, about half the number in 2007 alone, according to
the  National Venture Capital Association . Over that stretch,
more than 800 startups were acquired, the group said.  
 LinkedIn Valuation  
 LinkedIn has more than 70 million members who use the site
to hunt for jobs, recruit employees and connect with industry
experts. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Weiner said in an
interview last month that LinkedIn is fielding inquiries from
bankers interested in the company, without identifying which
firms or saying whether an IPO is forthcoming.  
 In 2008, LinkedIn raised $76 million in funding from
investors, including Bain Capital Ventures. The sum remains in
the bank, Weiner said.  
 “We don’t need the capital,” he said. Other  investors 
include  Sequoia Capital  and  Greylock Partners .  
 Coleman was previously a technology analyst at  Julian Robertson ’s Tiger Management LLC, where he worked from 1997
until 2000, the year Robertson closed his $6 billion fund to
outside investors. Tiger Global, based in  New York , was seeded
by Robertson.  
 Tiger Global’s investment in Zynga was part of a $180
million investment led by Russian firm Digital Sky Technologies,
which has also invested in  Facebook . Last year, T. Rowe Price
Group Inc. invested in Twitter Inc.
