             Ukrainian trade unions are asking
the nation’s courts to block the government’s effort to double
natural gas prices, a key component of the deficit-reduction
plan under review by the  International Monetary Fund .  
 Unions have filed three actions with the Kiev city
administrative court, which will hear the first case Sept. 16,
officials from the National Forum of Trade Unions said at a news
conference today in Kiev. A similar move by the unions last year
delayed the disbursement of funds from the IMF.  
 “Most of Ukraine’s trade unions have protested the
government’s price increase through the courts,” said
Vyacheslav Roy, head of the union that represents workers at
small and mid-size companies. “We want tariff increases to be
proportional with wages.”  
 The government said July 14 it would raise the price
households and utilities pay for gas to reduce losses at state-
owned energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy and qualify for a new
$14.9 billion loan from the IMF. The Washington-based lender’s
board will decide on the loan tomorrow.  
 Ukraine has agreed to cut its budget deficit to 4.99
percent of gross domestic product this year after it ballooned
as economy contracted 15.1 percent in 2009. Naftogaz will have a
deficit of 10 billion hryvnia ($1.27 billion) this year,
compared with 30 billion hryvnia in 2009, Deputy Prime Minister
 Serhiy Tigipko  said July 14.  
 Subsidies Promised  
 The government has promised to provide subsidies to poor
people to help them pay for increased energy costs.  
 “We have to provide all subsidies to compensate for tariff
increases by Sept. 1 as agreed with IMF,” Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said today at a news conference. “If subsidy allocation
is done wisely, the increase will be unnoticed by most people.”  
 The unions today called for improvements to ensure
efficient delivery of compensation and demanded that workers
receive all back pay they are owed before the prices increases
take effect. Wage arrears nationwide reached 1.79 billion
hryvnia as of July 1, according to the state statistics office.  
 The National Commission for Energy Regulation increased the
gas price households will pay from Aug. 1 to 725 hryvnia per
1,000 cubic meters for annual use of less than 2,500 cubic
meters and 1,098 hryvnia ($91.83) per 1,000 cubic meters for use
less than 6,000 cubic meters, according to its Web site.  
 Naftogaz paid $230 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of
Russian gas in the second quarter. Ukraine will pay Russia $269
per 1,000 cubic meters this quarter and $289 in the fourth
quarter, Azarov told reporters today. Local prices have to
“comply with the market price,” he said.  
 The World Bank said in March that Ukraine needs a large
initial increase in prices followed by gradual increase so that
population pays “fair price.”  
 The Kiev administrative court in February annulled a June
2009 resolution by the energy commission that proposed a 20
percent increase in gas prices at the end of 2009, followed by
20 percent increases each quarter 2010 because the resolution
wasn’t coordinated with trade unions, according to  Kommersant-
Ukraine  newspaper.
