             Agility ’s U.S. subsidiary may be
dropped from a criminal case accusing the Kuwaiti logistics
company of overbilling the military after prosecutors sought to
dismiss the charges against the unit.  
 The request pertains only to Agility DGS Holdings Inc. and
not to any other defendant, federal prosecutors in Atlanta said
yesterday in a court filing. The revised indictment filed in
February names as the two other defendants the parent company,
Public Warehousing Co., or Agility, and its Agility DGS
Logistics Services subsidiary.  
 “This request comes after motions filed by Agility DGS
Holdings to discover the government’s evidence against it,”
Agility said today in an e-mailed statement. “This case is, at
most, a civil contract dispute over the interpretation of a
contract drafted by the government.”  
 Assistant U.S. Attorney  Barbara Nelan  didn’t immediately
return a call to her office after regular business hours.  
 The company was first indicted in November on allegations
it overcharged the U.S. government on a multibillion-dollar
contract to supply food for troops in Kuwait and Iraq.  
 The case is U.S. v. Public Warehousing Co., 09-cr-490, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta).
