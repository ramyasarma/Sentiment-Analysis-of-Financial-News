             Trading of bullish  Western Union Co. 
options jumped to a three-month high as investors boosted wagers
the world’s biggest money-transfer business will rally after
reporting more profit than analysts estimated.  
 More than 13,700 calls to buy the stock changed hands, 6.6
times the four-week average and seven times the number of puts
to sell, as the stock rose 0.1 percent to $16.69 at 4 p.m. New
York time. Most of the volume was concentrated in November
$17.50 calls, which changed hands 12,179 times. There were
12,036 of those contracts in existence before today.  
 “It looks like investors are adding to those existing
positions in expectation of a catalyst to move the shares higher
from now through mid-November,” said  Frederic Ruffy , senior
options strategist at  WhatsTrading.com , a New York-based
provider of options-market analysis. “They might have wanted to
wait until after the earnings release to avoid the risk of an
adverse move around the report.”  
 The stock hasn’t closed above $17.50 since May 5.  
 Western Union reported second-quarter profit excluding some
items of 36 cents a share, beating the average  analyst  estimate
of 32 cents in a Bloomberg survey. The Englewood, Colorado-based
company also reduced its earnings and sales forecasts for this
year because high unemployment rates in some of its markets cuts
demand for money transfers.
