             Money manager  Kenneth I. Starr  seeks
court permission to post $2 million bail and live at his
Manhattan apartment while awaiting trial on charges he defrauded
his celebrity and socialite clients of at least $59 million.  
 Starr, 66, would be in the custody of his wife, Diane
Passage, and would wear an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet,
according to a request filed in federal court in New York by his
lawyer,  Flora Edwards . Starr would be under curfew from 6 p.m.
to 8 a.m., according to yesterday’s filing.  
 In detention, Starr hasn’t been able to help in his defense
because he “lacks access to the multitude of files and records
as well as the technology necessary to work effectively,”
Edwards said in the filing. The $2 million will be secured in
collateral pledged by Starr’s brothers, Warren Starr and Stuart
Starr, according to the filing.  
 Starr is charged with 20 counts of wire fraud and one each
of securities fraud, money laundering and fraud by an investment
adviser. Starr was arrested May 27 and accused of defrauding
clients, including heiress Rachel “Bunny” Mellon, in a scheme
to buy a $7.5 million Manhattan apartment. He has denied the
charges.  
 U.S. prosecutors objected to Starr’s bail request.  
 The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan argued Starr
presents an “extraordinary risk of flight” because he faces as
long as 445 years in prison, his ties to the community have been
eroded, and his family “continues to be willing to make
millions of dollars of assets available to him,” according to
the government’s filing.  
 The case is U.S. v. Starr, 1:10-cr-00520, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
