             U.K. Business Secretary  Vince Cable 
clashed with Prime Minister  David Cameron  by suggesting he would
press for changes to the government’s planned cap on immigration
from outside the European Union.  
 Speaking before he accompanied a Cameron-led delegation to
India, Cable, a Liberal Democrat in the U.K.’s coalition
government, told Indian journalists that he wants a “liberal”
immigration policy. Cameron’s Conservatives want an annual limit
on immigrant numbers.  
 “It’s no great secret that in my department and me
personally, we want to see an open economy, and as liberal an
immigration policy as it’s possible to have,” Cable said,
according to  Hindu Business Line . “We are arguing, within
government, about how we create the most flexible regime we can
possibly have, but in a way that reassures the British public.”  
 The U.K. has imposed a temporary limit on immigration while
it considers at what level an annual cap from non-EU countries
should be set. Conservative Home Secretary  Theresa May , whose
party is the senior partner in the coalition, said June 28 she
hopes the measures will eventually bring net migration down to
the levels of the 1990s.  
 India’s Commerce and Industry minister  Anand Sharma  has
warned the quota could hit Indian doctors, nurses and engineers
seeking employment in the U.K.  
 Cameron’s spokesman  Steve Field  told reporters in Ankara
that the government is consulting on the level of the cap.
