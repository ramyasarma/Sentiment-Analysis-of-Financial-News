             Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in four days, led by commodity producers, after U.S.
consumer confidence dropped to a five-month low.  
 Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, decreased
3.9 percent as the precious metal dropped for a third day. Bank
of Nova Scotia, Canada’s  third-largest bank , rose 1.6 percent
after an international panel softened some of its capital and
liquidity rules. BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Ltd.
declined 3.6 percent after MKM Partners analyst  Tero Kuittinen 
said in a note that rival Motorola Inc. has the two best-selling
smartphones at RIM carrier partner Verizon Communications Inc.  
 The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index slipped 29.38
points, or 0.3 percent, to 11,716.69 after rising as much as 0.7
percent earlier.  
 “It look like it turned on the consumer confidence
number,” said  Greg Eckel , who helps manage C$900 million ($869
million) as a money manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates Ltd.
in Toronto. “We’re still a little bit sensitive, and it doesn’t
take much to sway one way or the other. People are still
skittish.”  
 The S&P 500 has  outgained  the S&P/TSX 8.1 percent to 3.7
percent this month as a drop in gold prices has partially offset
the impact of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings. Gold
companies make up 10 percent of Canadian stocks by market value,
according to Bloomberg data.  
 Confidence Slips  
 The U.S. Conference Board’s index of  consumer confidence 
fell to 50.4 from a revised 54.3 in June. Economists had
forecast a drop to 51, according to the median of 73 estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  
 The  S&P/TSX Gold Index  declined to a three-month low as
gold futures lost 2.1 percent. The metal slipped as the euro
reached a two-month high against the U.S. dollar and rallies in
European equities diminished the appeal of hard assets.  
 Barrick decreased 3.9 percent to C$41.44. Goldcorp Inc.,
Canada’s second-largest gold producer, retreated 3.4 percent to
C$40.19. Iamgold Corp., which mines in  South America, Canada and
Africa , slumped 4.5 percent to C$15.98.  
 Producers of other commodities fell as oil and copper
prices dropped.  
 Cenovus Energy Inc., Canada’s sixth-largest energy company
by market value, lost 1 percent to C$30.47 as crude futures
decreased the most in three weeks. Teck Resources Ltd., the
country’s biggest base-metals and coal producer, retreated 2.7
percent to C$35.90 as copper ended a six-day streak of gains.  
 BlackBerry 6  
 RIM, Canada’s largest technology company, tumbled 3.6
percent to C$55.15. Traders are speculating the company’s
planned BlackBerry 6 operating system may be delayed, analyst
 Shaw Wu  of Kaufman Brothers LP said in a phone interview. RIM
didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  
 Rogers Communications Inc. and CGI Group Inc. retreated
after releasing quarterly financial results.  
 Rogers, Canada’s largest wireless carrier, reported second-
quarter profit that beat the average of 16 analyst estimates by
16 percent. The company didn’t increase its forecast for the
rest of the year, which “suggests the company expects a
meaningful slowdown in growth” in the second half, Bank of
Montreal analyst  Tim Casey  told clients in a note.  
 The company , which also provides cable television and owns
media and sports properties, fell 1.5 percent to C$36.83.  
 CGI Group, Canada’s biggest computer-services provider,
sank 4.7 percent, the most in 14 months, to C$15.46 after its
third-quarter revenue trailed the average of  11 analyst
forecasts  by 3.7 percent.  
 Financials Rise  
 Financial companies rose after the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision agreed to allow certain assets, including
minority stakes in other financial firms, to count as capital.
Those changes may benefit Toronto-Dominion Bank, Scotiabank and
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,  Andre-Philippe Hardy , a
Royal Bank of Canada analyst, said in a note to clients.  
 Scotiabank, which owns a  36 percent stake  in money manager
CI Financial Corp., gained 1.6 percent to C$51.19. CIBC advanced
2.2 percent to C$70.15. Manulife Financial Corp., North
America’s third-largest insurer, climbed 4.4 percent to C$15.80.  
 Cameco Corp., the world’s second-largest uranium producer,
rallied 4.7 percent to C$26.97 as prices of the radioactive
element surged the most in 14 months, according to Ux Consulting
Co. Uranium One Inc., the producer that has agreed to a takeover
by Uranium Holding ARMZ, jumped 6.3 percent to C$2.87.
