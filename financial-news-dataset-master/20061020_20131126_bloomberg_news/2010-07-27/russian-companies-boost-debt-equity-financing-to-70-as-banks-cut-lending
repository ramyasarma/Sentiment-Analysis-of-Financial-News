             Russian companies from  Nomos Bank  to
 OAO Mobile TeleSystems  are depending more on debt and equity
markets for financing than at any time since 1999 as overseas
banks pare back loans to all but the safest borrowers.  
 Companies in Russia obtained 71 percent of their capital
funding from selling bonds and shares so far this year, up from
46 percent in the same period two years ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bonds accounted for 59 percent, up from
40 percent in 2008, the data show.  
 Underwriters are limiting lending beyond the largest and
most solvent Russian borrowers on concern regulators worldwide
will toughen bank reserve requirements after the global credit
crisis, said  Herbert Moos , deputy chairman at Moscow-based VTB
Group, Russia’s second-largest lender. Russian corporate bond
offerings amounted to $23.1 billion so far this year and share
sales accounted for $4.6 billion, compared with $11.6 billion
from syndicated loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “While some of the second-tier companies might be able to
get syndicated loans, other guys unable to do so will need to
turn either to the Russian banks or to domestic or international
bond markets,” said Blazej Dankowski, vice president for fixed-
income capital markets at Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. in
London.  
 Russian companies are likely to issue another $10 billion
to $12 billion of bonds on international markets this year and
borrow $10 billion in syndicated loans, Dankowski said.  
 Nomos Bank  
 Nomos Bank, a Moscow-based lender ranked three levels below
investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service at Ba3, sold $350
million of 8.75 percent bonds in April, after increasing the
size of the offering from an initial $260 million funding plan.
The bonds have rallied, cutting the yield to 8.624 percent from
as much as 10 percent last month, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  
 “I doubt that we could have raised such a large amount
from a syndicated loan,”  Alexei Tretyakov , director of the
financial markets department at Nomos Bank, said in a phone
interview yesterday. “The Eurobond market has rebounded from
the crisis much faster than the syndicated loans market.”  
 Nomos last took a syndicated loan in April 2008 when it
borrowed $135 million from a group of banks for one year with a
one-year extension at an annual interest rate 155 basis points,
or 1.55 percentage point, over the London interbank offered
rate.  
 MTS Bonds  
 Bonds sold by Mobile TeleSystems, Russia’s largest mobile
phone company, have rallied since their issue in June, lowering
the yield on the $750 million of 10-year securities to 6.993
percent from 8.625 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 MTS of Moscow has no plans to borrow through international
debt sales this year, Chief Financial Officer  Alexey Kornya  said
in an e-mailed response to questions. MTS “will only borrow in
rubles, either by selling bonds or raising loans, by the end of
the year,” Kornya said.  
 The Russian government’s 2020 dollar bond yields fell 1
basis point to 5.001 percent today, down from a high of 6.068
percent on May 25. The extra yield investors demand to hold
Russian debt rather than U.S. Treasuries rose 1 to 230, compared
with 150 for debt of similarly rated Mexico and 198 for Brazil,
which is rated two steps lower at Baa3 by Moody’s, according to
JPMorgan EMBI+ indexes.  
 The  yield  spread on Russian bonds is 48 basis points below
the average for emerging markets, down from a 15-month high of
105 in February, according to JPMorgan.  
 Default Swaps  
 Credit-default swaps linked to Russian debt fell 1 basis
point to 160.17 on July 27, the lowest since May 13. The
contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on debt
or speculate on creditworthiness, pay the buyer face value if a
borrower reneges on its obligations.  
 Russian credit-default swaps cost 1 basis point less than
contracts for Turkey, which is rated four levels lower at Ba2 by
Moody’s Investors Service. That  difference  has narrowed from 40
basis points on April 20.  
 The ruble closed 0.2 percent weaker at 30.2598 per dollar,
falling from its strongest closing level since May 14. Non-
deliverable forwards, or NDFs, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow foreign
investors and companies to fix the exchange rate at a specific
level in the future, showed the ruble at 30.4400 per dollar in
three months.  
 The yield on ruble bonds sold by OAO Gazprom, Russia’s
biggest company, is 242 basis points above the same-maturity
Gazprom debt in dollars, down from a yield difference of 600 a
year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread narrowed
to as little as 115 on June 14.  
 Rising Loans  
 Syndicated loans to Russian companies soared 100-fold from
2001 to a peak of $84.5 billion in 2007 when international banks
were competing for market share in an economy growing at more
than 8 percent a year as oil rallied, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The economy suffered its worst slump since 1998
last year as investors avoided riskier assets after the 2008
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  
 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which
represents central banks and regulators in 27 nations, agreed on
July 26 to set a leverage ratio for banks globally, which may be
binding by 2018. The committee is still working on rules for
minimum capital requirements as it moves to rein in risk-taking.  
 European banks may halve loan growth over the next two
years from 7.5 percent since 2001 as stricter rules on capital
hurt earnings, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote June
9.  
 “The shift is probably driven by the much tougher
regulatory regime Western banks are facing,” VTB’s Moos said in
an e-mailed response yesterday to questions. “Carrying out any
capital-intensive business like bilateral or syndicated lending
will be penalized by the new regulatory regime. Any lending, any
leverage now has a real, much higher cost to banks.”
