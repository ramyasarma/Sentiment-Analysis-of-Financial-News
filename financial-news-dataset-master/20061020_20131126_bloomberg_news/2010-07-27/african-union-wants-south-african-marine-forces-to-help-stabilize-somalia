             The African Union asked South Africa
to provide marine security to help efforts to restore peace in
 Somalia , where a civil war has been raging for the past two
decades.  
 The continental body requested the support to complement a
peacekeeping force that controls parts of the Somali capital,
Mogadishu, James Mugume, permanent secretary in Uganda’s Foreign
Ministry, said in an interview today in Kampala, the Ugandan
capital. African leaders are meeting in Kampala for a three-day
summit that ends today.  
 “We are trying to interest them,” Mugume said. “The AU is
engaging them.”  
 Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the overthrow of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in
1991. Since 2007, the country’s Western-backed government has
been battling Islamist militias including al-Shabaab, which the
U.S. accuses of having links to al-Qaeda.  
 Yesterday,  AU  leaders endorsed plans by the Inter-
Governmental Authority on Development that groups East African
countries, to send an additional 2,000 soldiers Somalia, Mugume
said. An AU-led peacekeeping force in the country is currently
comprised of 2,700 Ugandan soldiers and 2,550 Burundian troops,
according to the website of the Francophone Research Network on
Peace Operations.
