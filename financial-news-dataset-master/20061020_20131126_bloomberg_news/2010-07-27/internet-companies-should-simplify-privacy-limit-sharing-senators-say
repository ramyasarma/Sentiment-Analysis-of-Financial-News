             Internet companies should simplify
their privacy policies and give computer users more power to
limit sharing of personal information, U.S. senators said.  
 Often online privacy policies aren’t read by consumers
because they don’t understand them and don’t realize that
websites are tracking their browsing, Senator  Mike Johanns , a
Nebraska Republican, said today.  
 “I don’t think this is what people are signing up for”
when they use the Internet, Johanns said at a Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee hearing.  
 Lawmakers are considering whether legislation is needed
following several recent web-privacy controversies.  Google Inc. ,
owner of the world’s most popular search engine, has been
criticized by U.S. lawmakers and European regulators for what
the company said was inadvertent information gathering from
unsecured wireless networks.  
 Concerns about privacy helped land Facebook Inc. in the
bottom 5 percent of a recent customer satisfaction survey. In
May the company simplified privacy settings to make it easier
for people to protect personal data after an outcry over the
original settings.  
 Senator  Jay Rockefeller , the commerce committee chairman,
said Internet companies constantly track what sites consumers
visit and which ads they click on.  
 “Can consumers demand the same degree of anonymity on the
Internet that they have in a shopping mall,” said Rockefeller,
a West Virginia Democrat.  
 Company Testimony  
 Privacy executives at Google, Facebook, Apple Inc. and AT&T
Inc. are scheduled to answer the committee’s questions later
today.  
 Companies should consider offering consumers a clear option
on whether they are willing to share health and bank records,
Federal Trade Commission Chairman  Jon Leibowitz  said.  
 Without more clarity, there may be “more interest in
Congress about more prescriptive rules,” he said.  
 In prepared remarks, company officials said they are
offering their customers more control over sharing personal
information.  
 “Users appreciate transparency and control,” said Alma
Whitten, a Google privacy official. “If we fail to offer clear,
usable privacy controls and strong security, our users will
simply leave.”
