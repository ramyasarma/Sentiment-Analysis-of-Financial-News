             MTU Aero Engines Holding AG , an
engine-making partner for Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner, raised
its full-year profit forecast as a stronger aircraft market
boosted second-quarter earnings.  
 MTU, which also builds engines for Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug
GmbH, increased its forecast for earnings before interest and
taxes to 310 million euros ($402 million) from 292 million
euros. Second-quarter net income gained 13 percent to 28 million
euros, the company said in a statement today.  
 The higher forecast came as “the market is picking up as
expected and we’re additionally benefiting from the tailwind of
the euro’s falling exchange rate against the U.S. dollar,”
Chief Executive Officer  Egon Behle  said in the statement. MTU’s
previous Ebit forecast called for an unchanged result compared
with 2009.  
 Boeing and  Airbus SAS , both MTU clients, won a combined 237
jetliner orders worth $28 billion at last week’s Farnborough
Airshow, more than three times the number announced at last
year’s show, which was held in Paris.  
 The stock gained 12 percent in the four trading days prior
to results, before falling as much as 4.7 percent in Frankfurt
today. MTU traded at 47.49 euros, down 4 percent, at 10:20 a.m.
local time, giving the company a market value of 2.5 billion
euros.  
 MTU Aero Engines was founded in 1969 through a merger of
the then  Daimler-Benz  and  MAN AG ’s engine operations.
