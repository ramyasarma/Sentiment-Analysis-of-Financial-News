             South Africa’s rand held gains
versus the dollar, even after a report showed the nation’s
unemployment rate rose in the second quarter.  
 The currency traded 0.1 percent stronger at 7.3448 as of
11:36 a.m. in Johannesburg, from a previous close of 7.3537.  
 South Africa’s jobless rate increased to 25.3 percent from
25.2 percent in the first quarter, Statistics South Africa said
in a report released in Pretoria today.
