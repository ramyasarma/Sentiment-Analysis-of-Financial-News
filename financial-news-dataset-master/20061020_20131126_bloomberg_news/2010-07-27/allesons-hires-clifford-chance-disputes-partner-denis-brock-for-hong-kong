             Mallesons Stephen Jaques  hired
commercial litigator  Denis Brock  from  Clifford Chance LLP  to
be a Hong Kong-based partner as the firm boosts its disputes
resolution and regulatory practices to meet client demand.  
 Brock, 48, said he’ll return to Hong Kong from London,
where he moved in 2006. He will join Mallesons’ 17-lawyer,
Hong Kong-based disputes and regulatory practice in October,
Tony O’Malley, a Sydney-based managing partner, said in a
phone interview.  
 Mallesons, based in Sydney, has more than 1,000 lawyers
in Australia and Asia, including 16 partners based in Hong
Kong. The firm advised Bank of China during an investigation
by Hong Kong regulators into the sale of minibonds, products
linked to the collapsed  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
Minibonds were custom-made securities linked to the
creditworthiness of companies and backed by collateralized-
debt obligations.  
 “Contentious advice has grown exponentially in the last
couple of years for us,” O’Malley said. “The increased
regulation of financial products and services has meant that
many of our banking and corporate clients that operate in
this space have increased demand for regulatory advice and
support.”  
 Brock, who is leaving Clifford Chance after 24 years
with the firm, acted for the Hong Kong government in
litigation over the proposed listing of the real estate
investment trust, Link R. The Court of Final Appeal ruled in
2005 that the initial public offering could proceed.
