             New Zealand picked  Joe Rokocoko  for
a national record 64th appearance on the wing for the July 31
Tri-Nations rugby Test against Australia, which also made two
changes for the match in Melbourne.  
 Rokocoko replaces Rene Ranger after recovering from a
hamstring strain and will move ahead of John Kirwan  and  Jonah Lomu  as the most-capped All Blacks winger. Jimmy Cowan comes in
at scrum-half for  Piri Weepu  in the other change from the team
that began the 31-17 win over South Africa on July 17.  
 Australia, which beat the Springboks 30-13 three days ago,
recalled  Berrick Barnes  at inside center and Stephen Moore at
hooker.  Matt Giteau  moved in one place in the backline to fly-
half in place of the suspended Quade Cooper.  
 New Zealand, which is on a seven-game winning streak
against the Wallabies, tops the Tri-Nations standings with 10
points, six more than Australia. The defending champion
Springboks have no points following three straight losses.
