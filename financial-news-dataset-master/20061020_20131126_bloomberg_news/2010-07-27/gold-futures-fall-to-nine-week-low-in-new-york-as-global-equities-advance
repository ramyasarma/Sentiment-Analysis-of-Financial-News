             Gold fell to the lowest price in
three months as a rally in global equities eroded demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  
 Stocks in Asia and Europe rallied, while the fourth
straight gain by the Dow Jones Industrial Average was enough to
erase the index’s loss for the year. Gold has slumped by more
than $100 since reaching a record $1,266.50 an ounce on June 21.  
 “The risk trade is back on,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals
trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “Investors right
now are seeking higher returns, and gold doesn’t fit the bill.”  
 Gold futures for December delivery fell $25.20, or 2.1
percent, to $1,161.80 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
lowest settlement for a most-active contract since April 26. The
price still is up 6 percent this year.  
 Losses accelerated after the price fell below the 100-day
moving average around $1,181, a key area of resistance.  
 “Gold is finally succumbing to its wounds,” Zeman said.
“I have gold positions that I’m looking to exit.”  
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded fund backed by bullion, dropped to 1,301.74 metric tons
yesterday. Assets under management have fallen 1.4 percent this
month, heading for the first decline since February.  
 No Technical Support  
 “With the disappearance of technical support for the gold
market, it appears likely that traders may move to the sidelines
and liquidate, rather than hold on to lingering expectations of
the need for safe haven,” said  Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF
Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.  
 The euro was little changed against the dollar, after
touching $1.3046, the highest level since May 10. Gold reached
all-time highs in euros last month on concern some governments
in Europe would struggle to pay back sovereign debt.  
 Silver futures for September delivery fell 57.4 cents, or
3.2 percent, to $17.626 an ounce on the Comex, the lowest
closing price since July 19.  
 Platinum futures for October delivery slipped $19.10, or
1.2 percent, to $1,536.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Palladium futures for September delivery declined
$8.45, or 1.8 percent, to $466.55 an ounce on the Nymex.
