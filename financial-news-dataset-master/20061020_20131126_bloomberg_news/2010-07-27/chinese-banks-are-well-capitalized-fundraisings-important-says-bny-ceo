             China’s banks are “well
capitalized” and efforts by lenders to raise more capital are
“important in this environment,” Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Robert P. Kelly said.  
 A joint venture fund management company between BNY Mellon
and Western Securities Co., a brokerage based in Xi’an, China,
will be “up and running” this year, he said at a briefing in
Shanghai.
