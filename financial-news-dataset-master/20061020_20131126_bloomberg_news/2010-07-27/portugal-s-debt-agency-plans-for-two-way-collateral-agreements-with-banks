             Portugal’s debt agency said it plans
to post collateral to the commercial banks it trades derivatives
with for the first time.  
 Making the collateral agreements, known as credit support
annexes, bilateral protects both parties in a trade against the
risk of the other defaulting. Most governments currently require
banks to put up collateral against losses, without
reciprocating.  
 “We are working on bilateral CSAs,” debt agency President
 Alberto Soares  said in a phone interview from Lisbon.  
 The story was earlier reported on website Risk.net.  
 Along with its southern European neighbours, Portugal has
been struggling with a spiralling budget deficit and investor
concern the government would struggle to pay its debts. The
nation said July 2 that it’s bringing forward by a year a plan
to cut its budget shortfall to within the European Union’s 3
percent limit. Portugal’s deficit reached 9.3 percent of gross
domestic product last year.  
 Derivatives are financial instruments derived from stocks,
bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to specific
events like changes in interest rates or the weather. So-called
over-the-counter derivatives aren’t traded on exchanges.
