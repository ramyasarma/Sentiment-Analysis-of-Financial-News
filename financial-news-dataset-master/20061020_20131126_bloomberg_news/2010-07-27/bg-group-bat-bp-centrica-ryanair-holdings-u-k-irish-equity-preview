             U.K. stocks declined the most in
more than a week after results at Rexam Plc and Yell Group Plc
disappointed investors and orders for U.S. durable goods
unexpectedly decreased.  
 Invensys Plc led falling shares on the benchmark  FTSE 100
Index  after the engineering company announced a provision on its
rail business. Rexam, the world’s biggest beverage-can maker,
slid 3.7 percent after sales fell in the first half. Yell Group
tumbled 19 percent.  
 The FTSE 100 lost 45.99, or 0.9 percent, to 5,319.68 at the
close of trading at 4:30 p.m. in London. The gauge has fallen
8.7 percent from this year’s high on April 15 amid concern that
growth in the U.S. and China is slowing and that austerity
measures from European governments will hurt the recovery in the
region. The  FTSE All-Share Index  declined 0.9 percent and
Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  retreated 1.1 percent today.  
 “U.S. durable goods orders for June were the latest set of
economic data to disappoint,” said Michael Hewson, an analyst
at CMC Markets in London. “Given the recent propensity for U.S.
economic data to disappoint there is the possibility that
Friday’s figure could well fall short of the consensus forecast
of 2.5 percent” for gross domestic product growth.  
 Goods Orders  
 Orders for U.S. goods meant to last at least three years
dropped 1 percent in June, depressed by a less demand for
aircraft, Commerce Department figures showed. The data, which
followed a bigger-than-forecast drop in consumer confidence
yesterday, adds to evidence that the economic recovery is
slowing. The Commerce Department is scheduled to report U.S. GDP
for the second quarter on July 30.  
 Invensys lost 4.7 percent to 279.1 pence after it announced
a 13 million-pound ($20.3 million) charge to its rail business.  
 “Rail will take a 13 million pound hit,” Evolution
Securities Ltd. analyst  Harry Philips  wrote in a note to
clients. He cut his earnings estimate for the company by 13
million pounds to 272 million pounds.  
 Rexam retreated 3.7 percent to 327.6 pence as sales fell 1
percent to 2.49 billion pounds in the first half of the year.  
 “Visibility is still low largely because of the
uncertainty about the global economy,” Chief Executive Officer
 Graham Chipchase  said in a phone interview today.  
 Yell Group tumbled 19 percent to 24.5 pence after the
publisher of the U.K.’s Yellow Pages directories said net income
in the three months through June fell to 11.1 million pounds
from 14.9 million pounds a year earlier.  
 CSR, Brit  
 CSR Plc  slumped 14 percent to 355.5 pence, its biggest fall
since May 2008, as the maker of microchips used in Nokia Oyj
mobile phones forecast lower sales in the second half of 2010
than analysts had estimated.  
 Brit Insurance Holdings NV soared 10 percent to 1,005
pence, the highest level since April 2008. The U.K insurer that
sponsors the England cricket team granted Apollo Global
Management permission to review its books after the private
equity firm increased its offer for the company.  
 EasyJet Plc lost 7.1 percent to 403.6 pence after  Carolyn McCall  said in her first comments as chief executive officer
that she’s “looking at all assumptions” concerning crew levels
and rostering as staff shortages at bases including Gatwick
prompt a decline in service punctuality. Flight delays at
London’s Gatwick airport are her most immediate concern after
joining Europe’s second-biggest discount airline four weeks ago,
she said.
