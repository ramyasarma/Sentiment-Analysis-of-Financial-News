             Cantor Fitzgerald LP and the former
head of its carbon credits brokerage settled a lawsuit involving
a $2 million loan and an unfair dismissal claim.  
 Both sides reached a confidential agreement to end the
week-old trial, Cantor lawyer Paul Nicholls told trial judge
 Michael Burton  at a hearing today.  
 Cantor sued Stephen Drummond, a former executive at
 CantorCO2e , in London for the return of the money it says it
loaned him while he was running the unit. Drummond countersued,
claiming he was wrongfully dismissed in 2009 for failing to tell
the company he was in talks with a competitor about a job.  
 Nicholls told the judge that Drummond’s employment claim
had been dropped and an agreement had been reached over the
$2 million.  
 Drummond, who was at court, declined to comment after the
hearing.  
 The cases are: Cantor Fitzgerald LP v. Stephen Drummond and
Stephen Drummond v. CantorCO2e Limited.
