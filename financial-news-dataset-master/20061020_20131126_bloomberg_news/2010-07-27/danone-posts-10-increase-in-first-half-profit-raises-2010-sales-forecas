             Groupe Danone SA , the world’s
biggest yogurt maker, reported higher profit in the first half
as it sold more Aqua water and Activia yogurt in markets such as
Indonesia and China.  
 Net income  from continuing operations rose to 848 million
euros ($1.1 billion) from 722 million euros a year earlier, the
Paris-based company said today. So-called organic sales, which
exclude acquisitions and currency swings, increased 7 percent.  
 The French company raised its sales growth target for the
year to at least 6 percent from 5 percent.  
 Danone gets more than 40 percent of its sales from emerging
markets, a higher proportion than bigger rival Nestle SA. Rising
incomes will create 2 billion new middle-class consumers in
those countries by 2025, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.  
 “The market is underestimating the earnings growth
potential from exposure to high-growth emerging markets,”
Alexis Colombo, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote before the
results. He rates the stock “buy.”  
 The maker of Actimel drinking yogurts said June 18 it will
combine its Russian dairy unit with OAO Unimilk to become the
biggest dairy company in that market. That will boost its
proportion of sales from emerging countries to 46 percent, the
company said.  
 Danone said June 18 it would inform investors if it starts
a share buyback and that the company could purchase as much as
500 million euros of stock.  
 Danone, whose products include the Activia brand, restored
sales-volume growth in the past year by offering cheaper goods
such as a range of 1-euro yogurts to gain customers during the
recession.  
 The  shares  have increased 8 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 30 billion euros.  
 Net income for the half fell to 838 million euros from 932
million euros.
