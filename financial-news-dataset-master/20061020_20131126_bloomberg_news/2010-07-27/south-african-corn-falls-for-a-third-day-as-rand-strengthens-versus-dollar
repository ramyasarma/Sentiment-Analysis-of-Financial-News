             Corn in South Africa, the largest
producer of the grain on the continent, fell for a third day as
the rand strengthened against the dollar, cutting the cost of
imports for local millers.  
 The rand traded at 7.3266 against the dollar at 12:09 p.m.
in Johannesburg, compared with 7.4034 at the close of grain
trading at noon yesterday. Corn also declined for three
consecutive days to $3.78 a bushel yesterday in Chicago.  
 White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, slipped 20 rand, or 1.7
percent, to 1,141 rand ($156) a metric ton. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  
 Yellow corn for September delivery dropped 20 rand, or 1.7
percent, to 1,135 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for
animal feed in South Africa. The U.S. and Argentina are the
world’s largest exporters of the grain.  
 Wheat for September delivery fell 18 rand, or 0.7 percent,
to 2,461 rand a ton. Morocco, Egypt and Algeria are Africa’s
largest wheat growers.  
 Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:  

 
             Today’s Price   Previous Close    % Change
Sunflowers       3,338          3,384            -1.4
