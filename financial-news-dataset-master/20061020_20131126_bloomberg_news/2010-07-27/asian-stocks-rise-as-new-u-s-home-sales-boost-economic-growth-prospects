             Asian  stocks  rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index higher for the third straight day, as better-
than-estimated U.S. home sales and earnings reports boosted
investor confidence.  
 James Hardie Industries SE , the biggest seller of home
siding in the U.S., jumped 2.9 percent in Sydney. HSBC Holdings
Plc, Europe’s largest bank, gained 1.4 percent after Swiss
lender UBS reported a third consecutive quarterly profit.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. rose 2.8 percent in Tokyo
on higher earnings at its investment-banking unit.  Singapore
Airlines Ltd.  rose 1.8 percent on better-than-estimated profit.  
 “Strong earnings and better economic news have reduced
fears of a double-dip recession,” said  Nader Naeimi , a Sydney-
based strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages
about $90 billion. “After a spate of worse than expected data
out of the U.S., the market is prepared to pay more attention to
good news.”  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 0.3 percent to 118.38 as
of 7:18 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure’s three-day winning streak is
the longest since an eight-day advance to June 21. The gauge has
slumped 8.3 percent from its high this year on April 15 on
concern Europe’s debt crisis and Chinese steps to curb property
prices will slow global economic growth.  
 Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 0.6 percent, while
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3 percent. Japan’s  Topix 
index gained less than 0.1 percent. China’s  Shanghai Composite
Index  lost 0.5 percent, led by banks on concern over rising
credit risks.  
 U.S. Sales  
 Futures on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 increased 0.5
percent. The gauge gained 1.1 percent yesterday after the report
on June home sales and after FedEx Corp., the second-largest U.S.
package-shipping company, boosted its profit forecast.  
 James Hardie  surged 2.9 percent to A$6.73. Nissan Motor Co.,
which gets a third of its revenue from North America, increased
0.8 percent to 634 yen.  Hyundai Motor Co. , which derives 14
percent of its sales in North America, advanced 2.5 percent to
143,500 won in Seoul.  
 New U.S. home purchases increased 24 percent from May to an
 annual pace  of 330,000, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for an advance of 3.3 percent to 310,000. A government report
later today will show U.S. durable goods orders gained 1 percent
from the previous month, after falling 0.6 percent in May,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  
 Lower Valuations  
 The home-sales data helped ease concerns the world’s
biggest economy is stalling. Sales at  U.S. retailers  declined in
June for a second month, the Commerce Department reported on
July 14. Home-builder confidence dropped this month to the
lowest level since April 2009, National Association of Home
Builders/Wells Fargo data on July 19 showed.  
 Speculation economic growth may falter dragged down the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index by as much as 9.6 percent this year,
cutting the  average  price of stocks in the gauge to the lowest
level since December 2008. The index’s companies now trade at
14.2 times estimated profit, compared with 13.5 times for the
 S&P 500 Index  and 11.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  
 In Hong Kong, HSBC climbed 1.7 percent to HK$78.85, while
Standard Chartered Plc, a British bank that makes most of its
profit in Asia, jumped 3 percent to HK$224.60.  
 Both stocks rallied during afternoon trading in Hong Kong
after UBS reported net income of 2.01 billion Swiss francs
($1.91 billion). That beat the 1.12 billion-franc median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  
 Basel Committee  
 Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s second-largest publicly traded
bank, gained 2.8 percent to 2,587 yen. Nikko Cordial Securities
Inc., the investment-banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui, said
first-quarter profit rose 24 percent on higher commissions and
trading activity.  
 Bank stocks also rose after the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision , which represents central banks and regulators in 27
nations and sets capital standards for banks worldwide, softened
capital rules proposed for lenders. The committee was asked by
Group of 20 leaders to draft rules in the aftermath of the
credit crisis.  
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Japan’s largest bank
by market value, rose 2.4 percent to 418 yen and Westpac Banking
Corp. climbed 2.4 percent to A$23.70 in Sydney.  
 “Relaxation of the regulations will remove remaining
concerns about further equity capital increases,”  Shinichi Ina ,
a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a
report dated today.  
 Singapore Air, the world’s second-largest carrier by market
value, gained 1.8 percent to S$15.02. The carrier’s first-
quarter net income of S$252.5 million ($186 million), beating
the S$162.4 million average analyst estimate compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 Seiko Epson, Kao  
 In Tokyo,  Seiko Epson Corp.  rose 4.4 percent to 1,156 yen
after the Nikkei newspaper said the printer maker may have
posted its first operating profit in two years in the first
quarter on rising demand for printers and electronic parts.  
 Kao Corp.  increased 1.1 percent to 2,111 yen after the
toiletry maker said net income for the quarter ended June 30
rose 5.7 percent, boosted by an increase in sales.  
 “Corporate earnings are good,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a
strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Companies
which reported strong earnings should be targets” for investors
to buy.  
 Chinese banks declined on speculation lenders may curb
lending to local governments. Banks may struggle to recoup about
23 percent of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) they’ve lent
to finance local infrastructure projects, according to a person
with knowledge of data collected by the China Banking Regulatory
Commission. China this year restricted borrowing on concern
money isn’t being used for viable projects.  
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd ., the nation’s
No.1 lender by market value, lost 1.2 percent to 4.28 yuan in
Shanghai. Bank of China Ltd. dropped 0.3 percent to 3.55 yuan.  
 China State Construction International Holdings Ltd. surged
5.7 percent to HK$3.32 in Hong Kong. Citigroup Inc. rated the
stock “buy” in  new coverage .

                          July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., talks with Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin about his investment strategy for Chinese banks. 
     Chinese banks may struggle to recoup about 23 percent of the 7.7 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) they’ve lent to finance local government infrastructure projects, according to a person with knowledge of data collected by the nation’s regulator. About half of all loans need to be serviced by secondary sources including guarantors because the ventures can’t generate sufficient revenue, the person said, declining to be identified because the information is confidential.
