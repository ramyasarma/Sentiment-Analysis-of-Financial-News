             Former Cuban President  Fidel Castro 
plans to release an autobiography next month about the years
leading up to his 1959 revolution, which ushered in five decades
of communist rule on the island.  
 The book, called “The Strategic Victory,” narrates
Castro’s early years in 25 chapters, including photos, maps and
illustrations of combat weapons, Castro  wrote  today in a
“Reflections” column published on the Cuba Debate website. He
didn’t say who will publish the book.  
 “I didn’t want to wait for others to eventually publish
the responses to the innumerable questions about my childhood,
adolescence and young adulthood, periods that turned me into a
revolutionary and armed combatant,” he wrote.  
 The book’s planned release comes as the 83-year-old Castro
returned to the public eye this month, giving his first
television interview in at least three years. Castro oversaw the
transfer of power to his brother Raul following his abdominal
surgery in 2006.  
 “I worked months on this project after my grave illness,
and now I’m excited to continue writing the sequel to this
story,” Castro wrote.  
 Castro appeared yesterday at the celebration of Cuba’s
Revolution Day, government newspaper  Granma  reported. The former
strongman, dressed in a military-style green shirt, called for a
meeting of Cuban leaders to discuss foreign affairs, including
the U.S. conflicts with Iran and North Korea, according to
Granma.
