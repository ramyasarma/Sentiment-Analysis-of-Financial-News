             Brazilian bank  lending  rose for the
16th straight month in June to a record high, led by loans made
by the state development bank, BNDES, and  mortgages .  
 State and non-state bank lending rose 19.7 percent from the
same month a year ago to 1.53 trillion reais ($870 billion), the
central bank said in a statement distributed today in Brasilia.
Lending climbed 2 percent from May, the bank said.  
 Credit rose to a record 45.7 percent of gross domestic
product, as mortgage loans rose 50.6 percent from a year ago to
111.6 billion reais, the bank said.  
 “Credit expansion maintained a vigorous pace in the
segment of directed credit, driven by BNDES’s performance and
continued expansion of housing loans,” the bank said in the
report.  
 Fueled by record levels of available credit this year,
domestic demand helped Latin America’s biggest economy expand at
the  fastest pace  since 1995 in the first quarter. Policy makers
last week reduced the pace of interest  rate increases  after
consumer  prices  fell for the first time in four years amid signs
that Brazil’s economic expansion is slowing.  
 The yield on the interest-rate future contract due in
January, the most traded in Sao Paulo, declined three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 10.86 percent, at 10:28
a.m. New York time. The real weakened 0.3 percent to 1.7681 per
dollar, from 1.7624 yesterday.
