             European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said any concerns that inflation could get
out of control are “entirely unfounded.”  
 “Suggestions that inflation might be unanchored are
entirely unfounded,” Trichet said at a hearing at the European
Parliament in Brussels today. “On the contrary, euro-area
inflation expectations appear to be remarkably well anchored in
line with our definition of price stability.”  
 The European debt crisis has prompted the ECB to reverse
its withdrawal of emergency stimulus measures and forced it to
start buying government bonds. Critics say the purchases amount
to bailing out indebted governments and could fuel inflation,
breaching two of the ECB’s founding principles and undermining
its credibility.  
 “Inflation is well contained,” Trichet said. “Given the
outlook for price stability and the solid anchoring of longer
term inflation expectations, the Governing Council regards our
monetary policy stance and the current level of key ECB interest
rates as appropriate.”
