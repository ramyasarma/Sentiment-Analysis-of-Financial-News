             China’s property loans should be
watched because the government has implemented intensive
policies to control the market after rapid gains in home prices,
the Securities Times reported, citing an unidentified official
with the China Banking Regulatory Commission.  
 The fluctuation period for home prices is long, the
Shenzhen-based newspaper cited the CBRC official as saying. Once
prices have settled, more consumers will buy homes, the report
cited the official as saying.
