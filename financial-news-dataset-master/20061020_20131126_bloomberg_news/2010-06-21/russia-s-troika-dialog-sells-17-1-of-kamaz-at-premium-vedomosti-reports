             Troika Dialog, Russia’s oldest
investment bank, sold 17.1 percent of commercial-vehicle maker
OAO KamAZ at a premium,  Vedomosti  reported.  
 Troika received about $428 million from Russian
Technologies, a state holding company, from Daimler AG and from
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; the
transactions valued KamAZ at about $2.5 billion, or 59 percent
more than its current market value, the newspaper said today,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  
 Russian Technologies bought 12.1 percent of KamAZ, boosting
its stake to 49.9 percent, Daimler bought 1 percent, increasing
its stake to 11 percent and the EBRD took 4 percent; Troika’s
stake has thus been reduced from 44.4 percent to 27.3 percent,
Vedomosti said.
