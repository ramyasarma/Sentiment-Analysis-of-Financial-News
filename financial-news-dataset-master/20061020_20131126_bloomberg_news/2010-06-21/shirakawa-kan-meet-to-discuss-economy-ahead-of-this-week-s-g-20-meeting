             Bank of Japan Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  said he discussed the economy with Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan  at their first meeting since Kan became leader.  
 “We exchanged opinions about economic conditions at home
and abroad and financial conditions ahead of the Group of 20”
summit this week, Shirakawa told reporters in Tokyo. Kan is
scheduled to attend the gathering of world leaders in Toronto.  
 Kan, who as former Prime Minister  Yukio Hatoyama ’s deputy
had pushed the central bank to do more to stamp out deflation,
didn’t make any policy requests at today’s gathering, according
to Shirakawa. The governor said he wants to meet with Kan every
three months.  
 Chief Cabinet Secretary  Yoshito Sengoku  and central bank
Deputy Governor  Hirohide Yamaguchi  were also present at the
gathering, according to the governor.
