             Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said he is hoping China’s plan for a more flexible
currency will ease pressure on the Canadian dollar.  
 “If we can spread the depreciation burden around the
world, that obviously would be helpful to the Canadian
economy,” Harper said in an interview with Bloomberg in Ottawa.  
 Asked if a revaluation of the yuan would ease pressure on
the dollar, Harper said: “That’s obviously something that we
would be hoping for, but the proof will be in the pudding.”
