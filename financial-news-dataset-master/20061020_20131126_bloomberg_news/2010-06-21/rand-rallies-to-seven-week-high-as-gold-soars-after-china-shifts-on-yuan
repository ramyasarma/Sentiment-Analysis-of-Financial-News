             The rand gained to a seven-week high
against the dollar as commodity prices rose after China signaled
it will allow its currency to strengthen, boosting prospects for
exports to the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  
 South Africa’s currency appreciated as much as 1.2 percent
to 7.4123 per dollar, the strongest since May 4, before trading
0.8 percent higher at 7.4623 by 12:44 p.m. in Johannesburg, from
a previous close of 7.5053.  
 The People’s Bank of China indicated yesterday it is
abandoning the yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global
crisis to shield exporters and will allow increased
“flexibility” in the exchange rate. Gold, which along with
platinum is South Africa’s biggest export, surged to record
levels in London and New York.  
 “The stronger yuan will give Chinese importers greater
purchasing power when buying South African export goods,”
 Michael Keenan , a currency strategist at  Standard Bank Group
Ltd.  in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note today. “A stronger
yuan bodes well for commodity prices.”  
 Gold advanced as much as 0.7 percent to $1,265.30 an ounce
in London and futures reached $1,266.50 in New York as investors
bought the precious metal as a hedge against financial
turbulence caused by Europe’s debt crisis. Platinum, which along
with gold accounts for about a fifth of South Africa’s exports,
climbed as much as 1.3 percent to $1,608.25 an ounce, the
highest since May 20.  
 Bonds, FRAs  
 Government bonds advanced in South Africa, with the
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 rising 19
cents to 123.64 rand. The yield on the bond fell 4 basis points
to 7.88 percent.  
 The rand strengthened versus half its 16 most-actively
traded counterparts monitored by Bloomberg, appreciating 0.5
percent against the euro to 9.2507.  
 Investors increased bets the central bank will reduce its
 benchmark rate  at 6.5 percent when it next meets on July 22,
forward-rate agreements show. The cost of  three-month contracts 
for cash in three months fell 1.5 basis points to 6.385 percent.
The rate reached a 6 1/2-year low of 6.36 percent on April 21.
