             China’s indication that it’s
abandoning its peg to the dollar and will allow more currency
flexibility is a “political signal,” Nobel Prize-winning
economist Robert Mundell said in Hong Kong today.  
 The move won’t help resolve global imbalances and isn’t a
good idea, said Mundell, an economics professor at Columbia
University.
