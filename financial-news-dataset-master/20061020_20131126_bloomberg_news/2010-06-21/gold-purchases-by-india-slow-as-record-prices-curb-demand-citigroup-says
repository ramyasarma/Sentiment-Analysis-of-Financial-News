             Gold imports by India, the world’s
biggest consumer, have slowed as higher prices cool demand for
jewelry, Citigroup Inc. said.  
 Purchases slumped to 16 to 17 metric tons in May, from 34
tons in April, Citigroup economists  Rohini Malkani  and Anushka
Shah wrote today in an e-mailed report.  
 Gold is set for a 10th straight annual increase, the longest
since at least 1920, as investors seeks to protect their wealth
on concern currencies will depreciate. Prices rose to a record
today, with bullion for immediate delivery reaching $1,265.30 an
ounce in London and futures touching $1,263.90 in New York.  
 “Import data indicates that the surge in gold prices
during May appear to be taking their toll,” the economists said
in the report. “Although jewelry demand is typically price
inelastic, the run-up in prices has begun to hurt consumption.”  
 August-delivery futures on India’s Multi Commodity Exchange
of India Ltd. shed 0.3 percent to 18,785 rupees per 10 grams at
12:55 p.m. Mumbai time. Domestic prices touched a record 19,198
rupees on June 8.  
 Domestic gold demand may be met by exchanging old jewelry
and melting down and remaking pieces if prices continue to rise,
Citigroup said. Consumers may also shift to costume or gold-
plated jewelry, the report said.  
 Jewelry accounts for about 75 percent of the nation’s gold
demand, according to the Citigroup report.
