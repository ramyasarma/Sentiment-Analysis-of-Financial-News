             The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index  fell for a second day, retreating 0.3 percent to
25,782.61 at the close in Lagos, data from the exchange’s
website show.  
 Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index  increased for a fifth day, rising
0.3 percent to 1,643.28. Kenya’s  All-Share Index  dropped 0.2
percent to 73.51, while Namibia’s  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index 
increased 1 percent to 774.91. The  Ghana Stock Exchange All-

 The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Afribank Plc  (AFRIBANK NL), a Nigerian lender bailed out
last year by the central bank, rose to its highest in 10 days,
gaining 9 kobo, or 4.6 percent. Net income for the three months
through March rose to 1.92 billion naira ($12.7 million)
compared with a year-earlier loss of 230 billion naira, the bank
said in a statement to the Lagos-based Nigerian Stock Exchange.  
 Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd.  (COOP KN), the country’s
fourth-biggest lender by assets, rose to the highest on record,
climbing 25 cents, or 1.7 percent, to 14.95 shillings on
speculation profit this year will exceed expectations, African
Alliance Kenya Securities Ltd. said. Profit may grow as much as
50 percent as the lender has focused on loans to companies
instead of individuals and cooperative societies, African
Alliance analyst  Francis Mwangi  said by phone from Nairobi.  
 Safaricom Ltd.  (SAFCOM KN), East Africa’s biggest mobile-
network operator, retreated 5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to 5.7
shillings. Mobile-phone owners in Kenya, where Safaricom
operates, need to register their devices and list their names
and personal details to help authorities track people who use
them to carry out offences, including kidnapping, theft, fraud
and hate crimes, the country’s Communications Commission said
today.  
 Spring Bank Plc  (SPRINGBK NL), a Nigerian lender bailed out
by the country’s central bank last year, had its first intraday
decline in four days, retreating 4 percent to 72 kobo. The
company reported a loss of 24.2 billion naira ($160 million) for
the eight months through December.  
 Sterling Bank Plc  (STERLNBA NL), a Nigerian lender, rose 9
kobo, or 4.7 percent, to 1.99 naira, the highest in almost two
weeks. The bank plans to raise 100 billion naira, Reuters
reported after the market closed on June 18, citing Chief
Strategy Officer Yemi Odubiyi.
