             The European Union will review a
bill being debated in the Italian parliament that restricts
wiretapping and imposes fines on media leaking information about
criminal probes, Justice Commissioner  Viviane Reding  told La
Repubblica in an interview.  
 Once the draft, which was passed by the  Senate  on June 10,
becomes law, the EU “will closely review the text, keeping in
mind that the” European Commission “always defends press and
information freedom,” Repubblica cited Redding as saying.
