             Natural gas futures fell in New York
as stock and commodity markets pared gains with a strengthening
dollar and as gas failed to break a technical resistance point.  
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities rose 0.3
percent to 263.58 at 2:31 p.m. after touching a five-week high
of 267.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was 0.1% higher at
1,118.26 after gaining as much as 1.2 percent. The dollar rose
against the euro after being weaker earlier in the day.  
 “Equities are off their highs and it’s pressuring
commodities,” said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group
Inc., a consulting company in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “Gas
failed to break the key $5.24 level for a fifth day.”  
 Natural gas for July delivery fell 12.4 cents, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $4.873 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising as high as
$5.182. Gas futures have risen 13 percent this month.  
 “The dollar is pushing crude and other commodities down,”
said  Tom Orr , director of research at Weeden & Co., a brokerage
in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Gas has had a big run and we are
seeing a pullback.”  
 The dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against
six trading partners, rose 0.2 percent to 85.887.  
 Crude oil for July delivery rose 64 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $77.82 a barrel in New York, after gaining as much as 2.3
percent earlier.  
 Early Gain  
 Natural gas rose in earlier trading as hotter-than-normal
weather boosted demand from power plants and as China’s pledge
to relax its currency’s fixed rate sent commodities higher.  
 Temperatures were forecast to be “much above” average
levels this week across the U.S. Midwest and East, according to
MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather.  
 New York will have a high of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32
Celsius) on June 23, 9 degrees above normal, according to
AccuWeather.com. Chicago will have a high of 86 degrees.  
 Cooling requirements in the U.S. will be 37 percent higher
than normal from tomorrow through June 28, according to Weather
Derivatives of Belton, Missouri.  
 The yuan rose the most since a July 2005 revaluation after
China’s central bank ended the two-year peg. A stronger currency
will boost the country’s purchasing power. China is the world’s
second-biggest consumer of crude oil after the U.S. and the
biggest consumer of commodities such as copper and aluminum.  
 “If China lets the yuan appreciate, they can buy more
commodities, and it’s very bullish news,” said  Michael Rose ,
director of trading at Angus Jackson Inc. Fort Lauderdale,
Florida.  
 Gas Rigs  
 The number of  rigs drilling for gas  in the U.S. fell to 953
from 954 last week, according to Baker Hughes Inc. The total was
up 38 percent from a year earlier. The number of rigs has been
above $940 since the end of March.  
 “This level of drilling has been more or less stable since
April and should lead to production growth, a factor the market
might be underestimating,” said  James R. Crandell , an analyst
at Barclays Capital in New York, said today in a note to
clients.  
 U.S. gas production will average 61.22 billion cubic feet a
day this year, up 2.1 percent from 59.98 billion last year,
according to the Energy Department’s monthly Short-Term Energy
Outlook released on June 8.  
 Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, fell 2.19 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $5.1507 per
million Btu, declining for the first day in seven, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
252,018 as of 2:51 p.m., compared with a three-month average
total of 259,000. Volume was 216,956 on June 19. Open interest
was 842,847 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
848,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.
