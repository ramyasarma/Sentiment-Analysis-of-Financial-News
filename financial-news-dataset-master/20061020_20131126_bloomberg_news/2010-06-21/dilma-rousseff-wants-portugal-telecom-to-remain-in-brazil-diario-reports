             Dilma Rousseff, Brazilian President
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s former cabinet chief and a 
candidate for the post of president, said it would be important
for Portugal Telecom SGPS SA to remain in Brazil, Diario 
Economico reported.  
 Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, Portugal’s biggest 
telecommunications company, is asking investors to vote June 30
on an increased 6.5 billion-euro bid from Telefonica SA of 
Spain for its stake in the venture that controls Brazilian 
wireless operator Vivo Participacoes SA.  
 Rousseff told Diario that she does not know if there will 
be a closer partnership between Brazilian oil company Petroleo 
Brasileiro SA and Galp Energia SGPS SA of Portugal through a 
shareholding, although that would be seen with “very good 
eyes” by the Brazilian government, the Portuguese newspaper 
said.
