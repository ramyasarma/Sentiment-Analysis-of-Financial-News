             Merrill Lynch & Co. hired  Bala Swaminathan  from  Standard Chartered Plc  as vice chairman for

 Swaminathan, Standard Chartered’s regional head of
origination and client coverage in South and Southeast Asia,
will move to India from Singapore, the people said. Swaminathan
declined to comment.

Mumbai in 2006 from  ICICI Bank  Ltd., India’s second-largest
lender.  
 Merrill Lynch ranks seventh in arranging equity and rights
sales in India this year and fifth in mergers and acquisition
