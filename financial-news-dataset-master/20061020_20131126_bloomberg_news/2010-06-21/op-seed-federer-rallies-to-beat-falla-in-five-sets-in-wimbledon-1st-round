             Defending champion Roger Federer
recovered from two sets down to beat Alejandro Falla in five
sets at the Wimbledon tennis championship today.  
 The Swiss, seeking to tie Pete Sampras’s Open era men’s
record of seven titles at the All England Club, hasn’t lost in
the first round of a Grand Slam since the French Open seven
years ago.  
 Federer, who claimed his previous four matches against
Colombia’s Falla in straight sets, won 5-7, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-1),
6-0 today.
