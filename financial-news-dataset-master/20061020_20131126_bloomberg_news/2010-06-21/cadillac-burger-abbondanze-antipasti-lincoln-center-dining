             With  American Ballet Theatre  and  New
York City Ballet  wrapping up their spring seasons, we’ve been
spending some time at  Lincoln Center , comparing our grand plies
to the professionals (while continuing to eat like an opera
singer). The Lincoln Center Festival and various out-of-doors
events are about to draw more crowds to the Upper West Side.
Here’s our list of area restaurants for a quick bite.  
 P.J. Clarke’s  
 Avoid the hollering that passes for conversation on the
main floor and head downstairs to  P.J. Clarke’s  wood-paneled,
red-check tablecloth “Club Room” for one fine burger. Served
on a tiny plate, the “Cadillac” comes with bacon, cheese and a
slice of red onion ($11.50); spuds are extra. Little-neck clams
from the raw bar are excellent, too.  
 P.J. Clarkes is at 44 W. 63rd Street near Broadway.

 Speedy Carts  
 Shun Lee West’s Cafe is a casual alternative to the formal
dragon palace’s top flight food. Carts stacked with fried and
steamed dim sum zip by, offering wrappings filled with chicken,
shrimp or vegetables. Carnivores will grab the appropriately
messy honey baby spareribs. Prices are in the $10 range per
plate.  
 Shun Lee Cafe is at 43 W. 65th St. Information: +1-212-595-
8895;  http://www.shunleewest.com   
 Fiorello  
 The hectic Lincoln Center mainstay has been turning out
good thin-crust pizza for years. Better is the abundant
antipasto bar (choose four for $21). Then split the lemon
chicken with pan-fried zucchini ($28). Finish with a glass of
chilled limoncello.  
 Cafe Fiorello is at 1900 Broadway, between 63rd and 64th
Streets. Information: +1-212-595-5330;

 Ed’s Chowder House  
 You can’t get much closer to Lincoln Center than Ed’s
Chowder House, directly across the street from the  David H. Koch
Theater . Go here for great cocktails, spicy mussels, the three-
chowder sampler (squash, Manhattan and New England clam),
oysters and people-watching.  
 Ed’s Chowder House is at 44 W. 63rd St.; Information: +1-

 Sapphire  
 For refined Indian food, Sapphire’s atmosphere is elegant,
with occasional spotty service. Expect all the classics from the
tandoor plus excellent chicken vindaloo. If you’re heading to a
matinee, go for the buffet lunch, which is a good deal at
$14.95.  
 Sapphire is at 1845 Broadway, between 60th and 61st
Streets. Information: +1-212-245-4444;  http://www.sapphireny.com   
 Vince & Eddie’s  
 Vince & Eddie’s feels like a pleasantly worn Connecticut
inn transplanted to Columbus Avenue. The other week, a simply
prepared, rosy rack of Colorado lamb ($38.95) arrived post-
haste, while friends feasted on sauteed cod ($25) and duckling
with mushrooms and wild rice ($22.00). A garden room enhances
the bucolic setting.  
 Vince & Eddie’s is at 70 W. 68th Street near Columbus
Avenue. Information: +1-212-721-0068.  
 La Traviata  
 Named for Verdi’s opera about a tubercular party girl, La
Traviata, is just right if you’re rushing to a show. A slice has
that perfect crust-to-sauce-to-oil ratio and costs $3.75.  
 La Traviata is at 101 W. 68th St., near Columbus Avenue.
information: +1-212-721-1101.  
 Cafe Luxembourg  
 After the show: Cafe Luxembourg, which opened in 1983,
still pulls a happy crowd with its lively bar and brasserie
classics like the country salad of frisee with bacon lardons and
a poached egg ($14) and onion soup ($10). A nicely aged, beefy
New York strip steak with French fries costs $32. Creme brulee,
profiteroles and a pucker-making lemon tart are $10 each, and
your espresso has been drawn by someone who actually knows how.  
 Cafe Luxembourg is at 200 W. 70th Street near Amsterdam
Avenue. Information: +1-212-873-7411;

 Bar Boulud  
 It’s best to be half-deaf, but there’s no question that Bar
Boulud has terrines and pates like no other place. Then there’s
the escargots persillade with tiny potato croquettes to help mop
up the garlic and oil ($16). Great wine list.  
 Bar Boulud is at 1900 Broadway, near 65th Street.
Information: +1-212-595-0303;  http://www.barboulud.com   
 Goodbye Forever  
 Addio per sempre. O’Neals, which never failed us with
reliable meals and excellent service, is closing this month
after 46 years on the street. No more broiled shrimp curry with
basmati rice and baby bok choy or smoked salmon tartar. The
consoling news is that restaurateur  Steve Hanson  of madly
popular Atlantic Grill will open his new place here.  
 Until the end of the month, O’Neals is at 49 W. 64th Street
near Broadway. Information: +1-212-787-4663;
