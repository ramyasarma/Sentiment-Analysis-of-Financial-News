             Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan’s
government will reverse its policy preventing retiring civil
servants joining companies they once regulated, the Mainichi
newspaper reported, citing unidentified government officials.  
 Yukio Hatoyama, the former prime minister, had sought to
ban the practice known as “amakudari,” or descent from heaven,
the newspaper said.
