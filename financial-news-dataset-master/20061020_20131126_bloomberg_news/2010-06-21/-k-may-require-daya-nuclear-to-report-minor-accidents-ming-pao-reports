             The Hong Kong government is
considering a plan that would require Daya Bay Nuclear Power
Operations and Management Co. to report minor accidents, Hong
Kong’s Ming Pao Daily News reported today. Under the proposal,
Daya Bay would need to report small accidents such as the
leakage on May 23 to shareholder CLP Holdings Ltd., the
government’s Environmental Protection Department and the
Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Chinese-
language paper said, without saying where it got the
information.
