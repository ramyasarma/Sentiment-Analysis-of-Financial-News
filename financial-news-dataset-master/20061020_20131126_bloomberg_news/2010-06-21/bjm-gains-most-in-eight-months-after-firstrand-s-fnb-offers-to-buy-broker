             Barnard Jacobs Mellet Holdings Ltd. 
climbed the most in eight months in Johannesburg trading after
 FirstRand Ltd . offered 4.50 rand ($0.60) a share to acquire the
brokerage company.  
 Barnard Jacobs, known as BJM, rose as much as 15 percent to
4.40 rand, the biggest intraday gain since Oct. 14. The stock
traded at 4.33 rand as of 11 a.m. in Johannesburg, valuing the
company at 433 million rand, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 BJM, which agreed to sell its securities unit to
Renaissance Capital last month, has been looking to sell the
rest of the company. FirstRand, South Africa’s second-biggest
financial services company, said it will gain 11,000 private
clients from the acquisition that will also give 45,000 existing
wealth management customers access to bond and equity trades.  
 “Our clients should immediately notice the added depth in
talent and delivery arising from the transaction,” FNB Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Jordaan  said today in a statement.
“FNB will incorporate the businesses and skills of BJM into its
wealth segment.”
