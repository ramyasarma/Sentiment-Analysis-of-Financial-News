             Gold will climb to a record $1,300
an ounce in the coming weeks as investors sell the dollar, and
may advance to $1,500 by the end of 2010, according to a
technical analysis by Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 Bullion may jump to $1,500 an ounce, 19 percent more than
the record $1,262.50 set on June 18, before investors see gold
as a “bubble,” said  Michael Macdonald , technical analyst with
Credit Suisse, citing momentum indicators.  
 The metal’s 14-day relative strength index, which compares
gains and losses on a weekly basis, advanced to a one-month high
of 68.195 on June 18. A level of more than 70 is seen by some
investors as a signal that prices are about to drop.  
 “The trend is quite dominant and well-defined, as the
momentum is strong and the RSI is trending higher,” Singapore-
based Macdonald said in an interview. “If it hits $1,500 by the
end of the year, it will create a bubble scenario and that could
be a bit panicky.”  
 Gold has gained 15 percent this year and is set for a 10th
annual advance, the longest run of gains since 1920, as
investors seek to safeguard their wealth against the sovereign-
debt crisis in Greece and other European countries.  
 The metal traded at $1,258.35 an ounce at 9:09 a.m. in
Singapore. The dollar slumped 2.3 percent last week against six
major currencies, the most since May 2009.  
 “Sometimes it’s a commodity and sometimes it’s foreign
exchange,” Macdonald said, referring to gold. “At the moment
it’s behaving as a currency. People are selling the dollar and
they are going to build gold as a safe haven.”  
 There may be “minor profit-taking” near $1,300 an ounce
but “chances are that any reaction towards the level will be
short-lived,” as fresh money flows in, he said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.
