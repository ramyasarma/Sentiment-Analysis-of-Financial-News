             ITT Corp. , the maker of filtration
systems and submersible pumps, agreed to buy closely held rental
company Godwin Pumps for $585 million to expand its wastewater
equipment revenue.  
 The acquisition will reduce 2010 profit by 3 cents to 5
cents a share and add to 2011 earnings, White Plains, New York-
based ITT said today in a statement. Godwin Pumps, which has
about 800 workers, generated $200 million in revenue in 2009,
ITT said.  
 ITT, which has spent about $3 billion in the past five
years on acquisitions, said in April it planned to expand its
fluid technologies unit.  
 “With what we see as both strong expected cash flow
generation and a healthy balance, ITT should easily digest the
purchase, while leaving room for additional strategic
acquisitions,” ratings company Standard & Poor’s said in a
note.  
 ITT had $880 million in cash and cash equivalents at the
end of March. Godwin, based in Bridgeport, New Jersey, operates
a U.S. rental fleet of more than 6,000 pumps and 26 equipment
rental facilities.  
 ITT advanced 52 cents to $49.05 at 11:40 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares had lost 2.4
percent this year before today.
