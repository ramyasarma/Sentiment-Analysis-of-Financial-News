             HudBay Minerals Inc.  rose the most
in more than four months in Toronto trading after the Canadian
base-metals miner said it hired Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd.’s  David Garofalo  as president and chief executive officer.  
 HudBay rose 93 cents, or 7.9 percent, to C$12.65 at 4:10
p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading, the biggest gain since
Feb. 11.  The shares  have fallen 6.8 percent this year.  
 Garofalo, chief financial officer of Agnico-Eagle for more
than a decade, will replace HudBay interim-CEO  Warren Holmes 
July 12, the company said in a statement today. HudBay has been
without a permanent CEO since  Peter Jones  retired last year.
Garofalo, 44, also will serve on the board.  
 “We are extremely pleased to have someone of David’s
caliber and reputation,” HudBay Chairman  G. Wesley Voorheis 
said in the statement. “He is recognized as an outstanding
executive in the mining industry.”  
 Shares of mining companies also rose after China’s central
bank ended a two-year currency peg for its yuan.  
 Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals producer,
 rose  C$1.28, or 3.6 percent, to C$36.67 in Toronto, while
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  advanced $2.18, or 3.3
percent, to $68.08 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  
 Agnico-Eagle  fell  C$2.18, or 3.3 percent, to C$63.96 in
Toronto.
