             Yuan forwards climbed toward a one-
month high after China’s central bank signaled an end to the
currency’s two-year peg to the dollar.  
 The 12-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.05
percent to 6.7092 per dollar at 8:24 a.m. in Hong Kong, paring
an advance of 0.35 percent. That implies that traders are
betting on a 1.7 percent appreciation over the coming year. The
three-month contract climbed 0.4 percent.  
 “This time it will be a very gradual appreciation but it
could be front-loaded too,” said  Nizam Idris , a Singapore-based
currency strategist at UBS AG, the world’s second-largest
foreign-exchange trader. Traders are waiting for signals when
the central bank fixes the reference rate at 9:15 a.m. Beijing
time and when the market opens at 9:30 a.m., he said.

                     June 21 (Bloomberg) -- Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about China's shift in currency policy, and its implications for the nation's economy and trade. 
     The People’s Bank of China two days ago indicated it’s abandoning the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global crisis to shield exporters. The central bank said while there’s no basis for  “large scale” moves in the currency, the exchange rate will be allowed increased “flexibility.” (Source: Bloomberg)
