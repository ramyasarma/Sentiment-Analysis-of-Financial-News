             Asian stocks  climbed, driving the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index to its longest winning streak in 11
months, on speculation China’s relaxing of its currency peg to
the dollar will bolster growth in the world’s No. 3 economy.  
 BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company,
increased 2 percent as investors bet commodities demand will
rise.  Hang Lung Properties Ltd.  climbed 6 percent in Hong Kong
on speculation the yuan’s appreciation will make the city’s real
estate cheaper for mainland buyers.  Air China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest airline, climbed 6.4 percent in Shanghai on optimism a
stronger Chinese currency will reduce dollar-denominated costs.  
 “This is a good move for China,” said  Shane Oliver , head
of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney. “It
signals greater confidence in the outlook, less risk of trade
tensions with the U.S. or Europe, an additional means to help
control inflation and it should help rebalance the economy.”  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  gained 2.5 percent to 119.06 as
of 7:48 p.m. in Tokyo, the most since June 3. The measure has
risen 8.4 percent in the past eight days, the longest series of
gains since July 2009. The gauge is down 7.5 percent from its
high this year on April 15 amid concern Chinese measures to curb
property prices and Europe’s debt crisis will hurt global growth.  
 China’s  Shanghai Composite Index  gained 2.9 percent and
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbed 2.8 percent after the
Chinese central bank pledged on June 19 to make the yuan more
flexible. The People’s Bank of China ruled out a one-time
revaluation of the currency that’s been held at about 6.83 yuan
per dollar since mid-2008. The currency rose 0.42 percent to
6.7976 per dollar, the most since July 2005, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Policy Shift  
 The  Nikkei 225 Index  increased 2.4 percent, while South
Korea’s  Kospi Index  gained 1.6 percent. The  S&P/ASX 200 Index 
rose 1.3 percent in Australia, where  Telstra Corp.  advanced 3.4
percent after signing a broadband deal with the government.  
 Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.5
percent. The gauge rose 0.1 percent on June 18 amid speculation
Europe’s efforts to contain its debt crisis are succeeding.  
 The global economy is “gradually recovering and the upturn
in the Chinese economy has become more solid,” the People’s
Bank of China said in a statement announcing its yuan action.  
 An appreciation of the yuan, also known as the renminbi,
will benefit exporters and Chinese employment more than it hurts
them, the central bank said in a statement. A more flexible
currency would also help to curb consumer-price gains, asset
bubbles and dependence on exports for growth, it said.  
 Biggest Gains  
 The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 3.3 percent last week,
its biggest weekly advance since December, as reports showed
sentiment among American consumers improved and New York
manufacturing grew. Shares in the gauge trade at 15 times
 estimated earnings , up from about 20 times at the start of 2010.  
 Gauges of raw-material suppliers, energy and industrial
companies posted the biggest gains among the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index’s 10 industry groups today.  
 BHP Billiton climbed 2 percent to A$39.91.  Rio Tinto Ltd. ,
the world’s third-biggest mining company, advanced 2.1 percent
to A$72.34.  Mitsubishi Corp. , which generated about 40 percent
of its revenue from commodities in the year ended March 31,
jumped 6.6 percent to 2,033 yen. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s
largest producer of the metal, surged 7.2 percent to HK$15.84 in
Hong Kong.  
 “We also think it’s actually good for the value of the
commodity equities,”  Saxon Nicholls , a Melbourne-based fund
manager at Herschel Asset Management Ltd., said in an interview
yesterday. China’s policy move is “good for commodity prices.”  
 Machinery Makers  
 Samsung Electronics Co. , which got 26 percent of sales from
China last year, gained 1 percent to 830,000 won. Parkson
Holdings Bhd., a Malaysian retailer that last year derived 72
percent of its sales in China, rose 2 percent to 5.60 ringgit.  
 Komatsu Ltd. , the world’s second-biggest maker of
excavators, advanced 4.6 percent to 1,782 yen. Hitachi
Construction Machinery, which receives 31 percent of its revenue
from China, rose 6.7 percent to 1,873 yen, the Nikkei 225’s
biggest increase.  
 “The yuan’s appreciation is not bad for China amid
inflation fears because it eases import prices,” said  Hisakazu Amano , who helps oversee about $18 billion at T&D Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “Stocks are probably rising today on
expectations domestic demand in China will increase with falling
import prices.”  
 In Hong Kong, Hang Lung Properties, which received about 40
percent of sales from China in the last fiscal year, gained 6
percent to HK$31.15.  China Resources Land Ltd. , a state-
controlled developer, jumped 4.4 percent to HK$16.30. Sino Land
Co., a Hong Kong developer, climbed 5.6 percent to HK$14.64.  
 Chinese Airlines  
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said June 15 that local
stock and property prices may be driven higher once China allows
the yuan to resume gains as the city become more affordable to
mainland investors. The HKMA said today it sees no need to
change the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the U.S. dollar.  
 Air China climbed 6.4 percent to 11.73 yuan, while  China
Eastern Airlines Corp.  gained 6.9 percent to HK$3.74 in Hong
Kong.  China Southern Airlines Co.  surged 6.5 percent to HK$3.75.  
 Yuan gains will help lower the carriers’ debt burdens,  Luo Zhuping , China Eastern Airlines Corp.’s board secretary, said in
an interview yesterday. Foreign-currency debt accounts for about
60 percent of the company’s total debt, Luo said.  
 Telstra, Australia’s biggest phone company, increased 3.4
percent to A$3.34 after reaching an A$11 billion ($9.5 billion)
accord with the government to shut down its copper wire network.  
 The deal gives NBN Co., the government-backed company
building Australia’s first national fiber network, access to
Telstra’s fixed-line customers, as well as the ducts and
trenches that house its copper wires.
