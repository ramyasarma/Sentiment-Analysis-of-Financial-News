             Germans are more confident about
prospects for the economy than a year ago,  Bild Zeitung

 About 25 percent of the people surveyed said they’re
confident about the economic outlook for the next 12 months, up
from 16 percent a year ago, the newspaper said. Half of the
respondents said they think their jobs are safe, according to
the report.
