             Profit margins for U.S. companies are
likely to tumble from last quarter’s record, a decline that will
lead to much lower earnings than analysts expect, according to
economist  Andrew Smithers .  
 “The corporate sector’s outlook is extremely bad,”
Smithers, founder and chairman of the investment-advisory firm of
Smithers & Co., said last week in an interview. “I can’t see any
way out of it.”  
 As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, profit before interest, taxes
and depreciation -- accounting adjustments for wear and tear on
buildings and equipment -- amounted to 36.4 percent of U.S.
corporate output in the first quarter. The calculation was based
on  data  compiled by the Commerce Department.  
 The percentage was the highest since the department’s
quarterly  data  started in 1947, as the chart depicts. Smithers,
whose firm counsels more than 100 clients on international asset
allocation, included a similar illustration in a June 18 report.  
 Margins “are likely to fall a lot” as governments restrain
deficit spending next year, reducing cash flow elsewhere in the
economy, the report said. Companies will bear the brunt of the
shift as opposed to households, which are heavily in debt and
save relatively little, in his view.  
 The decline in margins will lead to profits falling “well
short of expectations,” he wrote. Analysts foresee earnings at
companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rising 34 percent
this year and 18 percent next year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.
