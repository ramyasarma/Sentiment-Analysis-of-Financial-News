             Liquefied natural gas traders are
taking advantage of the lowest shipping rates in five years and
rising prices in the U.K. to store fuel on tankers and profit
from higher values in coming months.  
 The costs to buy an LNG cargo in Trinidad & Tobago, store
it on a ship for one month and transport it to Britain amount to
$4.60 per million British thermal units, according to  Navin Thakur , an analyst at London-based Drewry Shipping Consultant
Ltd. Based on July delivery prices of $6.41 on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange, profits from the trade amount to 39
percent, excluding import terminal and regasification expenses.  
 Charter rates have fallen as newer vessels entered the
global fleet and demand declined from South Korea and Japan, the
world’s largest LNG importers. July U.K. gas prices are up 24
percent this month as European buyers  stockpile  for winter and
North Sea output wanes.  
 “The spot charter rates are low, so storage on ships will
happen and is happening,” said  Keith Bainbridge , a partner at
shipbrokers RS Platou LLP in London.  
 Shipping costs have declined to $30,000 a day, the lowest
price since 2005, from more than $45,000 last winter, according
to quarterly estimates, Thakur said. Lower storage costs mean
traders can lock in gains by selling into the forward U.K.
market and holding cargoes until delivery.  
 “Available LNG liquefaction capacity exceeds current LNG
demand by an uncomfortably large margin,” said  Morten Frisch , a
U.K.-based independent LNG consultant.  
 Keeping Cool  
 Drewry’s calculations include boil-off costs, where a
portion of the ship’s cargo is lost in order to keep the rest in
a refrigerated, liquefied state. The largest part is the cost of
the gas itself, which is about $4 per million Btu for BP Plc-
marketed LNG from Trinidad & Tobago as of today, according to
calculations based on data from the Energy Intelligence Group.  
 “There are plenty of vessels available and rates are weak,
and lots of new builds are coming out of yards,” said  Tony Regan , a consultant with Trizen Ltd. in Singapore, formerly an
LNG trader with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  
 Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG producer, is idling at least
eight tankers in the Gulf of Oman, according to AISLive data on
Bloomberg as of June 3.  
 The cost of buying and storing a cargo at a daily charter
rate of $30,000 for delivery this winter may average $6 per
million Btu, according to Thakur. Japan paid almost twice that
for spot LNG supplies, including shipping fees, in January.  
 Gas Prices  
 U.K. winter gas, for the six months from October, at
National Balancing Point, Britain’s gas hub, has risen 11
percent this year and traded at $8.06 per million Btu yesterday.
U.S. gas for the same period has fallen about 13 percent to
$5.30 per million Btu this year.  
 In other markets, oil for December delivery settled at
$81.42 a barrel yesterday, which is 3.2 percent down for the
year so far, and a premium of $3.60 on next-month prices.  
 Utilities in Europe can buy pipeline gas from Russia,
Algeria and Norway, while in Asia most countries rely on LNG,
which is gas chilled to liquid form for transportation by ship.  
 Asian buyers typically monitor U.K. and U.S. gas price
benchmarks, whichever is higher, and adjust their bids
accordingly to attract cargoes away from the Atlantic Ocean
market. Spot prices in the Far East jumped to as much as $14 per
million Btu last winter, from about $7 in the middle of 2009,
then retreated to about $6.50 in March, according to Japanese
customs data.  
 Limited storage capacity in Japan and South Korea mean
those nations often pay more for individual cargoes when winter
temperatures fall below average or electricity use unexpectedly
rises. Spot demand during winter may account for more than half
of annual imports.  
 Producers such as Qatar Liquefied Gas Co., BP and Shell can
typically profit more from diverting LNG cargoes than trading
companies such as Morgan Stanley or Vitol Group, as they control
more vessels and have access to greater supplies, said  Debbie Turner , director of LNG at BS Energy Services Ltd.
