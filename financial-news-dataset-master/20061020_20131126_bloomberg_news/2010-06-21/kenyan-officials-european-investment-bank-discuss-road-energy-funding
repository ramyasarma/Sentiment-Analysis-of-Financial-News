             The European Investment Bank is in
talks with Kenya over financing road and energy projects, to
help the government meet its goal of creating a middle-income
country by 2030, said bank Vice President Plutarchos Sakellaris.  
 Sakellaris, on a three-day visit to Kenya, is due to meet
President  Mwai Kibaki , Prime Minister  Raila Odinga , Acting
Transport Minister  Amos Kimunya  and Energy Minister  Kiraitu Murungi  to discuss funding plans for the country, he said today
in an interview in Nairobi, the capital.  
 Plans that may be eligible for bank funds include
construction of the Lake Turkana wind-power project in northern
Kenya, a toll road in Nairobi and an electricity transmission
line that would run 70 kilometers (44 miles) from Suswa south to
Nairobi, Sakellaris said. “We would be willing to look at
these,” he said.  
 The bank lent 225 million euros ($279 million) to Kenya
from 2005 to 2009, more than to any other country in East and
Central Africa, he said.  
 The bank’s board is expected to decide by September whether
to lend Tanzania, Kenya’s neighbor, 120 million euros to build a
400-kilovolt power line that would reinforce the connection
between the towns of Iringa in the south and Shinyanga in the
north, he said.
