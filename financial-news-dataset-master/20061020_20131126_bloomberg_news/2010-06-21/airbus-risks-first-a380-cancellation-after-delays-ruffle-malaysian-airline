             Airbus SAS risks suffering the first
cancellation for its superjumbo A380 after  Malaysian Airline
System Bhd.  said continued production delays on the world’s
largest passenger plane have frustrated the airline.  
 Malaysian has ordered six A380s, and initial deliveries are
more than four years late, Chief Executive Officer  Tengku Azmil Zahruddin  told reporters today in Kelana Jaya, outside Kuala
Lumpur. The airline “cannot tolerate” any additional holdup
for its A380s, which have a list price of about $327 million
each. Malaysian was granted discounts for being an early client.  
 “We will not rule anything out at this stage,” Zahruddin
said. “We are not happy.”  
 Airbus has struggled to get up to speed on production and
delivery of the A380 after design faults and complexities such
as showers, enclosed suites and custom lighting slowed
manufacturing. Airbus began deliveries of the A380 in 2007 after
spending at least 18 billion euros ($22 billion) developing the
plane, 50 percent more than originally projected.  
 A cancellation by Malaysian would be Airbus’s first for the
passenger model of the A380. Airbus had to shelve the cargo
version in 2009 after both FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service
Inc. canceled orders for 20 A380 freighters in total.  
 ‘Very Sorry’  
 “We are sorry about the delays, which have been a knock-on
effect from the year 2009, but we are confident that we can meet
the revised delivery schedule,” said  Stefan Schaffrath , an
Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France.  
 Airbus is now at a stage where it has the production pace
under control, and the company is now working to reduce costs,
 Louis Gallois , chief executive of Airbus parent company European
Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co., told journalists this month 
at briefings at the Berlin Air Show.  
 The company is targeting 20 deliveries of A380 this year
after turning over just 10 A380s in 2009, and 12 in 2008. Airbus
says it remains years from the program reaching breakeven.  
 The program got a boost on June 8, when Emirates Airline
said it will buy 32 additional A380s, bringing its total order
to 90. Airbus has delivered a total of 30 A380s to date, to
carriers including Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Qantas Airways Ltd.  
 The first of Malaysian’s A380s was originally due in 2007,
before being delayed to January 2011 and then to the third
quarter of 2011. Delivery was pushed back to 2012 this year.  
 Malaysian aims to conclude talks with Airbus by the end of
this year, Tengku Azmil said. The carrier’s first A380 is due in
the second quarter of 2012, following at least three delays.
Malaysian had been awarded 330 million ringgit ($104 million) in
compensation from Airbus for earlier delays, it said last year.  
 “We cannot tolerate another postponement,” said Malaysian
Air Chairman  Munir Abdul Majid . “We are pretty firm with
Airbus.”
