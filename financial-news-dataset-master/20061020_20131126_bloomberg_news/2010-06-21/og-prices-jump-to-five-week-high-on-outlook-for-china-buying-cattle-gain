             Hog futures rose to a five-week high
on speculation that U.S. pork exports will increase after China,
the world’s largest consumer, ended its currency peg to the
dollar. Cattle also gained.  
 China’s yuan jumped the most since 2005. The peg was
adopted two years ago during the global financial crisis to
protect exporters. China was the fourth-largest buyer of U.S.
 pork  last year. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials climbed to a five-week high today on bets that the
global economy will expand.  
 “This will give the Chinese more purchasing power with
their currency,” said  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive
at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. Meat prices “are
going to benefit greatly from the reversal in economics,” he
said.  
 Hog futures for August settlement climbed 1.7 cents, or 2.1
percent, to 84.35 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 84.65 cents, the highest
level for a most-active contract since May 14. The commodity has
jumped 29 percent this year.  
 U.S.  wholesale -pork prices rose 3 percent in the past two
sessions, boosting hog futures, Smith said. Pork climbed to
83.74 cents a pound on June 18 after touching a nine-week low on
June 16, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  
 Cattle Market  
 Cattle futures for August delivery rose 1.125 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 89.325 cents a pound. Earlier, the price reached
89.725 cents, the highest level since June 4. The commodity has
gained 3.7 percent this year.  
 Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement increased 1.525
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $1.117 a pound.  
 Wholesale  choice beef  climbed 0.4 percent at midday to
$1.5453 a pound, the highest level since June 10, according to
the USDA.  
 Cattle futures fell in the previous two sessions before a
report showed U.S. feedlots bought 23 percent more cattle in May
than a year earlier. Declines may have been exaggerated because
the USDA data was in line with analysts’ estimates, Smith said.  
 “There was nothing negative in the report,” Smith said.
“The market was fearing the worst, and I think it discounted
cattle too cheap.”
