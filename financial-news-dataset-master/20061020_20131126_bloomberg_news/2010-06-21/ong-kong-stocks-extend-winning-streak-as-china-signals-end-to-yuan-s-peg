             Hong Kong stocks  rose for a ninth
day, the longest winning streak in four years, after China
allowed the yuan to appreciate against the U.S. dollar, making
the city’s assets more affordable to mainland investors.  
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd., a Hong Kong developer, rallied 6
percent.  China Resources Land Ltd. , a state-controlled property
company, surged 4.4 percent. The Hang Seng Property Index’s 4.1
percent advance was the sharpest among the four industry groups
tracked by the Hang Seng Index.  Air China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest airline by market value, gained 6 percent.  
 The  Hang Seng Index  jumped 3.1 percent to 20,912.18, the
highest close since April 30. The gauge has increased 7.9
percent in the past nine days, the longest run of gains since
the 10 trading days to Feb. 27, 2006. The streak four years ago
came amid optimism that a cycle of interest-rate increases in
Hong Kong was coming to an end.  
 “This announced policy is a paradigm change, of which
impacts are long term, thus financial markets will be re-rating
Chinese stocks for long term attractiveness,” said  Lei Wang ,
who helps oversee $20.2 billion at the New Mexico-based
Thornburg International Value Fund. “I have been expecting this
RMB paradigm change, and our Chinese stock exposures have
already taken that as one of our long-term assumptions. In the
short term, airlines and financial stocks on the Hong Kong
market will benefit most.”  
 The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  of Chinese companies’
so-called H-shares surged 4.4 percent to 12,134.42, the largest
gain since June 10 last year.  
 Yuan Flexibility  
 China’s yuan climbed the most in 18 months against the
dollar after the People’s Bank of China said it would allow the
currency greater flexibility to move, boosting prospects for
nations who sell products to the world’s third-largest economy.  
 The central bank indicated it’s abandoning the 6.83 yuan
peg to the dollar adopted to shield exporters during the global
financial crisis. American lawmakers had argued that the yuan
peg was an unfair subsidy for China’s exporters. A stronger yuan
may allow policymakers the ability to stanch inflation without
restraining the economy.  
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it sees no need to
change the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the U.S. dollar. The HKMA
said June 15 that local stock and property prices may be driven
higher once China allows the yuan to resume gains as the city
becomes more affordable to mainland investors.  
 China Resources Land  advanced 4.4 percent to HK$16.30.
China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., a developer controlled by
the nation’s construction ministry, rallied 5.2 percent to
HK$16.60.  
 Property Gauge Leads  
 Hang Lung surged 6 percent to HK$31.15. Henderson Land
Development Co., controlled by billionaire  Lee Shau-kee , rose
3.4 percent to HK$47.75.  
 China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd., the country’s second-biggest
wireless carrier, surged 9.1 percent to HK$10.48, the largest
gain on the Hang Seng Index. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.,
China’s No. 2 insurer, advanced 6.5 percent to HK$66.75. The
stock was rated “overweight” by JPMorgan.  
 Air China  rallied 6 percent to HK$8.49. China Southern
Airlines Co., the nation’s biggest carrier, jumped 6.5 percent
to HK$3.75.  
 China’s airlines are major beneficiaries of a gain in the
yuan given their foreign-currency debt, said  Jing Ulrich , Hong
Kong-based chairwoman of China equities and commodities at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  
 Hang Seng Bank  
 The  Hang Seng Index  has dropped 4.4 percent this year as
worries about budget deficits in Europe and credit tightening by
China dented confidence in the strength of the global economy.
Shares on the benchmark index are priced at an average  13.8
times  estimated earnings, down from 18 times on Nov. 16, the
highest level in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 Hang Seng Bank Ltd., controlled by HSBC Holdings Plc,
climbed 1.1 percent to HK$105.40. The bank plans to raise the
pretax-profit contribution from corporate and commercial banking
to 30 percent in two years from 22.9 percent in 2009, Ming Pao
Daily News reported.  
 The bank is trying to attract enterprises in China and is
bolstering relationships with state-owned companies, the paper
quoted Deputy General Manager  Nixon Chan  as saying.  
 Costin New Materials Group Ltd. fell 0.8 percent to HK$2.36
on its debut, after climbing as much as 5 percent. The fabric
producer sold 240 million shares at HK$2.38 each, raising net
proceeds of HK$441.5 million ($56.8 million) according to a
statement.  
 June futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 2.9 percent to
20,962. All but two stocks advanced among the measure’s 43
constituents.
