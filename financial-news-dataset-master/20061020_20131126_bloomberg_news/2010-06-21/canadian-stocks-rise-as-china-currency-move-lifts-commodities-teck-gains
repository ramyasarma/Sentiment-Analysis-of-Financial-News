             Canadian stocks  rose, pushing the
Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index to a one-month high, as
commodity producers gained after China signaled it will relax
the yuan’s fixed rate to the U.S. dollar.  
 Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil company, Teck
Resources Ltd., the country’s largest base-metals producer, and
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., a producer of oil and natural
gas, led the advance as fuel and metals prices climbed. Biovail
Corp. jumped 9.8 percent after agreeing to merge with Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International of the U.S.  
 The  S&P/TSX  rose 122.29 points, or 1 percent, to 12,049.88
as of 11:01 a.m. in Toronto. Stocks rallied globally after the
People’s Bank of China said it will end a two-year currency peg
adopted during the global financial crisis to protect exporters,
a sign policy makers expect the world economy to strengthen.
China, the world’s largest copper consumer and second-biggest
user of oil after the U.S., signaled the change before the G-20
summit in Toronto on June 26 to 27.  
 “A weaker U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency means
stimulus for” commodities such as oil and metals that are
priced in the American currency, said  Danielle Park , who helps
manage C$200 million ($191 million) as a money manager at
Venable Park Investment Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario. “It’s
not a macro-economic bullish story. Commodities have more
downside because world demand is weak.”  
 Suncor Energy  rose 1.9 percent to C$35.10. Teck Resources
gained 4.9 percent to C$37.12. Canadian Natural Resources
climbed 1.8 percent to C$38.66.  
 Futures Advance  
 Crude oil for July delivery increased 1.6 percent to $78.39
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a six-week high,
and natural gas rose 3 percent. Copper led gains in industrial
metals, climbing 3.4 percent. Energy and materials producers
account for 46 percent of Canadian stocks.  
 Biovail, Canada’s largest publicly traded drugmaker, rose
the most in the S&P/TSX to C$16.33. Its merger with Valeant will
create a company with annual sales of $1.75 billion. The
transaction will add to per-share earnings for shareholders of
both companies within 12 months after the deal closes, Biovail
and Valeant said.  
 HudBay Minerals Inc.  rose 8.8 percent to C$12.75. The
copper and zinc producer named  David Garofalo  as president and
chief executive officer. He also will be a director. Garofalo is
a former senior vice president and chief financial officer at
Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd.  
 Thompson Creek Metals Co. gained 5.7 percent to C$10.82.
The molybdenum producer with operations in Idaho, Pennsylvania
and British Columbia was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at
UBS AG.
