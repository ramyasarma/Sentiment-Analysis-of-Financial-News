             China’s stocks  are likely to trigger
a rout for global equities if the Shanghai Composite Index fails
to hold a “double bottom,” according to inter-dealer broker BGC
Partners Inc.  
 Chinese stocks have been the “best forecast tool” for world
share markets, said  Jamie Coutts , a technical analyst and sales
manager at BGC. The  Shanghai Composite  may fall to as low as
2,200 should it breach the 2,481 to 2,491 level, he said.
The Shanghai index added 0.5 percent to 2,526.94 at 9:55 a.m.  
 China’s stocks recovered from the world financial crisis
ahead of other  major markets , while the Shanghai Composite
slumped in April just before the U.S. and other global indexes
started to give up their gains, Coutts said.  
 “If that level is broken I can only assume the U.S. and
other global markets will follow and break their respective
May/June lows which will have devastating downside
possibilities,” Coutts said in a phone interview from Singapore.  
 In the U.S., the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  is poised to
test 1,009, or 38.2 percent of its Fibonacci retracement, if it
breaks below a double bottom at 1,041 to 1,042, Coutts said.
Declines may take the benchmark U.S. index to as low as 945, he
said. That would represent a 15 percent retreat from the June 18
close of 1,117.51. The S&P 500 Index has advanced 0.2 percent
this year.  
 “The 1,041 is a critical support level which has been
tested recently in the form of a double bottom and 3 times in
total this year,” he said. “Psychologically, it’s a watershed
level and if it were broken, then this would complete a topping
pattern and an official downtrend is in place.”  
 China Bears  
 The Shanghai gauge has lost 23 percent this year, the
third-worst performer among 93 global indexes tracked by
Bloomberg, on concern government measures to rein in housing
prices and the European debt crisis will damp economic growth.  
 “This correction still needs to be played out,” Coutts
said.  
 The nation’s pledge over the weekend to make the yuan more
flexible may boost shares denominated in the currency when
markets open today, China International Capital Corp. and
Societe Generale SA said.  
 “The biggest risk to my view of downside is an
appreciation of the yuan,” Coutts said.  
 Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. The
ratios are based on the sequence pioneered by 13th century
mathematician Leonardo Pisano Fibonacci and used in technical
analysis to determine highs and lows for prices and predict
direction. Major Fibonacci points are 23.6 percent, 38.2 and
76.4 percent.
