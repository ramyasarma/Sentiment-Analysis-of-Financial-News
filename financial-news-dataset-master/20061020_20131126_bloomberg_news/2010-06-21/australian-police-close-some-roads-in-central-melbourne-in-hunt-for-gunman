             Police in Australia’s Victoria state
are hunting for a man suspected of involvement in an armed
robbery and car chase in the city of Melbourne.  
 Roads were closed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and
Olympic Park and people were warned to stay inside after the 19-
year-old was spotted with a firearm in the area, according to a
statement on the police department’s  website . A gun and a
balaclava were later found nearby.  
 No shots were fired at police or members of the public,
according to the statement. The man is considered dangerous and
should not be approached, police said.  
 Melbourne, the state’s capital, is Australia’s second-most
populous city. The Melbourne Cricket Ground hosts international
cricket matches and national Australian rules football games. A
gunman shot dead one man and wounded two other people in central
Melbourne in June 2007.
