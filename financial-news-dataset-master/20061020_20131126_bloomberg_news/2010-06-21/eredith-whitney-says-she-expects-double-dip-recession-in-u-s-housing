             The U.S.  housing market  will
experience a second recession, forcing banks to post additional
loan-loss reserves, analyst  Meredith Whitney  said.  
 “Most investors are not baking in a double-dip in
housing,” Whitney, founder of New York-based Meredith Whitney
Advisory Group, said today in an interview on CNBC. “You’re
going to see banks post additional reserves associated with this
double-dip in housing, and that means weak performance going
forward.”  
 U.S.  home prices  fell more than 30 percent from their peak
in 2006 through the first quarter of 2009, prompting banks to
take writedowns on mortgage loans.  Housing starts  have increased
24 percent since the low in April 2009 as mortgage rates
remained near record lows and the U.S. government offered tax
credits to homebuyers.  
 Whitney said she didn’t foresee the trend of some
homeowners paying off credit cards and other debt instead of
making mortgage payments, as they await better terms on mortgage
modification programs.  
 Job cuts by state and local governments will also
contribute to a “rough second half” for the U.S. economy, she
said.  
 Financial reform will slow the velocity of money and cause
“de-banking” as more Americans lose access to some banking
services, making it “more expensive to be poor in this
country,” Whitney said.
