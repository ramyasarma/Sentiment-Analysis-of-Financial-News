             UBS AG, Switzerland’s  largest  lender,
 appointed  Ashley Jarvis as global head of business and capital
consultancy in its prime brokerage division, according to an
internal memo seen by Bloomberg today.  
 Jarvis, who now runs prime brokerage sales in Asia-Pacific,
will report to  Stuart Hendel , UBS’s global head of prime
brokerage, and  David Gray , Asia-Pacific head of prime services,
it said.  Chris Cockerill , a Hong Kong-based spokesman for UBS,
confirmed the content of the memo from Hendel and Gray.  
 London-based Jarvis will relocate to Hong Kong next year,
the memo said.  
 UBS also named  Tamera Hodges  as head of prime brokerage
sales for Asia-Pacific, reporting to Gray, said the memo. She
will relocate to Hong Kong from London, where she was a member
of the prime broking sales team for Europe.  
 In her new role, Hodges’ duties will include capital
introductions and business consultancy, it said. She was based
in Hong Kong and helped set up UBS’s prime brokerage unit in the
region before moving to London, it added.  
 Prime brokers provide services such as stock-, cash-lending
and trade clearing. The consulting business and capital
introduction teams help hedge funds set up offices and introduce
them to potential investors.
