             The yen may rise for a third day
against the euro on speculation that European banks will
struggle to raise money amid the debt crisis, supporting demand
for Japan’s currency as a refuge.  
 The yen strengthened versus 12 of its 16 major
counterparts as European Central Bank governing council member
Christian Noyer said some banks in the 16-nation region are
facing funding problems. The pound may fall for a second day
against the greenback on concern that U.K’s Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne will outline the deepest spending cuts
since the 1970s, hindering the nation’s economic recovery.  
 “There seems to be worries over European banks’ funding
pressures,” said  Yuji Saito , director of the foreign-exchange
department in Tokyo at Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment
Bank. “This may lead to some buying of the yen.”  
 Japan’s currency traded at 112.14 per euro at 8:17 a.m. in
Tokyo from 112.18 in New York yesterday, when it touched 113.42,
the lowest level since June 3. The yen was at 91.01 per dollar
from 91.11. The euro bought $1.2321 from $1.2312 yesterday,
when it reached $1.2487, the strongest since May 24. The pound
fetched $1.4763 from $1.4757.  
 ECB’s Noyer said yesterday, “some banks have started
facing increasing funding problems. The situation reflects a
general state of uncertainty which, left unchecked, could have
significant consequences on financial stability and the real
economy, as was the case during the last part of 2008.”  
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel will deliver a speech on
financial-market reform in Berlin later today. European leaders
including Merkel have called for aggressive deficit-cutting
from the Group of 20 nations, in contrast to U.S. President
Barack Obama’s emphasis on growth ahead of the G-20 summit
meeting in Toronto on June 26-27.
