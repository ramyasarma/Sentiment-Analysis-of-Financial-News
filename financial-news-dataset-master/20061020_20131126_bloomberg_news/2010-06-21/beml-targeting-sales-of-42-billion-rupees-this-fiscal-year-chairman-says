             BEML Ltd.  is targeting a record 42
billion rupees ($918 million) in sales this fiscal year as the
Indian state-run construction equipment maker wins more orders
to build coaches for rail networks, the company’s chairman said.  
 “The big rail and metro networks are driving growth,”
Chairman  V.R.S. Natarajan  told reporters today. “We are also
aiming for sales of 50 billion rupees in the year ending March
2012.” The Bangalore-based company posted revenue of 29.7
billion rupees in the 12 months ended March 31, according to a
statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange last month.  
 Delhi Metro Rail Corp.  is expanding its commuter rail
network in the capital, while the nation’s financial center
Mumbai and technology hub Bangalore are building new mass-
transit projects. The equipment maker, formerly called Bharat
Earth Movers Ltd., makes bulldozers, dump trucks and hydraulic
excavators for the mining, construction, power, irrigation and
steel industries. It also makes high-power diesel engines.  
 BEML shares rose 1.4 percent to 1036.35 rupees at close of
trading in Mumbai.  
 The company won orders worth 16.7 billion rupees from
 Bangalore Metro Rail Corp.  and plans to invest 6.8 billion
rupees in the next two to three years for expansion, Natarajan
said.  
 BEML is setting up a plant to make aircraft parts in the
southern state of Karnataka, Natarajan said. The company has
orders worth a combined 200 billion rupees for the next 10 years,
he said.
