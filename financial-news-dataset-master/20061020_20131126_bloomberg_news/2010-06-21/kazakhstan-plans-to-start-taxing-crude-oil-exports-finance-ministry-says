             Kazakhstan plans to resume an export
tax on crude oil and begin the levy for certain metals to
increase government revenue.  
 Shipments of copper, zinc and gold will be taxed if the
proposal goes forward, Finance Ministry spokeswoman Anna
Zhekenova said by telephone today. She didn’t specify when the
levies may start, at what rates or which metals may be exempt.  
 Kazakhstan, holder of 3 percent of the world’s proved oil
reserves at the end of 2009, according to BP Plc, began taxing
crude exports in May 2008 to raise cash amid a tightening of
global credit markets.  
 The duty was cut to zero in January 2009 for the producers
that were targeted, which numbered about 40 and included the BG
Group Plc and Eni SpA-led Karachaganak venture, KazMunaiGas
Exploration & Production, TOO Zhaikmunai and AO PetroKazakhstan.  
 Kazakh Prime Minister  Karim Masimov  told lawmakers in
Astana that a new budget plan for 2010 and 2011 will include
revenue from export duties on certain mineral resources if the
lawmakers will support the taxes, Novosti-Kazakhstan  reported 
today. The budget plans are set to be presented in September,
Masimov said, according to the news service.  
 Kazakhmys Plc  and AO Kazzinc, a unit of Glencore
International AG, are Kazakhstan’s largest copper and zinc
producers, respectively.
