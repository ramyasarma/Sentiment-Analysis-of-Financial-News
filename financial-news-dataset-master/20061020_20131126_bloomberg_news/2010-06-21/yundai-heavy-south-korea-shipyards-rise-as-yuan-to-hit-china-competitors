             Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , the
world’s largest shipbuilder, led advances among shipyards in
Seoul trading on expectations that a stronger yuan will help
improve their price competitiveness against rivals in China.  
 Hyundai Heavy  climbed 4.9 percent to close at 236,000 won,
the highest price since May 12.  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. ,
the world’s biggest maker of drill ships, gained 5 percent to
24,200 won. China is the world’s second-largest shipbuilding
nation, lagging behind South Korea, based on orders won this
year.  
 “The stronger yuan will narrow the price gap between
shipyards in China and South Korea, meaning that it won’t be
cheaper to build ships in China anymore,”  Kim Hyun , an analyst
at LIG Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul, said in a phone
interview today.  
 The People’s Bank of China pledged on June 19 to make the
yuan more flexible, ruling out a one-time revaluation of the
currency that’s been held at about 6.83 yuan per dollar since
mid-2008. China and South Korea have won orders for 27.5 million
deadweight tons in the first five months of this year, 82
percent of the global total, according to  Clarkson Plc , the
world’s largest shipbroker.  
 The global economy is “gradually recovering and the upturn
in the Chinese economy has become more solid,” China’s central
bank said in a statement announcing the action.  
 STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. , which owns a shipyard in
Dalian, China, gained 7.8 percent to close at 11,750 won in
Seoul.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. , the world’s
second-largest shipbuilder, advanced 1.9 percent to 19,250 won.
