             New Zealand’s economy will grow in
excess of 3 percent over the next two years on stronger
international demand for the nation’s commodities, according to
a survey of economists.  
 Gross domestic product will rise by 3.2 percent in the year
ending March 31, 2011, according to the average estimate of 10
economists surveyed by the Wellington-based  New Zealand
Institute of Economic Research Inc.  Three months ago, they
forecast a 3.1 percent expansion. Growth will be 3.3 percent in
the year ending March 31, 2012, according to the survey.  
 Low interest rates and a surge in global commodity prices
buoyed business confidence and helped the economy recover from
its worst recession in three decades. Reserve Bank Governor  Alan Bollard  raised the official cash rate this month for the first
time in three years, saying growth is becoming more broad based.  
 Exports will increase 3.5 percent in the year ending March
31, 2011, according to the survey. That’s faster than the 2.7
percent pace predicted in March. Exports will grow 5.3 percent
in the year to March 2012, it showed.  
 Commodity  export prices  surged to a record last month,
according to an index compiled by ANZ National Bank Ltd. Exports
make up 30 percent of the economy.  
 Private consumption will increase 2.5 percent in the
current year and residential investment will surge 18 percent,
following an 11 percent contraction in the year ended March 31,
2010, the survey showed.  
 The economy probably contracted 0.4 percent in the year
ending March 31, according to the survey. The government
 publishes  GDP figures on June 24.  
 The quarterly survey includes the forecasts of the Reserve
Bank, Treasury Department, seven bank economists and the
institute.
