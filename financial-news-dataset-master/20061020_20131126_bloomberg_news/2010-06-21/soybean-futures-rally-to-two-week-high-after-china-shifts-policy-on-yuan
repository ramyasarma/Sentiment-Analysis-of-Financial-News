             Soybeans rose to the highest level
in more than two weeks on speculation that  China  will boost
imports of U.S. crops after ending the yuan’s linkage to the
dollar.  
 The People’s Bank of China said June 19 it will relax the
fixed rate of 6.83 yuan to the dollar because the nation’s
economic recovery has become “cemented” after the global
financial crisis. U.S. exporters sold 120,000 metric tons of
soybeans to China for delivery before Aug. 31, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a statement.  
 “Chances are better for us getting our stuff into China,”
said  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC in
Augusta, Kansas. “They might not follow through, but that was
some positive news.”  
 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 8.5 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $9.39 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
gaining for the fourth straight session. Earlier, the price
touched $9.4725, the highest level for the most-active contract
since June 4. Futures gained 2.3 percent last week, partly as
wet weather delayed seeding of the U.S. crop.  
 The price also gained on speculation that some acres will
be left fallow as excessive rainfall keeps farmers out of
fields. Parts of Iowa and Illinois, the biggest U.S. growers of
soybeans, have received six times the normal rainfall in the
past week, National Weather Service data show.  
 Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued last year
at $31.8 billion, behind corn at $48.6 billion, government
figures show.
