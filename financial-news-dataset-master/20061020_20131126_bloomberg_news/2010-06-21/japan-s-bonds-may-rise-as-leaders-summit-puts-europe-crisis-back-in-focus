             Japan’s bonds rose, pushing yields
toward a one-week low, as Asian stocks declined on concern
Europe’s fiscal crisis will slow global economic growth.  
 Ten-year  bonds  advanced for the third time in four days
after Fitch Ratings downgraded Paris-based BNP Paribas SA and
Standard & Poor’s said Spanish banks face “difficult years.”
Japan’s bonds also gained after European Central Bank governing
council member  Christian Noyer  said some banks in the euro
region have faced funding challenges amid the debt crisis.  
 “As concerns about Europe linger, Japan’s bonds should be
supported,” said  Satoshi Yamada , chief quantitative analyst in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s third-
largest banking group. “Stock losses are prompting investors to
buy bonds.”  
 The yield on the 1.3 percent bond due June 2020 fell 1.5
basis points to 1.205 percent as of 1:05 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.134 yen to 100.846 yen. The yield declined to
1.195 percent on June 18, the lowest since June 10.  
 Ten-year bond futures for September delivery climbed 0.17
to 140.65 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  
 Fitch yesterday cut its long-term credit rating on BNP
Paribas, France’s largest bank, by one step to AA-, citing a
“deterioration” of the company’s asset quality. S&P lowered
its economic growth forecast for Spain to an average of 0.7
percent a year through 2016 from 1 percent, saying the nation’s
banks face “substantial strain” on revenue generation.  
 Stock Losses  
 The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average 1.1 percent. The Nikkei and
10-year yields had a correlation of 0.74 in the past month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A value of 1 would mean
the two moved in lockstep.  
 “Domestic investors with abundant capital are pushing down
yield levels under good supply-demand conditions,”  Akihiko Inoue , chief market analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho Investors
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s second-largest bank, wrote
today in a note to clients.  
 The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.6 trillion yen ($28.6
billion) of two-year notes on June 24. The previous two-year
sale in May drew bids for 3.68 times the amount on offer,
compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 4.73 at the
April auction.
