             Petroleo Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, agreed to pay 420.8 million reais
($240 million) for stakes in two  Sao Martinho SA  ethanol units
as it seeks to triple production of the biofuel in four years.  
 The company’s Petrobras Biocombustivel unit will own 49
percent of Sao Martinho’s Boa Vista mill and SMBJ Agroindustrial
project in the center-western state of Goias through a joint
venture, Petrobras said in a regulatory filing today. PBio, as
the unit is known, will issue the shares within 12 months.  
 Petrobras has agreed to pay 2.5 billion reais for stakes in
ethanol mills in the past six months as part of plans to almost
triple annual output of the alternative fuel to 2.6 billion
liters (686 million gallons) by 2014. The purchases include 45.7
percent of  Acucar Guarani SA , Brazil’s third-largest sugar maker
by market value.  
 The company, based in Rio de Janeiro, said in a separate
statement today that it plans to invest $3.5 billion in biofuels
between 2010 and 2014.
