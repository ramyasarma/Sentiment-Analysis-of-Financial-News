             Japan’s sumo association will decide
on July 4 whether to proceed with the next planned tournament
amid a gambling scandal, Kyodo News reported, citing
Musashigawa, the association’s chairman.  
 An independent investigative panel is questioning 29 sumo
association members who have admitted to gambling on baseball
matches, the report said. The association will decide whether to
hold the Nagoya tournament, scheduled to begin on July 11, after
considering the panel’s report, Kyodo said.
