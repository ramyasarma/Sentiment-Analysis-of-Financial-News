             Arabica-coffee futures fell in New
York on speculation that supplies would be too plentiful next
season to support prices at a 27-month high. Cocoa advanced.  
 Arabica futures rose 11 percent last week, the biggest such
gain since 2006. Global coffee output will climb 11 percent to a
record in the year starting July 1, led by gains in Brazil, the
largest grower, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign
Agricultural Service said last week.  
 “Everything still points downward as expecting a large
crop for Brazil,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision
Financial Markets in Chicago. There’s “nothing bullish longer
term here.”  
 Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 1.3 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $1.608 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $1.6545, the highest level for a
most-active contract since March 6, 2008.  
 Worldwide coffee output will rise to 139.7 million bags
from 125.7 million a year earlier, according to the USDA’s unit.
(A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.)  
 “Whilst markets may ignore the fundamentals, supply will
be coming along, and this cannot be totally ignored,”  Ralph Hawes , a Sucden Financial Ltd. analyst in London, wrote in a
note today.  
 Inventories  monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have fallen 27
percent this year to the lowest level since September 2002.  
 “The price of arabica coffee should continue to be well
supported, even if the current sharp rise is excessive,”
Commerzbank AG analysts wrote in a report e-mailed today, which
noted a forecast that Colombia’s output will remain below its
five-year average. The South American country is the world’s
second-biggest supplier of arabica beans, after Brazil.  
 Robusta-coffee futures for September rose $2, or 0.1
percent, to $1,573 a metric ton on London’s Liffe exchange.  
 In New York, cocoa futures for September delivery advanced
$28, or 0.9 percent, to $2,985 a ton on ICE. On London’s Liffe,
cocoa for July delivery rose 9 pounds, or 0.4 percent, to 2,465
pounds ($3,642) a ton.
