             Amazon.com Inc. cut the price of its
Kindle electronic reader 27 percent to $189, accelerating a
price war with  Barnes & Noble Inc. , the bookstore chain that
earlier announced a discount on its own e-book device, the Nook.  
 The Kindle’s price was cut from $259, Seattle-based
Amazon.com said in a statement. Earlier today, Barnes & Noble
said the Nook, released last year for $259, will sell for $199.  
 While vying with each other, Amazon and Barnes & Noble are
also trying to stave off competition from Apple Inc., maker of
the iPad, which features digital books as well as computing,
video display and Web access.  
 “Their sales have obviously been impacted by the iPad,”
said  Charlie Wolf , a senior analyst at Needham & Co. in New
York. “These price cuts are almost an act of desperation.”  
 Borders Group Inc. , the second-largest U.S. bookstore
chain, recently began selling e-readers for $119.99 to $149.99.
U.S. sales of digital reading devices are projected to reach 5
million units this year from 2.2 million in 2009, according to
the Consumer Electronics Association, an industry trade group.  
 Sales of digital books more than doubled to $27.4 million
in April from a year earlier, while revenue from all forms of
books rose 25 percent to $629.8 million, according to the
Association of American Publishers.  
 Amazon.com slipped $3.28 to $122.55 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. That left the shares down 8.9 percent this year.
Barnes & Noble, based in New York, shed 54 cents to $16.53.  
 Amazon’s Response  
 Borders , the second largest U.S. bookstore chain, began
selling Kobo Inc.’s e-reader in May for $149.99 and a device
from Aluratek Inc. this month for $119.99.  
 Amazon.com, the world’s largest online retailer, isn’t
relying merely on price cuts to contend with Apple. In August,
Amazon.com plans to introduce a thinner Kindle with a more
responsive screen and a sharper picture, people familiar with
the company’s plans said last month.  
 Sony Corp. also sells  digital book readers  for $169.99,
$199.99 and $349.99. Dan Walsh, a spokesman for Sony’s Reader
business, declined to comment when asked about possible price
changes.  
 Barnes & Noble’s $199 e-reader includes access to an
advanced wireless network. The company also offers a Wi-Fi only
version for $149, according to today’s statement.
