             Credit Agricole SA  was sued for at
least $100 million over the creation and sale of a
collateralized debt obligation, according to court papers filed
June 18 in state court in New York.  
 Buyers of notes issued by the CDO, which is named Millstone
IV CDO Ltd., accused two units of Credit Agricole of fraud and
unjust enrichment, according to a summons filed with the court.
CDOs are pools of debt securities sliced up into various
tranches.  
 The plaintiffs -- Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 31 Ltd.
and Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 32 Ltd. -- are seeking the
return of the $50 million purchase price for the notes and
damages of not less than $50 million, according to court papers.  
 A spokesman for Credit Agricole couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.
