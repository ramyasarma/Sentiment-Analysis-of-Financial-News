             AccuWeather Inc. today boosted its
forecast for the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season to 18 to 21
named storms, up from 16 to 18, and said least three will move
through the region affected by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.  
 The worst for the U.S. will come in September,
AccuWeather’s chief hurricane forecaster,  Joe Bastardi , said in
an e-mailed statement. “Expect eight named storms in September
and three or four U.S. impacts,” he said.  
 In 160 years of record-keeping, five years have had 18 or
more storms, AccuWeather said.  
 Forecasters including the U.S. National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration are predicting a more-active tropical
season than usual, in part because of above-normal sea
temperatures west of Africa and a decline in the Pacific cooling
phenomenon known as El Nino, which helps retard Atlantic
hurricane development.  
 NOAA forecast 14 to 23 named storms for the 2010 Atlantic
season. If 23 developed, it would be the second-most on record,
after 2005, when there were 28 named storms, including Hurricane
Katrina.  
 A tropical storm receives a name when sustained winds reach
39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane when winds hits 74 mph,
and is classified a major storm, Category 3 on the five-step
Saffir-Simpson scale, at 111 mph. The season began June 1 and
runs through Nov. 30.  
 ‘Orgy of Naming’  
 Bastardi said the period from Aug. 15 to Oct. 15 may see
“an orgy of naming, two or three going on at once and five in a
15-20 day period.”  
 Three storms, two of them hurricane-level, may pass through
the oil spill area, while three more may come close enough to
affect cleanup operations and other rig activity, Bastardi said.  
 The Gulf is home to about 27 percent of the U.S.’s oil and
15 percent of its natural gas production, the Energy Department
says. It also has seven of the 10 busiest U.S. ports, according
to the Army Corps of Engineers. Florida is the second-largest
producer of oranges after Brazil.  
 The April sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig,
leased by BP Plc, off the coast of Louisiana has caused the
worst oil spill in U.S. history. The company said today the cost
of its spill response has reached $2 billion.
