             Amil Participacoes SA (AMIL3)  rose in Sao
Paulo trading after Banco BTG Pactual SA recommended buying the
shares, saying  Brazil ’s health-care industry will benefit from
economic growth.  
 “We see growth opportunities across the sector,” Pactual
analysts Joao Carlos dos Santos and Pedro Montenegro wrote in a
note to clients on June 18. “Demographics are favorable thanks
to population aging and wage bill growth.”  
 Health insurer Amil’s “stronger earnings power” and
pharmaceutical-distributor  Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos
Farmaceuticos SA ’s “too cheap” valuation earned the companies
“buy” ratings in new coverage at the Rio de Janeiro-based
bank.  
 Brazil’s economy will grow 7.06 percent this year, up from
a week-earlier forecast of 6.99 percent, according to a central
bank survey of about 100 economists published today. Analysts
increased their prediction for economic growth for the 14th
straight week.  
 Amil gained 1.4 percent to 14.70 reais, the highest price
in almost two months. Profarma lost 0.1 percent to 15.25 reais
after earlier increasing as much as 1.5 percent.
