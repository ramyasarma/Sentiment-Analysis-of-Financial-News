             Treasury futures may extend their
drop after evidence that the U.S. economic recovery is losing
momentum failed to push prices above their recent range,
according to CRT Capital Group LLC.  
 “We had some very, very friendly news, and we couldn’t do
a thing with it,”  David Ader , head of government bond strategy
in Stamford, Connecticut, at CRT, said in a telephone interview.
“That should always be an alert that there’s a problem: the
market’s fully priced. The technical patterns are bearish, and
in a vacuum of anything else, it tells me we’re going to take a
step down.”  
 Economic reports last week showing a drop in consumer
prices and housing starts and an increase in unemployment claims
didn’t fuel enough demand for U.S. debt to push futures out of
their range of 114 26/32 to 122 14/32 since the start of March.  
 Treasury futures fell today as China’s signal on June 19
that it would allow a more flexible yuan encouraged confidence
in the global economic recovery and reduced demand for the
safety of government debt.  
 The implied  yield  on 10-year Treasury futures contracts for
September delivery rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.57 percent. The price fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000
face amount, to 120 9/32.  
 The price may fall through a support level of 119 24/32,
Ader wrote in an e-mailed note today. While the level of 119
13/32 is “good for a stall,” momentum may push the price as
low as 118 26/32, according to Ader.  
 “I would like to see it set back a lot in order to buy it
at a cheaper level,” Ader said.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.
