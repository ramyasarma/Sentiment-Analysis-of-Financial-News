             German business confidence probably
fell for a second month in June as Europe’s debt crisis weighed
on the economic outlook.  
 The  Ifo institute  will say its  business climate index ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, decreased to 101.2 from
101.5 in May, according to the median of 38 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News  survey . The index hit a two-year high of 101.6 in
April. Ifo releases the report at 10 a.m. in Munich today.  
 Governments across the 16-nation euro area are cutting
spending after Greece’s near default sparked investor concern
that budget deficits are spiraling out of control. While tighter
fiscal policy may damp economic growth, the crisis has also
pushed the euro down 13 percent against the dollar this year,
boosting German exports outside the currency bloc.  
 “It’s still unclear whether companies will be more
influenced by the likely effects of the debt crisis or the push
for exports from the weaker euro,” said  Carsten Brzeski , an
economist at ING Group in Brussels. Most data point to “the
strong growth dynamic losing steam somewhat,” he said.  
 Ifo’s measure of executives’ expectations will decline to
102.7 from 103.7, the survey of economists shows. The gauge of
the current situation probably increased to 99.8 from 99.4.  
 Raised Forecasts  
 The Bundesbank on June 11 raised its growth forecasts for
Europe’s largest economy even as the government agreed to 80
billion euros ($99 billion) in  budget cuts  over the next four
years. The German central bank predicted expansion of 1.9
percent this year and 1.4 percent in 2011, up from 1.6 percent
and 1.2 percent respectively.  
 Volkswagen AG , Europe’s largest carmaker, said last week
operating profit and deliveries may rise “significantly” this
year as demand increases in major markets and the euro’s decline
against the dollar helps sales abroad.  
 Germany’s benchmark  DAX share index  has rallied 11 percent
in the past month and is up almost six percent this year. Still,
German  investor confidence  plunged this month on concern that
the sovereign debt crisis will undermine demand for the
country’s goods within the euro area, its biggest export market.  
 “We’ll see some effects of the consolidation efforts on
economic growth,” said  Andreas Scheuerle , an economist at
Dekabank in Frankfurt. “But the recovery is not in danger.”
