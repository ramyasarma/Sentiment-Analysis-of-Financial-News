             European Central Bank President 
Jean-Claude Trichet is to urge European politicians to solve 
inefficiencies in the eurozone in remarks that may trigger the 
establishment of an independent agency to monitor and shape 
fiscal developments, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a
speech he is due to make later today.  
 Trichet’s speech will push the idea of an independent 
agency, created under a mandate from the EU and eurozone 
finance ministers, which would act as a watchdog; the agency 
would help shape future fiscal policy and be located within the
European Commission, the newspaper said.
