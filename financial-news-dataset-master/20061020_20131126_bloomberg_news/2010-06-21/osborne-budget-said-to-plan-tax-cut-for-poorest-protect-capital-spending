             Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will reduce income tax for Britain’s poorest workers and
maintain infrastructure spending to cushion the impact of the
biggest  deficit  cuts in a generation, according to a person with
knowledge of the plans.  
 Announcing his budget in Parliament in London today,
Osborne will raise the level above which the lowest rate of
income tax is levied by 1,000 pounds ($1,478) to 7,475 pounds,
exempting 880,000 low earners from payment, the person said.  
 In raising the tax ceiling, Osborne is adopting a policy of
the Liberal Democrats, junior partner in a coalition with
Osborne’s Conservatives. The chancellor will also protect
spending on school buildings, hospitals and similar projects
from further budget cuts, in an effort to convince voters that
ordinary Britons won’t suffer unduly as a result of the deficit-
busting plan, the person said.  
 Documents prepared for publication today will show that the
poor will pay least, the middle classes won’t bear most of the
cost and only the very rich will pay significantly more, the
person said.  
 Osborne is seeking to prevent the loss of Britain’s top
grade investment rating with measures that the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies  estimates  will slice 85 billion
pounds ($126 billion) off the budget, equivalent to 5.7 percent
of gross domestic product, to eliminate the shortfall by 2015.  
 Osborne has already pledged to give new companies a one-
year payroll-tax break to encourage economic growth outside
Britain’s most prosperous regions, according to a person with
knowledge of the plans.  
 The 900 million-pound program will exempt new companies
with fewer than 10 workers from making National Insurance
contributions. The program will last three years and apply to
workers earning less than 44,800 pounds a year in all of the
U.K. apart from London, eastern and southeast England, the
person said.
