             France plans to raise the question
of the regulation of commodity derivatives with G-20 nations,
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde wrote in an article in
Les Echos.  
 France will seek progress on the subject during its
presidency of the G-20, Lagarde wrote. Europe should regulate
commodity derivatives, including those based on carbon dioxide
quotas, and France plans to send a “reflexion document” to the
European Commission in coming months, Lagarde wrote.
