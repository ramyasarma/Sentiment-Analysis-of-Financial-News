             Japan Airlines Corp. may end an
information technology partnership with IBM Japan Ltd. in a move
to cut costs, Nikkei English News reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  
 The partnership began in 2000, when IBM Japan acquired a
stake in JAL Information Technology Co., Nikkei said. IBM Japan
has a 51 percent stake in the operation, while JAL owns 41
percent, and other shareholders the remaining 8 percent.
