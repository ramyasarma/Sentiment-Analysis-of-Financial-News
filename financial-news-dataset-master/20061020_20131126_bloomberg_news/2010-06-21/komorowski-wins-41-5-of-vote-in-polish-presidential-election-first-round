             Acting President Bronislaw
Komorowski won the first round of Poland’s presidential election
with 41.5 percent of the vote, falling short of the absolute
majority needed to avoid a runoff, the State Elections Committee
said today, summarizing final results of yesterday’s election.  
 Komorowski, the candidate of Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s
Civic Platform party, will face Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader
of Poland’s largest opposition party Law & Justice, who received
36.5 percent of the vote, the Committee said at a news briefing
in Warsaw. Grzegorz Napieralski of the Left Democratic Alliance
was third with 13.7 percent of the vote, based on returns from
100 percent of the country’s voting districts.
