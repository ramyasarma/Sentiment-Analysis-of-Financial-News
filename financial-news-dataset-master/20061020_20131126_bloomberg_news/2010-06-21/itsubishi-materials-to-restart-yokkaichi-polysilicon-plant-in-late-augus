             Mitsubishi Materials Corp. will
restart a polysilicon plant in Yokkaichi, central Japan, in late
August after improving facilities in compliance with safety
regulations.  
 The Japanese company expects full-year net income to
decline by 3 billion yen because of the closure, according to a
statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The company had
previously forecast a 4 billion yen decrease.  
 Separately, Mitsubishi Materials will open a new
polysilicon plant in the same area in late July.
