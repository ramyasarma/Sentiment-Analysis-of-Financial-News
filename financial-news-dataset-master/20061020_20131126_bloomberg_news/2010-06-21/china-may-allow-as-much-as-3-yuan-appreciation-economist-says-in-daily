             China may allow the yuan to
appreciate by as much as 3 percent if the country’s exports rise
by 20 percent next year and the global recovery continues, the
China Daily cited Zhou Shijian, an economist at Tsinghua
University.  
 A rapid rise in the Chinese currency would be a “death
knell” for exporters, Zhou said in a printed forum in the
newspaper. Yuan appreciation between October 2007 and July 2008
caused about 67,000 bankruptcies in the export sector, Zhou
said.
