             Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan
appointed Barth Nnaji to head a presidential task force on power
issues in the West African nation.  
 The group, which will develop strategies for “rapid
improvement of power generation, transmission and distribution
in the country,” will include the managing directors of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp, and Power Holding Co. of
Nigeria, presidential spokesman Ima Niboro said in an e-mailed
statement today.   
 Blackouts are a daily occurrence in Nigeria, where demand
for electricity is almost double the current supply.
