             BlueCrest Capital Market LLP,
Europe’s third-largest hedge fund firm, raised 349 million
pounds ($517 million) with a share issue, double its target, in
the largest such listing in two years.  
 BlueCrest, which manages about $19 billion in hedge funds
from London and Geneva, raised the money with a so-called C-
share listing for its  BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Ltd. , which invests
in BlueCrest funds. A C-share listing doesn’t dilute the
holdings of existing investors.  
 The sale is the largest share capital raise for a hedge
fund since May 2008 and will make the fund the third-largest
listed in London with assets of 809 million pounds, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc research.  
 “This tells you that there’s still ample demand for the
listed hedge-fund structure,” said  Mark James , who heads sales
and research for the investment funds team at RBS, which helped
arrange the sale. “There’s a scale issue. The larger the funds
get the more liquid they get” making them easier to trade.  
 The listing became possible after the AllBlue funds began
trading at a  premium  to net asset value all this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.
