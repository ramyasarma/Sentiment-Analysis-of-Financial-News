             Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s
second-largest mobile-phone maker, aims to more than double its
share of the smartphone market, helped by the introduction of
its  Galaxy S  model.  
 Samsung intends to raise its market share for smartphones
to more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter from its current
level of less than 5 percent,  Lee Donjoo , senior vice president
of company’s Mobile Communications Division, said in an
interview in Seoul yesterday.  
 A 10 percent market share may lift Samsung’s ranking among
smartphone makers to fourth from fifth, surpassing Taoyuan,
Taiwan-based  HTC Corp. , which had a 7 percent share in the
fourth quarter of 2009 according to an April 20 CLSA Ltd. report.
Nokia Oyj, the largest smartphone maker has a 40 percent share.
Global sales of smartphones will rise 36 percent to 247 million
handsets in 2010, research firm ISuppli Corp. said in April.  
 “Samsung may easily meet the target as the handset market
is sharply transferring to smartphones and the hardware features
of the Galaxy S are pretty competitive in the market,” said  Lee Sun Tae , a senior analyst at Meritz Securities Co. Ltd. in Seoul.  
 Samsung is now “more optimistic” about its 2010
smartphone sales, which may exceed initial targets, Lee said.
“The market response to the Galaxy S from Europe is good,” he
said, without elaborating.  
 Shipment Target  
 The Galaxy S, which runs on  Google Inc .’s Android operating
system, went on sale last week in some European countries. The
phone has a 4-inch display screen, bigger than the iPhone’s 3.5-
inch screen, as well as an e-book reader, a 5-megapixel camera,
and a high-definition video recorder and player, according to
the company’s  website . About 110 mobile operators around the
world will offer the phone, Lee said.  
 Samsung , which shipped 227 million mobile phones in 2009,
said Feb. 4 it aims to triple shipments of smartphones this year
from 6 million, without providing specific figures.  
 Suwon, South Korea-based  Samsung  dropped 1.8 percent to
815,000 won as of 10:12 a.m. Seoul time. The benchmark  Kospi 
index fell 0.7 percent.  
 Samsung plans to offer a tablet computer, to be called the
Galaxy Tab, in the third quarter, Lee said, without giving
details of the operating system or features.
