             Abbott Laboratories  sued  Novartis 
AG’s Sandoz unit to block sale of a generic copy of Niaspan, a
drug used to increase so-called good cholesterol, accusing its
Swiss rival of infringing three patents.  
 The Novartis unit applied to the  U.S. Food and Drug
Administration  for approval of the generic and wrongfully
intends to market a version of the patent-protected drug, Abbott
said a complaint filed June 18 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  
 Sandoz “had actual and constructive knowledge” of the
patents, and “Abbott will suffer substantial and irreparable
harm” unless the infringement is stopped, Abbott’s  lawyers  said
in court papers.  
 Abbott said in April that first-quarter sales of  Niaspan , a
form a Vitamin B, rose 15 percent to $205 million. The Abbott
Park, Illinois-based company reported revenue of $30.7 billion
in 2009.  
 “Sandoz can’t comment on pending litigation,” Lauren
Cohen, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail.  
 Abbott  fell 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.30 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen
10.5 percent this year.  
 Novartis  rose 45 centimes to 54.50 Swiss francs in Zurich
trading.  
 The case is Abbott Laboratories v. Sandoz Inc., 10CV538,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
