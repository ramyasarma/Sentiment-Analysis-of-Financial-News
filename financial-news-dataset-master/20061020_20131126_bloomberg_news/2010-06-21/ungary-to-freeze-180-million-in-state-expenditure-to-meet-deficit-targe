             Hungary’s government is freezing 40
billion forint ($180 million) in state spending to help meet its
pledge to international creditors to reduce the budget deficit.  
 Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s administration, which took
office on May 29, ordered spending freezes at all eight
ministries and several public agencies, according to  Magyar
Kozlony , the official outlet for government decrees, in its
issue for the period through July 18.  
 Hungary this month pledged to stick to a deficit target of
3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year, approved by the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union. Officials
earlier this month rattled world markets by saying Hungary was
nearing a Greece-like debt crisis.  
 The budget deficit reached 84.6 percent of the annual
target by the end of May, the government said on June 7. Orban’s
administration plans to save 120 billion forint by freezing
public spending and by overhauling wages for state workers.
Hungary also wants to raise 187 billion forint with a new tax on
the financial industry.
