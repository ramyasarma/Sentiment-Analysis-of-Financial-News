             German tax revenue so far this year
is higher than forecast as the  economy’s recovery  gathers steam,
the Finance Ministry said.  
 Tax revenue in the first five months dropped 1.8 percent
from the same period a year earlier, less than the 2.6 percent
decline the government has budgeted for 2010, the ministry said
today. In May, tax intake rose 1.6 percent, the second straight
monthly increase after falling for 14 straight months.  
 “Current indicators suggest that the economic recovery is
strengthening gradually,” the Berlin ministry said in its
monthly report. Gross domestic product in the second quarter
will accelerate at a “clearly” faster pace than in the first
three months, when it expanded 0.2 percent, it said.  
 Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  has said he may need to
borrow around 65 billion euros ($80.4 billion) this year instead
of the 80.2 billion euros targeted in the budget plan. The so-
called  structural deficit  -- the shortfall in average economic
times, estimated at 53 billion euros this year -- still has to
be cut to 10 billion euros by 2016, the ministry’s report said.  
 The economy’s recovery has lessened the need to cut jobs in
the manufacturing industry and helped reduce short-time work,
the ministry said. The number of people on government-subsidized
shortened shifts fell to 693,000 in March from 1.52 million in
May 2009, it said.
