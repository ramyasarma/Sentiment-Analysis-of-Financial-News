             Randon SA Implementos e
Participacoes , a Brazilian maker of specialty vehicles and auto
parts, rose the most in more than a month after making a record
sale of a rail product.  
 Randon agreed to sell 1,150 Hopper railcars to MRC Solucoes
em Logistica Ferroviaria Vnte-Al Ltda, according to a regulatory
filing June 18 after markets closed. The sale will boost
Randon’s share in that market to 30 percent from 18 percent, and
may lead the company to revise its sales guidance upward,
according to Banco Santander SA.  
 “With this announcement, we indeed see a recovery of
Brazil’s railcar market,” analysts including  Daniel Gewehr 
wrote in a note to clients. Santander reiterated its
recommendation to buy the shares.  
 Randon jumped 5.2 percent, the most on an intraday basis
since May 10, to 10.07 reais at 1:57 p.m. New York time in Sao
Paulo trading.
