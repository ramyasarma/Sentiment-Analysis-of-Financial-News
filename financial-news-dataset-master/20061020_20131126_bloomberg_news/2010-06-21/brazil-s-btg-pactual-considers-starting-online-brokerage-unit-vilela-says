             BTG Pactual CTVM SA , Brazil’s
fourth-largest stock brokerage by traded volume, is considering
starting an online brokerage business focused on individual
investors.  
 “It’s possible that we’ll work in that market,” said  Jose Miguel Vilela XFQL496HOOYK"></a>  
 BTG Pactual traded 80 billion reais ($46 billion) in stocks
from January to May in Sao Paulo, according to data compiled by
BM&FBovespa SA, controller of Latin America’s largest exchange.  
 Vilela said it’s “premature” to say whether BTG Pactual
will start the new unit through an acquisition or by developing
the business by itself.  
 “We’ll seek leadership in everything related to the equity
market,” he said in a telephone interview from New York on June
17.
