             OAO Gazprom is maintaining a
reduction in gas supplies to Belarus after the country offered
to settle the debt with a two-week delay, and will continue
internal talks tomorrow, Sergei Kupriyanov said.  
 “No one will wait two weeks,” he said today by telephone.
“It’s clear 15 percent is only the beginning.”
