             Crude oil rose to the highest level
in six weeks on speculation that demand may expand as China, the
world’s fastest-growing energy-consuming country, said it would
end the yuan’s fixed rate to the dollar.  
 Oil climbed above $78 a barrel after the People’s Bank of
China indicated yesterday that it’s abandoning the yuan peg
adopted during the global financial crisis to shield exporters,
a move that may boost the country’s purchasing power. It didn’t
provide a timeframe for the change.  
 “The rise today is based on the revaluation of the yuan,”
said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank AG
in Washington. “A prospect of a stronger yuan and a weaker
dollar is giving most markets a boost.”  
 Oil for July delivery rose 59 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$77.77 a barrel at the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures touched $78.92, the
highest level since May 6. Prices have climbed 12 percent in the
past year.  
 China, the world’s most populous nation,  consumes  more oil
than any country except the U.S. China’s central bank said
there’s no basis for “large-scale” moves in its currency even
as it pledged increased exchange-rate flexibility.  
 The euro touched $1.2487, the highest level since May 24,
in earlier trading, boosting the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment. The euro was down 0.5 percent at 2:30
p.m. at $1.2327, causing oil prices to pare gains.  
 Currencies  
 The yuan climbed the most since July 2005 against the
dollar after China’s central bank relaxed its two-year peg to
the U.S. currency before a Group of 20 summit this week.  
 “The impact of cheaper oil for Chinese consumers and the
stimulus for imports is what is pushing prices up,” said
 Christopher Bellew , senior broker at Bache Commodities Ltd. in
London.  
 The  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities advanced
0.3 percent to 263.65, the first increase in three days. Nine of
the commodities increased, including crude and heating oil.  
 Equities gained, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
rising for a third day on the Chinese plan. The S&P 500 climbed
0.4 percent to 1,121.79, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
jumped 60.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,511.33.  
 Brent crude for August settlement advanced 55 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $78.77 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  
 Fund Buying  
 “You’re starting to see some hedge funds coming back into
the market as the market starts to reach some technical
levels,” said  Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC in Houston. “At some point between $80 and $85 you have a
fair price of oil.”  
 Hedge funds increased their long positions in crude oil by
the most in almost four months as prices advanced on speculation
that U.S. economic growth will accelerate, bolstering
consumption.  
 Net-long positions by managed money in crude-oil futures
and options on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 32 percent
to 97,963 in the week ended June 15, the biggest percentage gain
since Feb. 16, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders Report on June 18.  
 U.S. inventories of crude oil probably dropped in the seven
days ended June 18 on estimates that imports declined for the
first time in three weeks, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  
 Stockpiles  fell 1.5 million barrels from 363.1 million the
week before, according to the median of seven analyst  forecasts 
before an Energy Department report this week. Six of the
respondents forecast a decrease and one estimated a gain.  
 Inventories  
 Supplies of crude oil climbed 1.69 million barrels in the
week ended June 11, last week’s report showed.  Imports  increased
1.7 percent to 9.7 million barrels a day.  
 Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 453,899
contracts as of 2:30 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 459,249
contracts June 18, 41 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.28 million contracts, the
lowest level since March 1.
