             Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the
lender to the owners of Florida’s Sawgrass Marriott Resort,
failed to win bankruptcy court permission to take over and sell
the company’s assets.  
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Paul M. Glenn  in Jacksonville,
Florida, today denied Goldman’s request to lift the automatic
stay, a part of the bankruptcy code that shields a company from
creditors’ efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs
Mortgage is a division of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.   
 Goldman Sachs Commercial Mortgage Capital LP helped finance
the $220.5 million purchase of the 65-acre resort in Ponte Vedra
Beach by RQB Resort LP and RQB Development. New York-based
Goldman Sachs, owed about $192.5 million as of Jan. 10, hasn’t
been paid since August.  
 The property, purchased in 2006, was valued at $135.3
million in an appraisal ordered by Goldman. David J. O’Halloran,
chief executive officer for RQB’s U.S. operation, told the court
the group believes the resort should be valued in the
$90 million to $100 million range.  
 RQB Resort listed assets and debt of as much as $500
million each in Chapter 11 documents filed March 1 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. RQB Development also sought
protection.  
 RQB sought and received a six-month extension of the
exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. The new deadline
is Dec. 29.  
 RQB Resort is the exclusive partner to the PGA Tour’s
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, known as TPC Sawgrass,
court papers show. The 508-room hotel resort has rights to
85 percent of the starting times each day to the Players
Stadium Course through 2089.

 Tiger Woods  made his Feb. 19 apology for his marital
infidelity at the TPC Sawgrass golf club.  
 The course was ranked ninth on Golf Digest’s list of
America’s 100 Greatest Public Courses for 2009-2010. The TPC
Sawgrass is known for its 17th hole, where World Golf Hall of
Fame architect Peter Dye placed the green on an island in a
small lake.  
 Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs Group,
declined to comment on the judge’s ruling.  
 Shares of New York-based Goldman Sachs fell 44 cents to
$137.74 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15
p.m.  
 The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville).
