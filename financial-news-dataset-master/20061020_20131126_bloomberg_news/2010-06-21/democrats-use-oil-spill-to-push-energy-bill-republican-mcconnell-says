             President  Barack Obama  and
Democratic lawmakers are trying to “seize on a crisis” to pass
a “national energy tax,” Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  said.  
 Legislation that charges power plants, factories and oil
refineries for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
released into the atmosphere “doesn’t have anything to do with
an oil spill in the Gulf,”  McConnell, a Kentucky Republican,
said yesterday on the “Fox News Sunday” program.  
 Senate Democrats plan to bring up legislation next month
that responds to the  BP Plc  oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and
boosts alternative energy sources such as windmills and solar
panels.  
 They are split over whether the energy bill should also
impose limits on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
scientists have linked to climate change. The U.S. House
narrowly passed cap-and-trade legislation last year in which
companies would buy and sell a declining number of carbon
dioxide allowances.  
 President  Barack Obama ’s goal is “to pass a comprehensive
energy bill that reduces our dependence on foreign oil, makes
key investments in the areas of alternative energy” and “deals
fundamentally with the environmental degradation that happens
from carbon pollution,” White House Chief of Staff  Rahm Emanuel 
said on ABC’s “This Week.”  
 Obama Energy Meeting  
 Obama is scheduled to meet June 23 with senators from both
parties to discuss the energy bill, said  Bill Burton , the White
House deputy press secretary. In an Oval Office address last
week, Obama called for new laws to “change how we produce and
use energy.” Obama didn’t insist that the Senate pass the House
bill and said he’s open to “other ideas.”  
 If legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions from
nearly every part of the U.S. economy can’t pass this year, then
lawmakers should consider a compromise proposal that caps
greenhouse gases from utilities, Senator  Joe Lieberman , a
Connecticut independent, said on CNN’s “State of the Union”
program.  
 “That’s a significant step forward to a better, safer
country,” said Lieberman, the co-author of a proposal that
would charge factories and oil refineries as well as power
plants a price for releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
