             Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Arab region’s
biggest economy and holder of the world’s largest proven crude
oil reserves, has the highest level of investor confidence in
the region, according to an  HSBC Holdings Plc  survey.  
 Saudi Arabia  scored 97, the highest level since 2007, while
the United Arab Emirates’ index is 78.4, according to the HSBC
GCC Business Confidence Survey released today. The overall index
climbed by more than 15 points to 86 from the first quarter of
2009, HSBC said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “These results show a mood of realistic optimism in the
GCC,” Simon Vaughan Johnson, regional head of Commercial
Banking Middle East North Africa said in the statement. “Many
companies are doing better than they were 12 months ago, but
they do not see another boom on the horizon. This realistic
perspective is predicting steady and sustainable growth.”  
 Of the 1,491 respondents to the online survey, 33 percent
plan to increase investment, 43 percent expect higher business
turnover and 40 percent predict a rise in net income in 2010,
according to the statement.  
 A score below 100 indicates confidence is lower than the
first quarter of 2007, the statement said.
