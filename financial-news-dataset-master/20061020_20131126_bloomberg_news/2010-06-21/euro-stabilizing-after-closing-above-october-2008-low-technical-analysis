             The euro’s close last week above an
October 2008 low against the dollar signals the currency is
stabilizing after a decline this year, according to Citigroup
Inc., citing technical analysis.  
 “We have stepped back from the short-term bearish
stance,” technical analysts including  Tom Fitzpatrick  in New
York wrote in a note to clients, saying they now have “overall
a neutral outlook at this stage.”  
 The 16-nation currency closed at $1.2388 on June 18, above
an Oct. 28, 2008, low of $1.2330. After reaching that level, it
appreciated to as much as $1.4719 on Dec. 18, 2008, before
falling again.  
 The euro traded today at $1.2384 after earlier touching
$1.2487, the highest level since May 24. It has dropped 14
percent versus the greenback this year, touching a four-year low
of $1.1877 on June 7 amid concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
may derail the global recovery.  
 The shared currency now faces short-term resistance at
$1.2510 and $1.2673, the Citigroup analysts wrote. Resistance is
an area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered.  
 In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.
