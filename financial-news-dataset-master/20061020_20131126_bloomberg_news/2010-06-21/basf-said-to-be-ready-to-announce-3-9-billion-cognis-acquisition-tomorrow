             BASF SE , the world’s largest
chemicals maker, is poised to announce the purchase of Cognis
GmbH for at least 3.1 billion euros ($3.9 billion) as soon as
tomorrow, two people with knowledge of the discussions said.  
 BASF clinched the purchase of Monheim, Germany-based
Cognis, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Permira Advisers LLP
spurned an offer valued at as much as 3.3 billion euros from
 Lubrizol Corp. , said the people, who spoke on condition of
anonymity because the discussions aren’t public.  
 BASF, based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, would gain specialty
chemicals used in cosmetics and personal care products that are
growing faster its than low-margin petrochemical products. BASF,
whose chief executive officer  Juergen Hambrecht  plans to step
down next year, spent more than two months working on the deal,
which would be among the biggest in the industry this year.  
 Cognis drew bidders with its ingredients for body lotions
and shampoos based on natural resources such as palm kernels and
coconut oil, as opposed to synthetic materials, tapping demand
for environmentally friendly products. The former  Henkel AG  unit
was sold to Goldman and Permira in 2001.  
 Goldman and Permira rejected Lubrizol’s bid because the
Cognis owners had an agreement to conduct exclusive talks with
BASF, one of the people said. BASF spokesman  Thomas Nonnast 
declined to comment.  
 The largest maker of thickeners for personal-care products
such as lotion and shampoo, Wickliffe, Ohio-based Lubrizol has a
market value of $6.19 billion. An acquisition of Cognis would
have eclipsed the largest previous Lubrizol deal, the 2004
purchase of Noveon International Inc. for about $1.84 billion in
cash and assumed debt, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  
 The  Financial Times Deutschland  reported today that
representatives from Cognis’s owners plan to meet BASF
management tomorrow to hammer out final terms of the transaction
and sign a purchase agreement then, most likely at BASF’s
headquarters, according to a person familiar with the talks.
