             BP Plc  diverted 23,290 barrels of
oil from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well to ships on the surface
yesterday, an 11 percent increase from June 19, when part of the
operation was shut down.  
 The drillship Discoverer Enterprise captured 14,570
barrels, an increase after it was shut for 10 hours by an
equipment failure and a lightning storm, BP said in a  statement 
today on its website. About 8,720 barrels were burned aboard the
Q4000 oil rig, a reduction from June 19 as the vessel turned to
accommodate shifts in wind direction.  
 Oil is flowing from the well at a rate of 35,000 barrels a
day to 60,000 barrels a day, a government-led scientific team
said June 15. Total costs of the spill response, including
collection, cleanup and relief wells to permanently plug the
leak have risen to $2 billion, London-based BP said in a
separate statement.  
 BP said it is continuing to install lines that will connect
the well to the Helix Producer I, a ship capable of processing
another 25,000 barrels of oil daily from the well and loading it
aboard a tanker for shipment. That option is scheduled to be
available at the end of June or early July, bringing its total
oil-capturing capacity to more than 50,000 barrels a day, BP
said.  
 BP  fell  7.9 pence, or 2.2 percent, to 349.5 pence at 4:35
p.m. in London. The shares have fallen 47 percent since the well
blew out April 20, destroying the Deepwater Horizon drilling
rig, killing 11 members of its crew and triggering the biggest
oil spill in U.S. history.
