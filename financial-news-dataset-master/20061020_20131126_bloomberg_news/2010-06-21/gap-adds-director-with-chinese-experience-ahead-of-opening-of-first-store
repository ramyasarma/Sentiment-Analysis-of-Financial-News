             Gap Inc. , the operator of
Banana Republic and Old Navy clothing chains, added a
banking executive with experience in China to its board as
it prepares to open a first store in that country.  
 Katherine Tsang , 53, is chairperson for Greater China
operations at  Standard Chartered Plc , a London-based
lender. She will join Gap on Aug. 16, expanding the number
of  directors  to 11, the San Francisco-based retailer said
today in a statement.  
 The company plans to open a Gap brand store in China
this year to tap a growing middle class. China’s economy
expanded 11.9 percent in the first quarter, more than
triple the pace of the U.S., as domestic consumption rose
and exports decreased. Retail sales rose 19 percent in May.  
 “Katherine’s successful track record leading and
growing a multinational business in China’s flourishing
consumer market makes her a tremendous resource to our
board as we embark on a new phase of international
expansion,” Gap Chief Executive Officer  Glenn Murphy  said
in the statement.  
 Chinese consumers may also have more buying power
after China’s central bank ended a two-year peg to the
dollar yesterday. Today, the yuan rose the most since a
July 2005 revaluation.
