             Malaysian Airline System Bhd. , whose
Airbus SAS A380s are more than four years late, said it “cannot
tolerate” any further delays in deliveries of the aircraft.  
 “We are not happy,” Chief Executive Officer  Tengku Azmil Zahruddin  told reporters in Kelana Jaya, outside Kuala Lumpur,
today. “We will not rule anything out at this stage,” he said
when asked whether the carrier may consider scrapping contracts.  
 Malaysian Air is in discussions with Airbus about its six
on-order A380s and it hopes to conclude the talks by the end of
this year, Tengku Azmil said. The carrier’s first A380 is due in
the second quarter of 2012, following at least three delays,
after difficulties including with cabin wiring disrupted
production plans for the world’s largest commercial aircraft.  
 “We cannot tolerate another postponement,” said Malaysian
Air Chairman  Munir Abdul Majid . “We are pretty firm with
Airbus.”  
 The first of the carrier’s A380s was originally due in
2007, before being delayed to January 2011 and then to the third
quarter of 2011. The delivery was pushed back to 2012 earlier
this year.  
 “We are sorry about the delays, which have been a knock-on
effect from the year 2009, but we are confident that we can meet
the revised delivery schedule,” said  Stefan Schaffrath , an
Airbus spokesman in Toulouse, France.  
 Malaysian Air  rose 1.9 percent to 2.17 ringgit at 3:21 p.m.
local time, beating a 1.3 percent rise for the country’s
benchmark stock  index .  
 The carrier said in December that it had been awarded 330
million ringgit ($104 million) in compensation from Airbus for
earlier delays.  
 Airbus, the world’s biggest maker of commercial aircraft,
began deliveries of the A380 in 2007. The company has spent at
least 18 billion euros ($22 billion) developing the plane, or 50
percent more than originally projected, and has struggled in
meeting demands for features such as showers, enclosed suites
and custom lighting.
