             The Japanese government should
consider raising taxes on consumption and high income earners to
restore the nation’s fiscal health, a Finance Ministry advisory
panel said.  
 The government “needs to spread the tax burden more
widely” by increasing its reliance on the sales tax, according
to a report released by a private-sector advisory panel released
in Tokyo today.  
 The findings reinforce Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s calls to
increase levies to finance increasing social welfare costs and a
 debt  burden approaching twice the size of the  economy . Kan
indicated last week the sales tax may need to be doubled to 10
percent as sovereign credit risks come under scrutiny amid
Europe’s financial woes.  
 Kan’s administration is expected to release its mid-term
fiscal plan today before the premier attends the Group of 20
summit of leaders this week.
