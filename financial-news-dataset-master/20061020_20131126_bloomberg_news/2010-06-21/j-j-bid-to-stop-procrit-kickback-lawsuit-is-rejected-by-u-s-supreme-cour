             The  U.S. Supreme Court  rejected an
appeal by a  Johnson & Johnson  unit, refusing to stop a lawsuit
by a former sales representative who says the company gave
doctors kickbacks for prescribing its Procrit anemia drug.  
 The suit, filed under a whistleblower law known as the U.S.
False Claims Act, says that kickbacks paid by J&J’s Ortho
Biotech Products unit led to inflated reimbursements under the
federal Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.  
 Ortho contended in its appeal that whistleblower Mark
Eugene Duxbury couldn’t sue because similar allegations had
already been disclosed in a previous lawsuit. The False Claims
Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government
and then share in any recovery.  
 In rejecting the appeal, the justices took the advice of
the Obama administration, which told the court that recent
changes in the False Claims Act would limit the practical
significant of the case.  
 A federal appeals court in Boston said Duxbury could pursue
his suit, filed in November 2003. The panel said Duxbury met the
law’s requirement that he be an “original source” of the
allegations because he provided the government with his
information about the company before filing suit.  
 Ortho argued that Duxbury should have informed the
government before other plaintiffs filed an earlier lawsuit. The
company’s appeal had the support of the American Hospital
Association.  
 J&J is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  
 The case is Ortho Biotech v. United States ex rel. Duxbury,
09-654.
