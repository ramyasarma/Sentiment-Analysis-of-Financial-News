             Counterfeit versions of  Pfizer
Inc. ’s Viagra were found in two Australian states, prompting a
nationwide search for the source of the fake medicine.  
 At least 776 packs of the phony erection pills were
identified in the southeastern states of New South Wales and
Victoria after customers complained that the blue diamond-
shaped pills were ineffective, said Maida Talhami, a Sydney-
based  Pfizer  spokeswoman. Tests showed they contained incorrect
amounts of sildenafil, Viagra’s active ingredient, Australia’s
Therapeutic Goods Administration said in a  statement  today.  
 It’s the first time fake copies of Viagra are reported to
have entered Australia’s pharmaceutical supply chain, Talhami
said. Counterfeits with the same batch number seized in other
countries have been traced to China, suggesting it is the most
likely source, she said. Viagra, with global sales of $1.9
billion, was New York-based Pfizer’s  fifth best-selling 
medication in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 “There is no evidence that the product represents a safety
hazard, but it is likely to be ineffective,” the Canberra-based
drugs regulator said in an e-mailed statement. The agency has
advised pharmacists to quarantine packs bearing the batch number
314 833 021 with an expiry date of 04/2012, it said.
