             Infineon Technologies AG  could spend
as much as 2.5 billion euros ($3 billion) on acquisitions,
Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing Chief Financial
Officer  Marco Schroeter .  
 Acquisitions of a “certain size” make sense and the
company has no concrete plans, Schroeter told the newspaper in
an interview. The CFO declined to comment on reports that the
company is considering selling its wireless-chip operations.
