             Gold rose to a record in London and
New York as other commodities gained on speculation demand for
raw materials will increase and as investors bought the metal to
protect wealth from Europe’s financial turbulence.  
 China, the world’s third-largest economy, said it may allow
the yuan to move higher, making commodities priced in other
currencies less expensive for Chinese consumers. Bullion gained
in eight of the past nine weeks on speculation debt-cutting
measures by European nations will slow expansions. Other
precious metals rose to the highest levels in at least a month.  
 “Gold is benefiting from other commodities,” said  Jesper Dannesboe , a senior commodity strategist at Societe Generale SA
in London. The China news “is a catalyst, a trigger for buying
today. People are still worried about sovereign debt levels.”  
 Gold, up 15 percent this year, is heading for its 10th
consecutive annual gain, the longest winning streak since at
least 1920. Bullion has outperformed other commodities as global
equities slipped, and this month reached all-time highs in
euros, sterling and Swiss francs. Holdings in exchange-traded
funds backed by gold reached records, while coin sales from
mints accelerated, tightening supplies.  
 Gold for immediate delivery added as much as $8.50, or 0.7
percent, to $1,265.30 an ounce and traded at $1,261.05 at 1:18
p.m. in London. It surpassed the previous all-time high of
$1,262.50 set June 18. The metal for August delivery was 0.3
percent higher at $1,261.90 on the Comex in New York after
reaching $1,266.50.  
 Bullion rose to $1,259.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,256 at the afternoon fixing on June 18.  
 Stronger Yuan  
 A stronger yuan will help curb inflation in the world’s
third-largest economy and shift investment toward service
industries from export-manufacturing, the People’s Bank of China
said yesterday. Chinese authorities had prevented the currency
from strengthening against the dollar since July 2008 to help
exporters cope with the global financial crisis.  
 “The impact on China in the short term will be neutral for
gold prices,”  Wallace Ng , executive director with Fortis
Nederland NV in Hong Kong, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television. A stronger yuan will benefit gold prices in the
longer term because it will increase the purchasing power of
Chinese investors, he said.  
 The dollar was little changed against the euro today,
rebounding from a loss of as much as 0.8 percent. All six main
industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange rose and crude
oil futures climbed in New York.  
 Russia Buying  
 The  MSCI World Index  of equities is down 3.8 percent this
year, and raw materials as measured by the Reuters-Jefferies CRB
Index have slid 6.5 percent. Returns on benchmark U.S.
Treasuries have gained 4.5 percent this year.  
 Russia’s central bank bought 26.6 metric tons of gold in
the past quarter, taking holdings to 668.6 tons, and the
Philippines increased holdings by 9.5 tons in March to 164.7
tons, the World Gold Council said on June 18. The Saudi Arabian
Monetary Authority reported last quarter that it “modified from
first quarter 2008” its holdings to 322.9 tons, from 143 tons
after adjusting accounts, the council said.  
 “This creates speculation that Asian and Middle Eastern
central banks want to own more gold,” Societe Generale’s
Dannesboe said. “It just adds to the bullish story.”  
 Bullion has advanced in 2010 even as the dollar, which
usually moves inversely to gold, has strengthened as the euro
slumped on concern about sovereign finances in Europe. The
single European currency has dropped 13 percent against the
dollar this year.  
 ‘Strong Interest’  
 Gold reached a record 1,051.27 euros an ounce, 870.65
British pounds and 1,451.16 Swiss francs on June 8, Bloomberg
data show.  
 “It is clear that there is extremely strong interest in
gold,” said  Gavin Wendt , senior resource analyst with MineLife
Pty Ltd. in Sydney. “This is all a direct consequence of
investors seeing gold as a more attractive investment class, and
this trend will only continue to grow.”  
 Assets in the  SPDR Gold Trust , the biggest exchange-traded
fund backed by bullion, were unchanged at a record 1,307.96 tons
on June 18, according to the company’s website. Global  holdings 
of the metal by ETFs increased 0.2 ton to an all-time high
2,044.87 tons on June 18, according to Bloomberg data tracking
10 providers.  
 Silver for immediate delivery in London climbed as much as
1.5 percent to a five-week high of $19.4675 an ounce and last
traded at $19.4175. Platinum gained 1.1 percent to $1,605.57 an
ounce, the highest price in a month, and palladium was up 2.8
percent at $503.75 an ounce, also the highest price in a month.
