             Copper advanced, gaining by the
most in a month, as China signaled an end to the yuan’s fixed
rate to the dollar, boosting confidence in the global economic
recovery and lifting the demand outlook for raw materials.  
 Three-month delivery copper jumped as much as 4.6 percent
to $6,729.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
biggest gain since May 18. The contract traded at $6,695 at
2:54 p.m. in Shanghai. Zinc increased as much as 5.3 percent to
$1,821.75 a ton before trading at $1,808.75.  
 The dollar weakened against most of its major counterparts
and reached a four-week low versus the euro after the People’s
Bank of China two days ago indicated it’s abandoning the 6.83
yuan peg to the dollar. Industrial metals, priced in the dollar,
usually move counter to the currency. The decision was made
after the world’s third-largest economy improved, the central
bank said, one week before a Group of 20 summit.  
 “London metal prices rose on heightened expectations of a
stronger yuan,”  Zhao Kai , an analyst at Jinrui Futures Co.,
said from Shenzhen today. The yuan move may lead to stronger
London prices as compared to Shanghai in the short term,
another Jinrui analyst Zhao Xiaorui said.  
 Copper entered a bear market in London earlier this month,
plunging more than 20 percent from an April peak on concern
that the global economic recovery may be at risk. The metal
slumped as low as $6,037.50 on June 7, the lowest price in
eight months. Shanghai copper fell 18 percent from this year’s
high of 63,720 yuan ($9,353) in April.  
 China’s central bank ruled out a one-time revaluation,
saying there is no basis for “large-scale appreciation,” and
kept the yuan’s 0.5 percent daily trading band unchanged.  
 Shanghai Copper  
 Copper for September delivery in Shanghai jumped by the
daily 5 percent limit to 53,920 yuan a ton and closed at 53,700
yuan. Shanghai zinc also climbed 5 percent to 14,845 yuan and
aluminum added 3.2 percent to 15,005 yuan.  
 “Yuan appreciation may increase expectations for more
copper imports in the short term, which is bullish for London
prices but bearish for Shanghai,” Li Ye, an analyst at
Minmetals Star Futures Co., said from Shenzhen.  
 Copper imports by China, the largest consumer, declined
for a second month in May as seasonal demand lagged behind
expectations, boosting stockpiles.  
 Inbound shipments  of refined copper were 279,690 tons last
month, the Beijing-based customs office said today. That’s 9.7
percent below the amount in April and 17.1 percent less than a
year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.  
 Aluminum in London rose 3.4 percent to $2,011 a ton, lead
advanced 3.4 percent to $1,805 a ton, nickel climbed 3.1
percent to $20,200 a ton, and tin jumped 4.6 percent to $18,250
a ton.
