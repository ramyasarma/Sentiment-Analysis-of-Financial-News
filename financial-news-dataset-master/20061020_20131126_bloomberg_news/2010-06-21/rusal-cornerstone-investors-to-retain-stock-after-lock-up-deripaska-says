             United Co. Rusal’s so-called
cornerstone investors will probably hold shares after the lock-
up period even as the stock plunged 30 percent since it started
trading in January, the Russian billionaire chief executive
officer of the world’s largest aluminum company said.  
 “I think they will hold,”  Oleg Deripaska  said in an
interview in St. Petersburg June 19. Deripaska said he wasn’t
aware that key investors were thinking of selling Rusal shares.  
 New York hedge-fund manager Paulson & Co., Hong Kong
billionaire  Li Ka-Shing , Malaysian tycoon  Robert Kuok  and
 Nathaniel Rothschild  backed Rusal’s $2.24 billion initial public
offering in Hong Kong as so-called cornerstones. They are
guaranteed shares in return for a pledge not to sell them for
six months after Rusal starts trading. Vnesheconombank, Russia’s
state-lender, took 30 percent of the offering.
