             Sovereign wealth funds from China,
Singapore and South Korea and two private-equity firms agreed to
invest $900 million in  Chesapeake Energy Corp. , the third-
largest natural-gas producer in the U.S.  
 The investors bought the Oklahoma City-based gas company’s
5.75 percent convertible preferred stock on June 18, Chesapeake
said yesterday in a statement, without giving details of the
individual stakes. South Korea’s  $30 billion sovereign wealth 
fund said yesterday it will spend $200 million.  
 Asian sovereign funds are seeking to diversify after losing
money on bank stakes as stocks tumbled through the financial
crisis. The funds are buying into a company that’s among owners
of rights to U.S. shale-gas reserves in deposits including the
Marcellus shale in New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, an
area the Department of Energy estimates may contain enough to
supply America’s needs for more than a decade.  
 “Given that global financial markets have been volatile in
recent years, it seems prudent to diversify their asset base,”
said  David Cohen , an economist at Action Economics in Singapore.
“Emerging economies have accumulated substantial international
reserves in recent years and are looking for a way to diversify
their holdings.”  
 Sovereign wealth funds around the world lost money on
stocks and financial assets in 2008 as the  MSCI World Index 
plunged 42 percent. Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s state
investment company, reported profit fell a record 66 percent in
the 12 months to March 31, 2009, as a collapse in credit markets
drove down the value of its stakes in Bank of America Corp. and
Barclays Plc.  
 Shale Gas  
 “Temasek invested alongside other investors,” according
to an e-mailed statement from the company today. The statement
didn’t reveal the amount. Temasek, which bought $500 million of
convertible preferred shares of Chesapeake in May, exercised its
option to place the additional preferred stock with investors in
Asia. The sale of the additional preferred stock was closed on
June 18, according to Chesapeake’s statement.  
 Chesapeake said each share of preferred stock will be
convertible at any time at $27 a share. The  stock  dropped 0.5
percent to close at $24.49 yesterday, bringing its decline this
year to 5.4 percent. Hopu Investment Management Co. and the Li
Ka Shing Foundation in Canada are the private firms taking
stakes.  
 Chesapeake has profited by selling drilling rights and gas
reserves for $10.7 billion during the past 2 1/2 years,
quadruple the $2.7 billion it paid for the assets. The gas
producer is accelerating output of crude oil and natural-gas
liquids while scaling back gas drilling in some areas, Chief
Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon  said in February.  
 Rising Prices  
 The company is finding higher-quality fuel at its U.S.
shale-gas projects, making developing the prospects more
attractive, it said in March. Shale-gas production is changing
U.S. demand for gas as power generators switch away from coal to
the cleaner-burning fuel, Senior Vice President  Mike Stice  said
in a March 3 interview. Shale gas comes from layers of
sedimentary rock difficult to tap with conventional technology.  
 State-run Chinese companies spent a record $32 billion last
year acquiring resources overseas while South Korea, Asia’s
fourth-largest oil importer, spent $5.18 billion to develop and
buy energy assets.  
 Natural-gas prices will rise as demand for the cleaner-
burning fuel increases in the long term and as increased
regulation and costs following the BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico reduce deepwater drilling, according to Korea
Investment Corp.  
 Chesapeake will redeem $600 million of higher-priced debt
for cash, the company said yesterday in a separate statement. It
will buy back 6.375 percent of senior notes due in 2015 for
$1,031.88 for each $1,000 of principal. The gas producer sold
$1.7 billion of convertible preferred stock on May 18, saying it
would use the proceeds to repay senior debt.
