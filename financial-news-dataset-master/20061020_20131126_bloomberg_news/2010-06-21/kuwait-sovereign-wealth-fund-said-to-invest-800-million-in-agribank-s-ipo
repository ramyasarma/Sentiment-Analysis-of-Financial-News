             The Kuwait Investment Authority, the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, will invest $800 million in
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s initial public offering, a
person familiar with the transaction said.  
 The fund had offered as much as $1 billion, a figure that
was reduced to $800 million, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the talks are private.  
 The Qatar Investment Authority also agreed to invest $2.8
billion in Agricultural Bank, China’s largest lender by number
of customers, two people with knowledge of the matter said
yesterday. The Chinese lender has allocated more than $5 billion
for corporate investors such as QIA in the Hong Kong part of its
IPO, the people said.  
 Agricultural Bank is seeking to raise as much as $15
billion in Hong Kong as part of what may be the world’s largest
IPO, according to an e-mail sent to investors last week. The
Beijing-based lender may sell as much as $28 billion of stock in
Hong Kong and Shanghai combined, exceeding the $22 billion sale
by Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. in 2006.  
 Reuters reported the Kuwaiti fund’s talks earlier today.
