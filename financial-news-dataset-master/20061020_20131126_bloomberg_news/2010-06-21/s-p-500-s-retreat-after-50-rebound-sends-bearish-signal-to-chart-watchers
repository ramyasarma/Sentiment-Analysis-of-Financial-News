             Traders who base day-to-day
decisions about whether to buy stocks on chart patterns say
yesterday’s decline in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  may
signal additional losses this week.  
 The benchmark index for  U.S. equities  rose to 1,131.23
before reversing and falling to 1,113.20 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The rally fizzled above 1,120.84, the level marking a 50 percent
recovery of its October 2007 to March 2009 plunge, and 1,130.29,
the midpoint of its intraday highs and lows in 2010.  
 “We don’t expect a major plunge, nor a break of the recent
lows on the S&P 500 near 1,040, but after the strength of the
past two weeks, some short-term weakness could happen,” said
 Ryan Detrick , chief technical strategist at Schaeffer’s
Investment Research in Cincinnati. The index’s failure to hold
gains may signal “more downside pressure,” he added.  
 Shares have been influenced by  price patterns  this month as
traders await the start of the second-quarter earnings season in
July. While daily swings pushed the VIX, the benchmark measure
of U.S.  volatility  expectations, almost 50 percent above its
average level in the past 20 years, the S&P 500 completed its
biggest two-week rally since November on June 18 after reports
showed the economy is growing and Europe’s efforts to contain
its debt crisis bolstered confidence.  
 GDP Expansion  
 The stock index lost 1.6 percent to 1,095.31 at 4 p.m. in
New York today as a drop in U.S. home sales underscored concern
the recent advance in equities may have overshot prospects for
the economy.  
 Forecasts for the fastest expansion in U.S. gross domestic
product since 2004 and the biggest jump in company earnings in
more than a decade have pushed the S&P 500 up 62 percent since
March 2009. The index is trading for 13.5 times estimates for
2010 profits, compared with an average multiple of 16.4 since
1954 using reported results, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  
 The gauge has gained 4.3 percent since June 7, paring its
loss since reaching a 19-month high on April 23 to 10 percent.
It climbed 2.4 percent on June 15 as investors focused on a
level calculated from the index’s value over the last 200 days
and is little changed in the four sessions since.  
 “It is an interesting zone,” said  Stephen Suttmeier , a
vice president in U.S. technical and market analysis at Bank of
America Corp. in New York. “Our main view is that if the S&P
doesn’t take out 1,150, the bears remain in control.”  
 Economy, Profits  
 The U.S. economy may grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 2010,
according to the median estimate of 67 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Profit  among S&P 500 companies is poised to increase
18 percent this year and in 2011, estimates from more than 1,500
equity analysts compiled by Bloomberg show.  
 The  S&P 500  fell 0.4 percent as of 4 p.m. in New York
yesterday after jumping as much as 1.2 percent in the first
hour. Losses in retailers and computer makers spread to the rest
of the market as the 50 percent recovery failed to hold.  
 The 1,150 level represents “key resistance” for the index
because it’s about where a rally ended on Jan. 19 and marks a
61.8 percent retracement of the decline from April 26 to May 26,
Suttmeier said.  
 Technical analysts who use the Fibonacci ratios described
by Leonardo of Pisa in “Liber Abaci” in 1202 believe the price
of an asset may reverse an earlier gain or decline after
reaching certain levels. Among those thresholds are the midpoint
between an asset’s high and low points as well as levels marking
the recovery of 61.8 percent, 38.2 percent and 23.6 percent of
reversals of the previous trend.  
 Loss Retracements  
 The S&P 500 failed this year to achieve a 61.8 percent
retracement of the bear market between Oct. 9, 2007, and March
9, 2009. It closed at 1,217.28 on April 23, its highest level of
the year, missing that Fibonacci level by 0.7 percent.  
 The S&P 500’s 50-day  average  is another challenge facing
stock bulls, Suttmeier said. Currently at 1,135.50, the index’s
average over the past 50 trading days may be a point at which
investors decide to sell, stopping the rally, he said.  
 “Traders are moving the market right now, that’s why
technical levels matter,” said  Marc Pado , the San Francisco-
based U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP. “When you
retrace a move 50 percent, it’s a resistance point. It’s one
technical tool. What I like to see is several of them converge
to create an opportunity. To say the market will fall further
based on one level is too myopic for me.”
