             U.S. Representative  Barney Frank ,
the leader of talks to produce a final regulatory overhaul bill,
will seek to maintain the Senate’s proposed cap on debit-card
“swipe” fees with some changes, according Frank’s office.  
 The proposal by U.S. Senator  Richard Durbin  would empower
the Federal Reserve to set  interchange  fees that are
“reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing debit
transactions. His plan also would let  retailers  offer discounts
based on payment method or network, and set minimums and
maximums for credit-card purchases.  
 The House would exempt government-issued prepaid cards and
reloadable prepaid cards and allow the Fed to consider the costs
of combating fraud in determining interchange, or swipe fees,
according to the text of the House proposal. A bipartisan
committee is scheduled to debate the proposed changes tomorrow.  
 “We were able to reach an agreement which makes minor
changes to strengthen consumer protections and bring competition
to a market where there is none,” Durbin said in a statement.
“We’ve addressed the concerns of states regarding their ability
to provide services to the unemployed and the concerns of small
financial firms regarding their ability to provide services to
the unbanked.”  
 Interchange fees are set by  Visa Inc.  and  MasterCard Inc. ,
which pass the money to card-issuing banks including  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. ,  Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc.  The fees
U.S. merchants paid last year to accept Visa and MasterCard
debit cards totaled $19.7 billion and averaged 1.63 percent of
each sale, according to the Nilson Report, an industry
newsletter.  
 Mastercard, based in Purchase, New York, rose 4.4 percent
in New York trading to $223.60 as of 1:41 p.m. San Francisco-
based Visa advanced 4.5 percent to $80.53.
