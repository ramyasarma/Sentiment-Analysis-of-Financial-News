             The end of the yuan’s peg to the
greenback will be bearish for Treasuries as it boosts confidence
in a global economic recovery and signals China will slow
purchases of U.S. dollars for reserves, Morgan Stanley said.  
 Longer-maturity bonds led Treasury declines after the
People’s Bank of China two days ago indicated it’s abandoning
the 6.83 yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global
financial crisis to shield exporters. The decision was made
after the world’s third-largest economy improved, the central
bank said in a statement on its website.  
 “The more immediate bearish impact on Treasuries may stem
from the positive impact that this revaluation has on risky
assets,” analysts including  James Caron , global head of
interest-rate strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York, wrote in a
note to clients dated June 20. In the long-term, “China would
have marginally less dollars to recycle into U.S. Treasuries.”  
 The yield on the 10-year note rose six basis points, the
biggest increase in more than a week, to 3.28 percent as of 1:01
p.m. in Tokyo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 3.5
percent security due May 2020 dropped 16/32, or $5 per $1,000
face amount, to 101 27/32.  
 The U.S. dollar dropped against 14 of its 16 most traded
counterparts as the MSCI Asia Pacific  index  climbed 2.5 percent.
