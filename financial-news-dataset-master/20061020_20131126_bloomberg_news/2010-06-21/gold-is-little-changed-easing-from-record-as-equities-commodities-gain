             Gold fell the most in a month,
dropping from an all-time high as a strengthening dollar reduced
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  
 China, the world’s third-largest economy, ended a two-year
peg of its currency to the dollar, a move that may help tame
inflation. The dollar strengthened against a basket of six major
currencies, and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw
materials rose 1.6 percent before retreating. Gold set a record
$1,266.50 an ounce, surpassing Friday’s all-time high.  
 “By now allowing their currency to rise, it’s going to
help the economies of the world,” said  Leonard Kaplan , the
president of Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Illinois.
“The dollar should be screaming higher.”  
 Gold futures for delivery in August fell $17.60, or 1.4
percent, to $1,240.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest decline for a most-active contract since May 19. The
price has climbed 13 percent this year.  
 Gold historically has moved inversely to the dollar. This
year, the metal has also climbed to records in euros, sterling
and Swiss francs as Europe’s fiscal woes spurred demand for a
haven.  
 “People are going to be quick to pull the sell trigger
because gold can’t put together a rally after reaching a
record,” said  Matt Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures
Group in Chicago. “We also have stronger dollar to put
commodities in the red.”  
 Silver futures for July delivery fell 37.6 cents, or 2
percent, to $18.808 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery gained $3.30, or 0.2
percent, to $1,590.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery climbed $3.20, or
0.7 percent, to $494.10 an ounce.
