             Medco Health Solutions Inc.  and
 Celesio AG  agreed to combine operations in Europe to expand into
new markets and cut health-care costs.  
 Medco, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, and
Celesio of Germany, Europe’s biggest publicly traded drug
wholesaler, will pool operations into a 50-50 joint venture
called Medco Celesio BV and based in Amsterdam, the companies
said in a joint statement today.  
 The 50-50 joint venture is “designed to help patients with
chronic or complex conditions,” the companies said. It will
start operating in Germany this year and eventually extend to as
many as 29 European countries, the statement said.
