             The rally in FTSE 100 Index futures
expiring in September, which have risen for eight of the past
nine days, may stall as the contract reaches a resistance level
around 5,297, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  
 The September contract for the benchmark U.K. equity index
rose 60, or 1.2 percent, to 5,276 as of 12:25 p.m. in London.
That’s within 1 percent of the 5,297 level which represents a 50
percent retracement of the 16 percent decline from this year’s
intraday high on April 16 to the low reached on May 25.  
 “This is still expected to be a tough barrier to the
short-term recovery effort,” said  David Sneddon , the head of
technical analysis for Credit Suisse in London. “We look for
the advance to at least initially stall here.”  
 Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines. The
trading patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  
 Sneddon forecast May 17 that the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index would swing within a range of 9.3 percent during the next
few weeks. The gauge fell 7.6 percent from then through June 7
and has since risen 6.4 percent.
