             A 20 percent increase in deepwater
drilling costs for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico would have a minimal
effect on global oil and gas prices, according to the former
chief energy economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.  
 The costs from regulatory safeguards that may be imposed in
the wake of the  BP Plc  oil spill would add about 18 cents a
barrel to oil prices in 2011 and 28 cents in 2035, or about 0.5
cent and 0.8 cent per gallon of gasoline, said  Stephen P.A. Brown , an Arlington, Texas-based non-resident fellow at
Resources for the Future, a nonprofit energy research firm.  
 “The estimated effect of 20 percent higher costs for U.S.
deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling on the world oil price is
relatively slight because the change in U.S. offshore-production
is very small when seen in the context of the world oil
market,” he said in a report published today.  
 Brown, the former director of energy economics at the
Dallas Fed, which covers the Gulf Coast region, said this
scenario would cause U.S. consumption to drop slightly and
imports to increase.  
 The increase in the cost of drilling would also have a
minimal effect on natural-gas prices, raising the price of the
fuel at Henry Hub by about 1.3 cents per million British thermal
units in 2011 and 2.8 cents per million Btu in 2035, Brown said.  
 A six-month moratorium on U.S. deepwater drilling announced
by President  Barack Obama  last month will trim about 70,000
barrels a day from estimated 2011 oil production, according to
the Energy Department.  
 The Energy Department lowered its 2010 forecast for Gulf
production at federal leases to 1.69 million barrels a day in
its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  from 1.8 million estimated
in May. The overall forecast for domestic production dropped by
2.2 percent to 5.39 million barrels a day.
