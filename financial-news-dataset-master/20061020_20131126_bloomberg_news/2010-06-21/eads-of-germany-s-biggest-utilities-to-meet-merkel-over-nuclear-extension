             Chief executive officers of
Germany’s four largest utilities will meet Chancellor  Angela Merkel  on June 23 to discuss extending the running time of
nuclear power plants, a government spokesman said.  
 Merkel plans to present a national energy strategy by late
August that may lay out steps for overturning a former
government’s phase-out of nuclear power by about 2020. In the
meantime, she’s seeking to tax nuclear power to trim Germany’s
budget deficit.  
 The extension of nuclear plants’ running time is on the
agenda for Merkel’s talks with the heads of  E.ON AG ,  RWE AG ,
 EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG  and  Vattenfall AB  at the
chancellery in Berlin, government spokesman  Christoph Steegmans 
told reporters today. “Decisions won’t be made,” he said.  
 German utilities are waiting for a reprieve to run reactors
past shutdown dates that would close plants ahead of
international peers and boost spending on power capacity.  
 Merkel, who says she supports an extended role for atomic
power as a “bridge technology,” announced the planned levy on
the nuclear industry on June 7 as part of an austerity budget
that aims to thwart a sovereign-debt crisis. The two matters
aren’t linked, according to the Finance Ministry.
