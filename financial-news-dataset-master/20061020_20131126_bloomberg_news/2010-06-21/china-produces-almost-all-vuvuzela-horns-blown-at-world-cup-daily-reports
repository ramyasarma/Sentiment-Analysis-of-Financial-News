             China produced almost all the
vuvuzela horns being blown during this year’s World Cup soccer
matches, with the nation’s manufacturers accounting for up to 90
percent of the horns in South Africa, the China Daily reported
today, citing producers.  
 Jiying Plastic Products in eastern China’s Zhejiang
province has sold more than 1 million of the horns since April,
the Beijing-based English-language newspaper reported, citing
general manager Wu Yijun. Almost all the horns came from five
factories in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, the
newspaper reported, citing Wu.
