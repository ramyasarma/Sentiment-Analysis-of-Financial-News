             Government bond price declines
should be seen as an opportunity to buy the securities because
market jitters over a potential weakening of economic growth
will maintain demand, Nomura International Plc said.  
 “We expect sensitivity to be high to any further signs of
slowing, and at the very least, this is likely to cause extra
volatility,” a team of Nomura analysts led by Nick Firoozye in
London said today in an investor report. “This means that bonds
will remain in favor. Dips are ultimately still buying
opportunities.”  
 The benchmark 10-year German bund yield rise two basis
points to 2.76 percent as of 9:29 a.m. in London.
