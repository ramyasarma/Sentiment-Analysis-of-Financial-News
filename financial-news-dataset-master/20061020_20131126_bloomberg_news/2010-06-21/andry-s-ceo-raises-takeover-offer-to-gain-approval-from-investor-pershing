             Landry’s Restaurants Inc.  Chief
Executive Officer  Tilman Fertitta  raised his bid for the seafood
chain to $24.50 a share to gain approval from shareholder
Pershing Square Capital Management.  
 The increase, which brings the total value of the
transaction to about $1.4 billion, is Fertitta’s third since his
initial offer in November. The latest bid is 2.1 percent more
than the $24 he offered in May, Landry’s said in a statement.  
 Landry’s operates restaurants such as the Rainforest Café,
Chart House and Landry’s Seafood House. The chain posted  sales 
growth in the first quarter after six periods of decline.  
 Fertitta, who founded the chain, owns about 55 percent of
the  shares  outstanding. Pershing Square, based in New York, owns
about 9.9 percent of Landry’s outstanding common stock,
according to the statement.  
 Landry’s, based in Houston, increased 39 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $24.33 at 10:06 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite  trading . The shares had gained 12 percent this year
before today.  
 Bill Ackman , who runs New York-based Pershing Square,
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. The Wall
Street Journal reported the move earlier today.
