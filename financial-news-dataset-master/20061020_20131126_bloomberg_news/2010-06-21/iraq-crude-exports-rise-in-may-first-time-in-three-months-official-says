             Iraq, holder of the world’s third-
largest oil reserves, exported 9.7 percent more crude in May
than in April, the first increase in three months, an oil
ministry official said.  
 Daily shipments rose to about 1.89 million barrels a day,
or 58.7 million barrels in total,  Asim Jihad , a spokesman for
the oil ministry, said in an e-mailed statement today. That
compares with April shipments of 1.77 million barrels a day, or
53 million for the month,  according to the ministry’s Web site .  
 Dependent on oil for most government revenue, Iraq is
seeking foreign investors to boost output after seven years of
conflict and prior sanctions destroyed its infrastructure. The
nation awarded 10 contracts to international companies in two
oil licensing rounds last year, and announced a third bidding
this year.  
 Revenue from oil exports in May rose to $4.34 billion as
Iraq sold crude at an average price of $73.85 a barrel, Jihad
said. April income stood at $4.2 billion at an average $79.66 a
barrel, he said last month.  
 Most of the exports were through the southern port of
Basrah, totaling about 45.1 million barrels, bringing in $3.35
billion, Jihad said. About 13.6 million barrels were exported
from Kirkuk in the north, providing $988 million, he said.  
 The decline in crude exports in the three previous months
was mainly due to bad weather and attacks on infrastructure by
insurgents, Oil Minister  Hussain Al-Shahristani  said May 17.  
 Total Iraqi production is about 2.4 million barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Crude oil export revenue accounted for 86 percent of
government revenue in 2008, according to the International
Monetary Fund.
