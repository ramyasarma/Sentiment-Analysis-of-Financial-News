             The number of British soldiers
killed in the nine-year-old war against the Taliban in
Afghanistan reached 300, a level that may increase calls for
Prime Minister  David Cameron  to set a deadline for withdrawal.  
 A member of the Royal Marines died in a hospital in
Birmingham, central England, yesterday after he was injured in
an explosion in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan on June
12, the defense ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  
 “This is a milestone and puts Cameron under pressure,”
 Mark Wickham-Jones , professor of politics at Bristol University,
said in a telephone interview. “He wants to leave Afghanistan
in good shape so it doesn’t immediately fall into the hands of
the Taliban, and he wants to preserve the fragile Anglo-U.S.
alliance, but he also needs to satisfy popular pressure at home
to define the exit strategy.”  
 The U.K. is the second-largest contributor to the  NATO -led
force in Afghanistan after the U.S., with 9,500 soldiers, mainly
in Helmand, as well as an unspecified number of special forces.
More British service personnel have died in Afghanistan than in
any conflict since the  Troubles  in Northern Ireland, which
lasted for 30 years from the late 1960s, and in which 651
soldiers were killed.  
 ‘High Price’  
 “We are paying a high price for keeping our country safe,
for making our world a safer place and we should keep asking why
we are there and how long we must be there,” Cameron told
reporters today. “We are there because the Afghans are not yet
ready to keep their own country safe and to keep terrorists and
terrorist training camps out of their country.”  
 He described the latest death as “desperately sad news.”  
 When Cameron last visited British troops in southern
Afghanistan on June 11, he told them they are fighting a “war
of necessity” and will go home as soon as Afghans are ready to
secure their own country.  
 In recent weeks the NATO-led coalition has pushed into the
Taliban heartland of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan. Efforts
to train enough Afghan troops and police are aimed at allowing
the allies to begin withdrawing forces in July 2011.  
 A  poll  by YouGov Plc last week found 25 percent of those
questioned want all troops to be withdrawn immediately, with
another 42 percent saying most soldiers should be pulled out
soon and the rest within the next year or so. YouGov questioned
1,435 British adults for The Sun newspaper on June 13-14. No
margin of error was given.
