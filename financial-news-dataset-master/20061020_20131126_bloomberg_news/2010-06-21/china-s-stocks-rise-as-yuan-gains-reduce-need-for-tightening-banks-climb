             China’s stocks rose, led by banks,
airlines and property companies on the prospect that yuan
appreciation will help tame inflation, reducing the need for
interest-rate increases.  
 The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.8 percent to
2,532.88 at 10:04 a.m. local time. The measure had declined as
much as 0.4 percent earlier on concern a stronger yuan will hurt
exporters.
