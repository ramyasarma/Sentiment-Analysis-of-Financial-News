             CEZ AS , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, is demanding the right to select its own fuel
suppliers during talks with three bidders to expand its Temelin
nuclear power plant.  
 Areva SA , Westinghouse Electric Co. LLC and ZAO
Atomstroyexport must submit bids that don’t limit CEZ’s fuel
sources,  Petr Zavodsky , the company’s director of construction,
said in a Prague interview. Westinghouse, which upgraded the
Soviet-designed Temelin plant to Western standards in the 1990s,
lost its exclusive fuel supply contract when CEZ switched to
Russia’s OAO TVEL beginning this year.  
 “Our project stipulates that we want to be free to choose
the fuel supplier,” Zavodsky said at an interview in his office
on June 17. “There are several nuclear fuel producers, and we
want to keep the possibility to change suppliers if necessary.”  
 The Czech Republic and other former communist-bloc nations
are expanding nuclear energy programs to replace diminishing
coal supplies and lower carbon dioxide emissions without
increasing reliance on Russian gas. CEZ may spend between $6
billion and $9 billion to double its reactors at Temelin, Cyrrus
analyst  Marek Hatlapatka  said in an e-mailed message.  
 The company plans to load the first batch of the Russian
fuel into the first Temelin reactor during the planned summer
shutdown, Zavodsky said.  
 CEZ will also ask the bidders to include enough technical
detail to allow CEZ to make its own modifications and
maintenance of the new reactors without having to turn to the
builder every time it needs to make adjustments or repairs, the
executive said.  
 Officials of the three bidders visited the Temelin plant
this spring and are holding consultation meetings this month
with CEZ, which wants to begin construction in 2012.
