             Komatsu Ltd.  and  Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co.  rose in Tokyo trading on optimism
they will benefit from a stronger yuan after China signaled an
end to the currency’s fixed rate against the dollar.  
 Komatsu  shares  gained 3.9 percent to 1,770 yen at the 11
a.m. trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after advancing
as much as 5.1 percent, the largest advance since Jan. 12.
Hitachi Construction Machinery  surged  5.8 percent to 1,857 yen,
the biggest increase since Feb. 2.  
 China overtook Japan as the largest market for Komatsu,
accounting for 19 percent of the Tokyo-based company’s total
sales last fiscal year. A stronger yuan would cut import costs
for components built in Japan, boosting earnings at Komatsu and
its largest domestic rival Hitachi Construction. The two
companies are Asia’s largest excavator makers.  
 The news is “positive for Japanese construction machinery
makers, as they expand sales in the market,”  Hiroyuki Soma , an
analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. He rates
Komatsu and Hitachi Construction Machinery “neutral plus.”  
 Hitachi Construction Machinery got 26 percent of sales from
China for the year ended March 31, according to an April 26
 presentation  by the company. China is Hitachi’s the largest
overseas market.
