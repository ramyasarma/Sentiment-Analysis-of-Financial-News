             President  Dmitry Medvedev  will seek
a “definitive” answer from  Barack Obama  about the U.S. stance
on Russia’s bid to enter the World Trade Organization when the
two leaders meet this week in Washington, an aide said.  
 “We count on getting a more definitive response” and an
“understanding of what they see as the hurdles,”  Sergei Prikhodko , Medvedev’s foreign policy aide, told reporters late
yesterday in Moscow. “It is awkward to keep knocking when the
door should be open and we should be welcomed with open arms.”  
 Russia, the largest economy outside the Geneva-based WTO,
has been working to join for almost two decades. Russia has sent
contradictory signals about whether it wants to enter the WTO
alone or, as Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  announced last June,
as part of a customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus.  
 Medvedev arrives in California late tonight at the start of
a three-day U.S. visit that will involve visits to technology
companies, including San Francisco-based Twitter Inc. and San
Jose-based  Cisco Systems Inc. , as well as talks with Obama on
June 24 in Washington.  
 The U.S. strongly supports Russia’s bid to join the WTO,
though work remains to be done,  Robert Hormats ,  undersecretary
of state for economics, energy and agriculture, said June 17 at
the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  
 “We think that to a great degree the pace of completing
the entry talks depends on the U.S.,” Prikhodko said, adding
that he hopes pledges of assistance from U.S. leaders “will
materialize into concrete negotiating positions.”  
 Broad Agenda  
 Obama and Medvedev will have a wide-ranging agenda for
their meeting, including ratification of the nuclear arms
reduction treaty they signed in April, missile defense, European
security and Russia’s relations with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Prikhodko said.  
 The two administrations are also working on a joint
statement on Kyrgyzstan “to demonstrate our common concern with
the events there and readiness to offer support,” he said.  
 Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic bordering China,
descended into unrest in April when President Kurmanbek Bakiyev
was ousted and replaced by an interim government led by  Rosa Otunbayeva . The city of Osh had been at the center of violence
that has left hundreds dead and displaced about 300,000 in the
south of the country.  
 The U.S. and Russia have jostled for influence in
Kyrgyzstan, where both countries have air bases. The U.S. relies
on the Manas base outside the capital Bishkek to support
operations in Afghanistan after Uzbekistan evicted the American
military in 2005.  
 Prikhodko said there will be no mention of the base in the
joint statement.  
 Business Deals  
 After their summit, Medvedev and Obama will meet with
business leaders from both countries and oversee the signing of
some deals.  
 The Russian business delegation will include Russian
Technologies Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Sergei Chemezov , OAO
Novolipetsk Steel’s billionaire owner  Vladimir Lisin ,
billionaire Roustam Tariko, owner of Russian Standard vodka, and
 Mikhail Prokhorov , owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team.  
 The U.S. delegation will include  Jim Albaugh , CEO of Boeing
Co.’s commercial aircraft division. Russia expects Chicago-based
Boeing to sign an agreement to sell its 737 aircraft to Russian
Technologies, Prikhodko said.  Boeing  may also agree to expand
cooperation with OAO VSMPO-Avisma, the world’s biggest titanium
producer.  
 The two leaders will also discuss Medvedev’s proposal to
co-develop a heavy-lift cargo plane, an idea he raised during
Obama’s visit to Moscow last July, Prikhodko said.  
 “Boeing is carrying out an internal audit” of the
proposal, he said.  
 Possible Partnerships  
 Dmitry Krol, Boeing’s spokesman in Moscow, said he couldn’t
comment specifically on the proposal.  
 “We can say we regularly look at opportunities to partner
with industry around the world,” Krol said in an e-mailed
response to questions. “Those partnerships, when they
materialize, can take a variety of forms.”  
 Russia needs funding and customers to resume production of
the Soviet-designed Antonov-124, which carries outsized cargo
for everyone from the military to pop stars.  
 The project could become “the largest cooperation effort
between the two countries since the International Space
Station,”  Alexei Fyodorov , CEO of Moscow-based United Aircraft
Corp., said in a June 16 interview. The aircraft could be
assembled at Boeing’s Long Beach, California, plant for C-17
military transport planes.  
 “We, the U.S., are giving this proposal a careful and
extensive review of its merits,” Kevin Kabumoto, a spokesman
for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said by phone. “In the final
analysis, this is a business decision to be made by the private
sector partners involved.”
