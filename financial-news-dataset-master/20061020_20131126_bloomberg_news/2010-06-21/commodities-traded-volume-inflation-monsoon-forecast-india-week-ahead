             India’s commodity markets regulator
may today report an increase in turnover at the nation’s bourses,
while the federal government this week may say  food inflation 
slowed on higher supplies of grains.  
 Traded volume on commodity exchanges in India rose 72
percent to 4.03 trillion rupees ($87.3 billion) in the two weeks
ended May 31, from 2.34 trillion rupees a year earlier, the
Forward Markets Commission said on June 8.  
 India’s food inflation in the week to June 5 slowed.
Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said prospects of sufficient
rains this year will boost harvests, driving prices even lower.
The rate has stayed above 15 percent since November as last
year’s showers were the least in India since 1972. The data for
the seven days ended June 12 are due June 24.  
 An  index  measuring wholesale prices of agriculture products
including lentils, rice and vegetables compiled by the commerce
ministry rose 16.12 percent from a year earlier, according to
the latest figures released in New Delhi on June 17. It gained
16.74 percent the previous week.  
 India’s met dept may revise its forecast for rainfall for
the June-September monsoon season on June 25. The weather office
may also announce details about rainfall expected in July and
August.  
 Stocks, Rupee  
 The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
rose 3 percent in the five days to June 18, its biggest weekly
advance in more than three months.  
 The rupee completed its best week since January on
speculation the central bank will raise borrowing costs a third
time this year to curb inflation, making local assets more
attractive to investors seeking higher yields. The currency
gained 1.4 percent last week to 46.1750 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  
 Benchmark 10-year bonds completed their best week in a
month on speculation demand will improve as the government buys
back debt, injecting cash into the financial system. The yield
on the 7.8 percent note due May 2020 dropped five basis points
to 7.56 percent last week.
