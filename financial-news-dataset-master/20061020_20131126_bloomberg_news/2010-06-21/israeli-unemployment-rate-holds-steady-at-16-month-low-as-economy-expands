             Israel’s  unemployment rate  held at a
16-month low in April as the economy expanded.  
 The jobless rate was 6.9 percent, the same as in the
previous month, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics
said today on its website. Unemployment peaked at 7.9 percent in
May and June of 2009.  
 “There is strong domestic demand, and high tech exports
continue to be strong,”  Ron Eichel , chief economist at Tel
Aviv-based Meitav Securities & Investment Ltd., said in a
telephone interview today prior to the release.  
 Israel’s economy expanded an annualized 3.6 percent in the
first quarter, led by exports. Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said on June 18 that the bank expects economic growth of
3.7 percent this year. Unemployment is likely to drop to an
average of 7 percent from 7.7 percent in 2009, according to the
bank’s forecast. In 2011, unemployment is likely to decline to
an average of 6.7 percent, the bank said.  
 Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 stock index  surged about 35
percent in the past 12 months, led by Perrigo Co., the world’s
largest maker of non-prescription, store-branded drugs, which
more than doubled.
