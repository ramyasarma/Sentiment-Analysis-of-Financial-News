             House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi  said her
chamber won’t pass a Senate bill to halt a cut in Medicare
payments to doctors until the Senate also acts on job-creation
legislation.  
 Pelosi, a California Democrat, said in a statement that the
Senate measure passed on June 18 was “inadequate” because it
didn’t address other parts of a jobs bill passed by the House on
May 29.  
 “I see no reason to pass this inadequate bill until we see
jobs legislation coming out of the Senate,” she said  
 The House measure would extend unemployment insurance,
restore some tax breaks and raise taxes on managers of buyout
funds and other investment partnerships.  
 Senate Democratic leaders repeatedly trimmed their version
of the jobs bill, which included the Medicare-payment provision,
in an unsuccessful effort to attract votes.  
 They decided to pass the measure addressing solely the
Medicare payments just as a 21 percent cut in payments to
doctors were to take effect. The bill would delay the reductions
until December.  
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said on June
18 it would begin processing claims at the lower payment rate
because the Senate bill hadn’t cleared Congress and been signed
into law.  
 Negotiations on the rest of the Senate jobs measure are to
continue this week.
