             Cotton futures rose on speculation
that China, the world’s largest consumer, will boost imports
after ending the yuan’s peg to the dollar. Orange juice declined
to a one-week low.  
 The People’s Bank of China said June 19 it will relax the
fixed rate of 6.83 yuan to the dollar because the nation’s
economic recovery “cemented” after the global financial
crisis. The country may import an additional 1 million metric
tons before the new crop enters the market in August and
September, Dong Shuzhi, an assistant manager at Jinshi Futures
Co., said last week.  
 “Demand from China will support prices,” said  Tom Mikulski , a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago.  
 Cotton for December delivery gained 0.22 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 79.17 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.7 percent. The most-
active contract has advanced 40 percent in the past 12 months,
partly because adverse weather last year reduced output in the
U.S., the largest exporter.  
 Orange-juice futures for September delivery declined 1.85
cents, or 1.3 percent, to $1.424 a pound in New York. Earlier,
the price touched $1.416, the lowest level since June 10. The
commodity has jumped 77 percent in the past year.
