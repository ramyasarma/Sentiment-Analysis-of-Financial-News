             China’s move to loosen its currency
peg may result in periods of depreciation of the yuan against
the dollar and “two-way volatility,” not just appreciation,
HSBC Holdings Plc analysts said.  
 “Some will believe this to mean a simple return to gradual
appreciation,” HSBC strategists  Daniel Hui  and Richard Yetsenga
said in an e-mailed note. “We disagree.” Volatility for non-
deliverable yuan forwards will be “structurally higher,” they
wrote.  
 Hui and Yetsenga said the renminbi may end the year lower
than their current forecast of 6.80 per dollar, and said China’s
timing of the move was “due to political concerns” given the
nation’s “trade friction” with the U.S.  
 “The shift to a genuine basket regime could prove faster
than we originally expect,” they said, referring to a policy
that would link the yuan to several currencies rather than just
the dollar.
