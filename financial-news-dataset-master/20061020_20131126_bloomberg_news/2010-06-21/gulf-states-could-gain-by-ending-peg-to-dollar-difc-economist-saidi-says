             Gulf states could gain by ending
their peg to the dollar in favor of a basket of currencies, said
the chief economist of the Dubai International Financial Centre.  
 “It would be advantageous for the GCC countries, given the
center of their trade is particularly with Asia and with Europe,
to have a currency basket,”  Nasser Saidi  told Bloomberg
Television in Abu Dhabi today.  
 He said such a move could not be easily implemented at a
time of global financial uncertainty, “so I think the countries
of the region are going to wisely wait until you have much less
volatility in money markets and financial markets before taking
any decisions with respect to the exchange rate regime.”  
 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, four of the six
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, took an initial step
toward creating a single currency on March 30 when their central
bank governors held the first meeting of the Monetary Council, a
precursor to a united central bank. Kuwait’s dinar is pegged to
a basket of currencies while the other five GCC members have a
peg to the dollar.  
 Gulf countries agreed on a single currency in 2001, saying
it would help integrate their economies, and the original
timetable would have seen the new monetary unit in place this
year. The deadline was missed after the United Arab Emirates and
Oman pulled out.  
 Saudi Arabian Central Bank Governor  Muhammad al-Jasser  said
in February that the dollar will remain pre-eminent even as it
sees competition over its global reserve status from a
“multipolar” currency system.
