             Chile beat 10-man Switzerland 1-0
for its second straight win in Group H at the World Cup.  
 Mark Gonzalez, a halftime substitute, headed in Esteban
Paredes’s cross for the winning goal after 75 minutes in Port
Elizabeth, South Africa. The Swiss had midfielder Valon Behrami
red-carded in the first half.  
 Chile is a step nearer advancing to the first knockout
stage, while Switzerland still has hopes of doing so after it
upset Spain 1-0 last week.  
 Behrami was ejected in the 31st minute for lashing out at
Arturo Vidal with his hand as they tussled for the ball.  
 Earlier, Gonzalez had a goal ruled offside after his 20-
yard shot took a deflection while three teammates were in
offside positions. Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio came off his
goal-line to save from Alexis Sanchez in the 55th minute.  
 Although Chile had most of the chances, Swiss substitute
Eren Derdiyok shot wide from eight yards with just the
goalkeeper to beat in stoppage time.  
 Earlier, Portugal beat North Korea 7-0 in Group G. Spain
faces Honduras later in today’s other game.
