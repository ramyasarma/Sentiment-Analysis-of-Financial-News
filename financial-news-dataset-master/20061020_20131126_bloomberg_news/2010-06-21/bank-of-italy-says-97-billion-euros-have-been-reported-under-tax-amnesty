             The Bank of Italy said 97 billion
euros were reported under a tax amnesty from September 2009
through April this year, according to a  statement  published
today on the central bank’s website.  
 The bank said 11.4 billion euros were reported during the
period from January to April this year, when the amnesty was
extended. The overall figure differs from a total of 104.5
billion euros reported by the Finance Ministry on June 9 because
of “differences in the coverage of the sources and in the
timing of recording,” the bank said.
