             Banco Santander SA , Spain’s biggest
bank, is trying to resurrect talks to combine its U.S. business
with  M&T Bank Corp.  after negotiations collapsed last month,
said three people with knowledge of the matter.  
 Santander and M&T recently scheduled a meeting between the
banks’ top executives, two of the people said, speaking on
condition of anonymity because the matter is private. The banks’
leaders still disagree on who would control the combined firm --
the issue that led the discussions to break down in May, the
people said.  
 Before talks fell apart, Santander had been discussing a
stock merger of its Sovereign Bank unit and M&T in which the
Spanish bank would end up with a minority stake, said one of the
people. Santander was seeking a deal that would allow it to
eventually gain control of the combined bank, a move that M&T
resisted, the person said.  
 Combining with Buffalo, New York-based M&T, whose stock
market value is about $11 billion, would add scale to Sovereign,
which had $73.4 billion of assets and $41.8 billion of deposits
as of March 31, according to data from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. M&T had $67.5 billion of assets and $47.4
billion of deposits.  
 Santander has also been considering buying Allied Irish
Banks Plc’s 22.5 percent stake in M&T, put up for sale by the
Dublin-based lender to raise capital.  
 Spokespeople for Santander, M&T and Allied Irish declined
to comment.  
 Santander, which acquired 19.8 percent of Sovereign in 2005
and gained full control last year, hasn’t made a decision about
any combination with M&T,  Matias Inciarte , a Santander vice
chairman, said in Spain last week.  
 M&T shares rose $3.87, or 4.3 percent, to $94.58 at 2:22
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after
climbing as much as 5.8 percent earlier. Santander rose 7 cents
to 9.42 euros.
