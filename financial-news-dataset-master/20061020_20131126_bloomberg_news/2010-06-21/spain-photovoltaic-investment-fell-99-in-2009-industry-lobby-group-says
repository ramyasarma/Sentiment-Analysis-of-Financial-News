             Investment in Spanish photovoltaic
power plants fell 99 percent last year after the government cut
the price solar generators earn, according to the Madrid-based
Photovoltaic Industry Association.  
 Developers invested 233 million euros ($288 million) to
build 70 megawatts of new generating capacity, down from 16.4
billion euros of investment in 2008, a spokesman for the
association said in a telephone interview.  
 Officials from the Spanish Industry Ministry are meeting
solar developers today to discuss plans for reducing the price
that existing solar generators earn. The government already cut
the price for future projects by about 23 percent in a September
2008 law after subsidies sparked an investment boom.  
 Spain’s 52,000 solar plants claimed over half the country’s
5 billion euros in renewable-power subsidies last year and
produced 11 percent of its emission-free power. Industry
Minister  Miguel Sebastian  is planning to rein in the cost of
electricity in Spain to boost the competitiveness of industry as
the government struggles to re-ignite economic growth.
