             Trading of bullish  H.J. Heinz Co. 
options surged to more than quadruple the four-week average as
investors boosted bets that the world’s biggest ketchup maker
will rally to a two-year high after saying it will buy soy-sauce
manufacturer Foodstar.  
 Traders were  most focused  on September $50 calls, which
accounted for almost nine-tenths of the 5,300 call options to
buy the stock changing hands at 11:14 a.m. New York time. The
shares fell 0.3 percent to $46.10. More than 87 calls changed
hands for each put giving the right to sell.  
 Sixty-seven percent of the September $50 calls traded at
the ask price, which indicates that buyers initiated most of the
transactions. Heinz hasn’t closed above that level since October
2008.  
 Heinz said in a statement today that it agreed to buy
Foodstar from Transpac Industrial Holdings Ltd. for $165 million
in cash to expand in China.
