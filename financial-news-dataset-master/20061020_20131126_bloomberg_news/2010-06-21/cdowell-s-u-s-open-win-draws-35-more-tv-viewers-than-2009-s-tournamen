             Graeme McDowell ’s prime-time U.S.
Open win over the world’s top-ranked golfers drew a 35 percent
increase in television ratings over a year earlier.  
 McDowell’s even-par victory at Pebble Beach Golf Links in
California, which concluded last night during prime time on the
East Coast, was seen in 6.9 percent of U.S. households in the
top 56 television markets, NBC Universal said today in a news
release, citing Nielsen Co.  
 That’s 35 percent higher than last year’s final-round
rating of 5.1, when  Lucas Glover  took home the title at Bethpage
State Park’s Black Course in Farmingdale, New York, said NBC,
which is majority owned by  General Electric Co . Each rating
point equals 1 percent of the estimated 114.9 million U.S. TV
households, according to Nielsen.  
 It’s also the best rating for a U.S. Open that wasn’t won
by  Tiger Woods  since 2001, when  Retief Goosen ’s victory at
Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma, drew a 7.0
rating.  
 McDowell, from Northern Ireland, claimed his first major
championship at the course in Pebble Beach, California, becoming
the first European to win a U.S. Open in 40 years.  
 He shot a 3-over-par 74 to finish a shot ahead of Frenchman
Gregory Havret.  Tiger Woods  and  Phil Mickelson , the top two
players in the Official World Golf Ranking, tied for fourth at
3-over.
