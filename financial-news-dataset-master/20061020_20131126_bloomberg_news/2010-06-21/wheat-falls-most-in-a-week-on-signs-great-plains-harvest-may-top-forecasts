             Wheat fell for the second straight
session on speculation that the harvest in the U.S. Great Plains
will top forecasts, after ample rain was followed by sunshine.  
 Some fields in southern Kansas have yielded 50 bushels to
60 bushels an acre, the industry group Kansas Wheat said
yesterday in report. That’s more than the 40.7 bushels forecast
last month by analysts who toured fields in the state. Wheat
prices have dropped 12 percent this year on rising global
stockpiles.  
 “The U.S. supply of wheat and the world supply are at
levels that will depress prices,” said  Tom Leffler , the owner
of Leffler Commodities LLC in Augusta, Kansas. “Yields have
been pretty good out there. We have additional yields on top of
burdensome supplies.”  
 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 0.5 cent, or 0.1
percent, to $4.7725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures gained 4.5 percent last week, partly because rain slowed
collection of the winter-wheat crop in the U.S.  
 In Kansas, the biggest U.S. producer of winter varieties,
warm, dry weather over the past three days helped farmers speed
up the harvest, the wheat group said.  
 The price also may have fallen today after Egypt, the
world’s biggest importer of wheat, on June 19 said it bought
120,000 metric tons of Russian and Kazakh grain, shunning U.S.
stockpiles.  
 Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.
