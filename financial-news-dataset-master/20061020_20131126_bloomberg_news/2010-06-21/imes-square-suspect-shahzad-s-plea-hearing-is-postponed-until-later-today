             An arraignment for Faisal Shahzad,
accused in the attempted May 1 car-bombing of New York’s Times
Square, has been delayed until 4:30 p.m. today.  
 U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum in Manhattan said
prosecutors and Shahzad’s lawyers agreed to postpone the
hearing. No reason was given. Shahzad was indicted on 10
terrorism-related charges on June 17.
