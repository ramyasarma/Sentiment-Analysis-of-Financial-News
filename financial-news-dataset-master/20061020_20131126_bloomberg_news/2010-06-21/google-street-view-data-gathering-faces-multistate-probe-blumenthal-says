             Connecticut Attorney General  Richard Blumenthal  said his office will lead a multistate investigation
into Google Inc.’s unauthorized collection of personal data from
wireless computer networks.  
 Connecticut and states including Massachusetts and Illinois
are demanding information on what Google calls the inadvertent
gathering of data from wireless networks, such as e-mail and
passwords, as it took pictures of streets and houses for its
 Street View  service. The company’s response so far “raises as
many questions as it answers,” Blumenthal said today.  
 “The company must provide a complete and comprehensive
explanation of how this unauthorized data collection happened,
why the information was kept if collection was inadvertent and
what action will prevent a recurrence,” he said.  
 Blumenthal said last week that attorneys general and their
representatives from more than 30 states discussed the company’s
actions in a conference call. He said today he expects “a
significant number of states” to participate in the
investigation.  
 “It was a mistake for us to include code in our software
that collected payload data, but we believe we did nothing
illegal,  Christine Chen , a Google spokeswoman, said today in an
e-mail. “We’re working with the relevant authorities to answer
their questions and concerns.”  
 Illinois, Massachusetts  
 The top legal officers of Illinois and Massachusetts said
June 16 they sent a letter to Mountain View, California-based
Google, the most popular search engine, asking for “detailed
information” about the practice.  
 Attorney General  Lisa Madigan  of Illinois said it is
“disturbing” that Google collected the data since 2007.  
 Blumenthal said the multistate investigation “will
consider whether laws may have been broken and whether changes
to state and federal statutes may be necessary.”  
 He said he will specifically ask what data were collected;
when, why and how it was done; and why accidentally collected
data were saved.  
 “Google needs to describe how code that intercepted and
collected unencrypted data transmitted over WiFi networks was
inserted into its software,” Blumenthal said in the statement.  
 Google fell $11.47, or 2.3 percent, to $488.56 at 4:29 p.m.
in NASDAQ Stock Market trading. The shares have risen 20 percent
in the past year.
