             HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s
third-largest cement maker, said it aims to revive profit with
spending reductions and by adding plants in emerging markets
such as India, Indonesia and Bangladesh.  
 The company remains focused on cutting borrowing costs
while completing a four-year, 20 million metric-ton expansion of
production capacity in countries such as Poland and Russia by
2012, Chief Executive Officer  Bernd Scheifele  said today in an
e-mailed response to questions.  
 “We’re concentrating on further cost savings and lowering
our  debt ,” Scheifele said. “At the same time, we want to lay
the foundation for our future growth.”  
 Scheifele widened the company’s cost-cutting target for
2010 by 50 percent to 300 million euros ($373 million) in
February after refinancing, reorganization costs and goodwill
impairments caused  profit  to plunge by 98 percent last year. The
cement producer remains committed to selling divisions that
aren’t related to its main business, the CEO said.  
 HeidelbergCement joined Germany’s  DAX Index  today,
occupying a slot vacated by steelmaker Salzgitter AG. The
Heidelberg, Germany-based cement producer became eligible for
the benchmark when the stake held by billionaire  Ludwig Merckle 
and his family fell to 24.4 percent from 72.4 percent because of
a  share sale  last year and after it met average trading-volume
and market-value criteria.  
 Job Cuts  
 The company eliminated 7,500 jobs last year, or
12 percent of the  workforce , and held the  dividend  at 12 cents a
share after net income dropped to 42.6 million euros. Net debt
 narrowed  to 8.96 billion euros as of March 31 from 12.1 billion
euros a year earlier.  
 HeidelbergCement said in December that it may dispose of
operations such as bricks and building products that don’t fit
company strategy. Any transaction will depend on how the
recovery of residential construction markets in North America
and Europe helps the divisions’ pricing, Scheifele said.  
 The company boosted borrowing in 2007 when it paid $12
billion to buy Hanson Ltd., a building-supply company. A
construction-industry slowdown and wrong-way bets on  Volkswagen
AG  shares by the Merckle family left the company struggling with
repayments.  
 HeidelbergCement  rose as much as 1.10 euros, or 2.4
percent, to 46.20 euros and was up 1.1 percent as of 11:24 a.m.
in Frankfurt trading. That pared the stock’s  decline  this year
to 5.5 percent, valuing the company at 8.55 billion euros. The
performance has trailed the 30-member  DAX ’s 5.7 percent gain.
