             Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. said it
may lose about three days of production, or an estimated 21
kilograms of output, after it shut down a shaft at its Phakisa
mine in South Africa following the death of a worker.  
 Marian van der Walt, a spokeswoman for Johannesburg-based
Harmony, made the comments in a mobile-phone interview today.
