             BP Plc fended off two key demands 
from the White House over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill 
aftermath even as it agreed to hand over $20 billion to cover 
compensation and clean-up costs, the Wall Street Journal 
reported, citing officials familiar with the negotiations.  
 BP was successful in arguing that it shouldn’t be liable 
for any economic fallout from President Barack Obama’s decision
to call a six-month moratorium on deep-sea drilling, and also 
rejected a request to pay for anything other than a restoration
of the region’s coastline to conditions existing before the 
April 20 accident, the newspaper said.  
 Obama had pledged to restore the Gulf coast to a condition 
better than it was before the spill, the WSJ said.  
 The deal was grafted onto the 1990 Oil Pollution Act and 
won’t have to go through Congress, the Journal added.
