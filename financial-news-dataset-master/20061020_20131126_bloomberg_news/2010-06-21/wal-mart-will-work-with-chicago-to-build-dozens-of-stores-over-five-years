             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  said it plans
to work with the city of Chicago to build several dozen stores
in the area over the next five years as it seeks new avenues for
growth in the U.S.  
 The  stores  will be of varying size and format, the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said in a statement today.
They would create about 10,000 store employee jobs and 2,000
unionized construction jobs, Wal-Mart said.  
 Neil Currie , an analyst at UBS Securities, has estimated
that Wal-Mart could add about $80 billion in sales if it
achieved a market share in 50 urban areas roughly equal to its
share in non-urban markets. Sales at Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores open
at least a year have fallen for four straight quarters.  
 “Capturing this potential could offer growth investors a
story that has been absent for more than a decade,” Currie said
in an interview. He recommends buying the shares.  
 Wal-Mart’s attempts thus far to enter urban markets like
New York and Chicago have been largely stymied by opposition
from labor unions and community activists, as well as difficulty
obtaining real estate. Wal-Mart currently has one store in
Chicago, which opened in 2006.  
 “We definitely see an opportunity for us to enter other
large cities in the U.S. And we think the way to do that is with
smaller stores and different formats,”  Hank Mullany , executive
vice president and president of Walmart North in the U.S., said
in an interview. He said Wal-Mart will build new stores from the
ground up and take over existing buildings.  
 Chief Executive Officer  Mike Duke  said earlier this month
that Wal-Mart would create 500,000 jobs during the next five
years, and would look to open “a lot of smaller stores.”  
 ‘What Kind of Jobs?’  
 “There is no question in these times that we need jobs --
the question is what kind of jobs they will be, and how the
community will benefit,” said the Reverend Booker Vance, a
spokesman for Good Jobs Chicago, a coalition of local unions,
congregations and community groups.  
 Wal-Mart  said the Chicago stores would pay “competitive
wages,” without providing details, and generate more than $500
million in sales and property taxes. Senior vice president of
Midwest operations Julie Murphy, a 25-year company veteran, will
head up development of the stores, Mullany said.  
 Wal-Mart also plans $20 million in charitable partnerships
during the next five years that will include donating 1.2
million meals a year to Chicago residents and 200,000 meals for
children this summer, the company said.
