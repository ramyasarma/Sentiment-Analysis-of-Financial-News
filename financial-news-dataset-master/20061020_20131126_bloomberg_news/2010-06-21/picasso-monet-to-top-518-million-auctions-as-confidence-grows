             Works by  Pablo Picasso ,  Claude Monet 
and  Henri Matisse  will lead auctions that carry a record
estimate of 350 million pounds ($518 million) as the top end of
the art market recovers from the biggest slump since 1991.  
 Two weeks of evening sales of Impressionist and
contemporary works at Sotheby’s, Christie’s International and
Phillips de Pury & Co. -- starting today -- are estimated to
raise more than three times last year’s total low estimate.  
 “Results over the last six months have made private
sellers confident about putting high-value works into auction,”
 Philip Hoffman , founder of the London-based investment company,
the  Fine Art Fund , said in an interview.  
 Dealers said the market was picking up after recent auction
records such as the $106.5 million paid for a Picasso painting
in New York in May and the 43.2 million euros ($53 million) for
a Modigliani sculpture in Paris on June 14. Sellers are coming
forward even with auction houses no longer guaranteeing prices,
and buyers have started to invest after prices dropped.  
 “The auction houses can assure sellers that there will be
five or six bidders lined up for the top lots,” said Hoffman.
“I’m amazed by how much money and how many different
nationalities are pitching in for the major things. There are
bidders from the U.S., Russia, the Middle East and Asia.”  
 Christie’s sale of 63 Impressionist works tomorrow is
expected to fetch at least 163.7 million pounds, making it the
most valuable art sale to be held in the U.K., said the London-
based auction house. In February, Sotheby’s raised a total of
146.8 million pounds at an Impressionist sale, including the
record 65 million pounds paid for  Alberto Giacometti’s 
sculpture, “Walking Man I.”  
 Absinthe Drinker  
 Christie’s  sale includes Monet’s 1906 painting “Nympheas”
and Picasso’s 1903 “Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto,”
showing one of the artist’s friends drinking absinthe, both of
which are expected to fetch between 30 million pounds and 40
million pounds.  
 The equivalent sale of 51 lots tonight at  Sotheby’s  carries
a minimum valuation of 101 million pounds, the biggest low
estimate the company has ever set for an auction in London.
Highlights include  Edouard Manet’s  1878 “Self Portrait with a
Palette,” entered by  Steven A. Cohen , founder of SAC Capital
Advisors LP, with a high estimate of 30 million pounds, and
Matisse’s never previously auctioned 1928 painting, “Odalisques
jouant aux dames,” at 10 million pounds to 15 million pounds.  
 ‘Turning Corner’  
 “Sellers have been waiting for the market to turn the
corner and prices to clear the high estimates,” the London-
based dealer  Richard Nagy  said in an interview. “There’s been a
build-up of material that should have been sold last year that’s
been held back,” said Nagy, who was one of several underbidders
on the 43.2-million-euro Modigliani in Paris.  
 Nagy was also one of many of the 303 dealers exhibiting at
last week’s Art Basel fair in Switzerland who reported improved
levels of demand.  
 Geneva- and New York-based gallery Krugier sold a 1960
white plaster sculpture by Picasso priced at $15 million and
there were plentiful sales of contemporary works by established
names in the $200,000 to $2 million range, said dealers. The
event attracted a record 62,500 visitors, compared with the
61,000 last year, according to  Art Basel .  
 During the financial crisis, the prices of many
contemporary artists fell by as much as 50 percent and auction
houses slashed estimates to maintain success rates at sales.  
 Average Prices  
 Average auction prices at evening sales of contemporary
works now stand at 2.9 million pounds, up from 1.4 million
pounds last year, the London-based research company  ArtTactic 
said in a report published in May.  
 Sotheby’s and  Christie’s  evening contemporary-art auctions
next week carry low estimates of 38.3 million pounds for 53
works and 40.9 million pounds for 63 lots respectively, more
than double what they were in 2009.  Sotheby’s  is hoping to raise
as much as 6.5 million pounds for a 1961  Yves Klein  sponge
painting on June 28, while  Andy Warhol’s  “Silver Liz” (1963)
carries a high estimate of 8 million pounds at Christie’s on
June 30.  
 Phillips’s  45-lot auction of contemporary works on June 29
is expected to fetch at least 6.1 million pounds, compared with
5.4 million pounds last June. The most highly valued work in the
sale is  Roy Lichtenstein’s  8-foot-wide 1969 spot painting,
“Prop for a Film,” at 500,000 pounds to 700,000 pounds.  
 The June 2009 series of London evening sales had a low
estimate of 100.9 million pounds. The equivalent auctions in
2008 had a low valuation of 334.7 million pounds.
