             Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
advised betting Treasuries will outperform German bunds as
concern the European Central Bank’s bond purchases may leave it
owning “defaulting instruments” boosts demand for U.S. debt.  
 “We are getting closer to a systemic financial collapse,”
 Andrew Roberts , head of European rates strategy in London, said
in a June 18 investor report. “Markets’ fears about who funds
the ECB and what the ECB owns (lots of potentially defaulting
instruments, and growing) implies a clear risk/reward,” he
said. “U.S. Treasuries will outperform bunds. This  spread  can
go flat.”  
 The difference in yield, or spread, between benchmark 10-
year German bunds and Treasuries widened five basis points to 54
basis points as of 10:40 a.m. in London.
