             Prime Minister Kevin Rudd would lose
a federal election as voter support declines in key seats in
Queensland state and the western suburbs of Sydney, the
Australian newspaper reported, citing Newspoll. Seats that
helped Rudd gain power in 2007 are showing swings against the
ruling Labor party of as much as 12 percent, according to
Newspoll’s survey of 1,800 people in the seats between June 18
and 20. The survey had margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points, Newspoll said.
