             North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun
accepted responsibility for a 7-0 World Cup drubbing by Portugal
that eliminated his team with one group game still to play.  
 “Tactically speaking it fell apart,” the coach told
reporters after today’s Group G match at Cape Town’s Green Point
Stadium. “It was my fault for not playing the right strategy.
That’s why we conceded a lot of goals.”  
 North Korea, the soccer tournament’s lowest-ranked nation
at 105th on governing body FIFA’s list, allowed six goals in the
second half to hand Portugal its biggest World Cup victory.
Kim’s team lost 2-1 to Brazil on June 15 in its opening game.  
 The North Koreans have played in one other World Cup,
reaching the quarterfinals in 1966, when they lost 5-3 to a
Eusebio-led Portugal after blowing a 3-0 lead.  
 Eusebio, who scored four goals in that match, watched today
from the stands as Tiago scored twice to lead the rout.  Raul Meireles , Simao,  Hugo Almeida , Liedson and  Cristiano Ronaldo  got
the others as Portugal surpassed its previous biggest World Cup
win, a 4-0 victory over Poland in 2002.  
 “We did what we could to try and keep hold of the ball but
the Portuguese were simply too good,” North Korea forward Jong
Tae Se told reporters. “That’s why we conceded so many goals.”  
 Asked how North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il  was likely to
view the performance, the coach replied: “Back home I believe
they will look at our next game. They will be rooting for us to
play well.”  
 The World Cup comes at a time when tensions on the Korean
peninsula are at the highest in decades, following the alleged
sinking of South Korea’s Cheonan warship by the North in March.  
 North Korea faces Ivory Coast in its last group game on
June 25. Brazil, which has already secured a place in the round
of 16, plays Portugal on the same day.  
 “We’ve still got a chance to pick up our first three
points and that’s what we’ll be trying to do,” Jong added.
