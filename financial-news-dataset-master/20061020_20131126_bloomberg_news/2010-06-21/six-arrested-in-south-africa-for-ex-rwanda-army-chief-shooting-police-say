             South African police arrested six
people for the shooting this weekend of Faustin Kayumba
Nyamwasa, a former Rwandan army chief who lived in Johannesburg,
police spokesman Brigadier Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said.  
 “We are busy with investigations and we expect to make
more arrests,” Mariemuthoo said by phone. The six were expected
to face charges of attempted murder in a Johannesburg court
soon, he said.  
 Mariemuthoo would not give the nationality of the suspects,
saying police would be in touch with Rwandan authorities as part
of the investigation.  
 Nyamwasa, an outspoken critic of Rwandan president  Paul Kagame , was hospitalized after he was shot in the stomach in the
driveway of his home on June 19 and is in stable condition, the
South African Press Association reported.  
 A spokesman for the Rwandan army, Major Jill Rutaremara,
didn’t answer calls by Bloomberg News.
