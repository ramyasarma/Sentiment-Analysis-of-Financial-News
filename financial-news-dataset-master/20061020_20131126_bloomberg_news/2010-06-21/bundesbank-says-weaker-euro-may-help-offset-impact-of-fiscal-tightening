             The Bundesbank said the weaker euro
may help offset the impact of fiscal tightening on German
economic growth.  
 “The short-term damping effect in the euro area of the
additional fiscal consolidation efforts in a number of countries
could be offset somewhat by the weakened euro exchange rate,”
the German central bank said in its monthly report today. “At
the same time, one should not see price as the determining
factor for German exports.”  
 The euro has plunged more than 13 percent against the
dollar since the start of the year on investor concern that a
Greek deficit crisis could spread across the 16-member euro
region. That’s boosting German exports outside the currency
bloc, even as efforts to rein in government spending threaten to
damp domestic demand. The Bundesbank on June 11 raised its
growth forecasts for Europe’s largest economy.  
 Gross domestic product will expand 1.9 percent this year
and 1.4 percent in 2011, the bank predicts. In December, it
estimated the economy would grow 1.6 percent in 2010 and 1.2
percent the following year.  
 German factories are ramping up production and adding
workers to meet booming orders, causing the unemployment rate to
unexpectedly fall to 7.7 percent last month.  
 Even so, the central bank predicts average annual price
gains of 1.2 percent in 2010 and 1.6 percent in 2011, well below
the European Central Bank’s ceiling of 2 percent.
