             ArcelorMittal said output halted at
its Annaba plant in Algeria because of a worker strike.  
 “Production has stopped entirely this morning,” Jean
Lasar, a company spokesman, said today by e-mail. “The company
considers this strike as illegal and is currently seeking an
injunction ordering the strike to be suspended.”
