             Brazil’s real rose for a fifth day,
the longest winning streak since April, as China’s move to relax
the yuan’s peg to the dollar fueled speculation that a stronger
Chinese currency will spur the country’s demand for commodity
exports from South America.  
 The real rose 0.7 percent to 1.7596 per dollar at 8:50 a.m.
New York time, from 1.7721 on June 18. Earlier it touched
1.7512, the strongest level since May 4. The currency
strengthened for five days during the period ended April 14.  
 “Emerging-market commodity-exporting currencies are also
likely to respond more positively, particularly the Brazilian
real,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note to
clients today.  
 The People’s Bank of China said it will end a two-year
currency peg adopted during the global financial crisis to
protect exporters, a sign policy makers expect the world economy
to strengthen. China, the world’s largest copper consumer and
second-biggest user of oil after the U.S., signaled the change
before the G-20 summit in Toronto on June 26-27.  
 In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
contracts due in January fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 11.3 percent.
