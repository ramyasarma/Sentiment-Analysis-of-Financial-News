             Italy hired banks to sell bonds
indexed to 6-month euribor that will mature on Dec. 15, 2015,
the country’s Treasury said today in an e-mail.  
 Italy mandated Banca IMI SpA, BNP Paribas SA, JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and UniCredit
SpA for the sale, according to the e-mailed statement. The sale
will take place “in the near future, subject to market
conditions,” it said.
