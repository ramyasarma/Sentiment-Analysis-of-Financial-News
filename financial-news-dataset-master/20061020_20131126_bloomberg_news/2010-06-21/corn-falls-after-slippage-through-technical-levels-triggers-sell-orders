             Corn fell for the first time in two
weeks on speculation that investors are liquidating positions
after the July contract fell through key technical levels.  
 Futures for July delivery dropped below the 50-day moving
average of $3.6175 a bushel and the 40-day moving average of
$3.60375 a bushel, said analyst  Jerry Gidel . The price then
dropped through the 30-day moving average of $3.58 a bushel. As
prices declined past each technical level, automatic sell orders
were triggered, Gidel said.  
 “Pulling back below Friday’s close is surprising to me,”
said Gidel, a market analyst at North American Risk Management
Service in Chicago. “Maybe we were a little optimistic and got
overenthusiastic this morning” after China said on June 19 that
it would end the yuan’s peg to the dollar, he said.  
 Corn futures for July delivery fell 5.75 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.55 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  
 Futures for December delivery, the most-active contract,
fell 5.75 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.7475 a bushel. Before
today, the price had gained 13 percent since June 7, the last
time futures settled lower.  
 Futures earlier rose as much as 1.7 percent on speculation
that demand would improve after China said it would no longer
peg the yuan at 6.83 to the dollar. The price couldn’t hold
after breaking through the technical levels, Gidel said.  
 “It looks like we have a bunch of panicking here,” Gidel
said. Speculative investors “just follow the charts, and if the
charts don’t do what they expect them to do, they flee the
scene. The price backed off, and when it couldn’t settle against
the moving averages, everybody went out the side door.”  
 Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government figures show. The U.S. is the biggest user of
the grain.
