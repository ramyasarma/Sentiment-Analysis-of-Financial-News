             India’s  bonds  declined on concern
license fees payment by companies to operate high-speed wireless
internet services will drain cash from the banking system.  
 Yields  rose from near a one-week low before tomorrow’s
deadline as operators prepared to pay as much as 385.4 billion
rupees ($8.4 billion) to the government. Banks borrowed an
average 378 billion rupees a day from the  central bank  through
its repurchase-auction window this month. Last month, they lent
a daily average of 328 billion rupees of surplus cash to the RBI.  
 “Liquidity continues to be the main issue as companies are
expected to withdraw cash from banks to pay broadband fees,”
said S. Srikumar, a fixed-income trader at state-owned
Corporation Bank in Mumbai.  
 The yield on the 7.80 percent note due May 2020 rose one
basis point to 7.57 percent as of the 5:30 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The price fell
0.06, or 6 paise per 100-rupee face amount, to 101.58.  
 The central bank said the government bought existing debt
worth 8.07 billion rupees at an auction today after offering to
purchase as much as 100 billion rupees of bonds. The move,
announced after close of trading, was aimed at helping ease a
cash  shortage at banks.   
 The  finance ministry  repurchased 4.05 billion rupees of the
11.3 percent bonds due this year and 4.02 billion rupees of the
6.57 percent notes maturing next year, rejecting all the three
offers of the 12.25 percent debt due this year.  
 The government bought back 83.1 billion rupees worth of
securities last week, less than the 100 billion rupees it
planned. Central bank deputy governor  Subir Gokarn  said today
tightness in liquidity is “not permanent.”  
 The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
decreased, snapping a two-day gain. The rate, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates, fell to 5.42 percent from 5.52
percent on June 18.
