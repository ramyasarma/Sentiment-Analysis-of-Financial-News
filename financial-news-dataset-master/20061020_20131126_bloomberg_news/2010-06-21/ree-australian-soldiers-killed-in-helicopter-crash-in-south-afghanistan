             Three Australian commandos and
another coalition soldier were killed in Afghanistan today when
a helicopter carrying 15 people crashed in northern Kandahar,
Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said.  
 “It wasn’t the result of enemy action,” Houston told
reporters in Canberra today. The crash, taking the Australian
death toll in Afghanistan to five in two weeks, happened in the
early hours of today in difficult terrain, he said. Seven
soldiers were wounded, two of them seriously.  
 The deaths raised the nation’s toll in Afghanistan to 16
since 2002. Two Australian soldiers died earlier this month in
Australia’s first day of multiple fatalities since the Vietnam
War.  
 “We remain very committed to our operational objectives,”
Defense Minister  John Faulkner  told reporters.  
 Australia has about 1,550 soldiers in Afghanistan, with
most based in Uruzgan, as part of Operation Slipper, the
military’s contribution to operations by the NATO-led
International Security Assistance Force.
