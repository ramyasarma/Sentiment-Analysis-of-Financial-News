             Three holiday resorts in Ponta do 
Ouro, Mozambique were destroyed in a fire after an unidentified
woman knocked over a candle in her sleep, News24 said, citing 
Hilton Jessiman, co-owner of The Whaler, one of the resorts.  
 No-one was injured in the blaze that burnt down at least 
110 bungalows and several other buildings at the resorts mainly
aimed at scuba divers, the Johannesburg-based internet news 
site reported.
