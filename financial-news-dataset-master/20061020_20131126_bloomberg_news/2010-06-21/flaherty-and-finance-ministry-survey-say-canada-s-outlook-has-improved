             Canada’s near-term economic
prospects have improved since Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty 
presented his budget in March, the finance department said today
following a survey of private economists.  
 As a result of the stronger growth, the country’s nominal
gross domestic product will be higher than projected in the
budget over the next five years, with a C$30 billion ($29.6
billion) gain in 2010 and a C$24 billion improvement for 2014,
according to the outlook posted on the department’s  website .  
 “We are creating more and better jobs today,” Flaherty
said in a speech in New York today. “Canada’s economic recovery
has also been remarkable.”  
 The Canadian economy  grew  at a 6.1 percent annual rate in
the first quarter, the fastest in a decade, and the Bank of
Canada was the first among G-7 central banks to raise its
 benchmark interest rate  since July 2008. It brought its
overnight target rate to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25
percent on June 1.  
 Canada hosts Group of Eight and G-20 meetings this week,
and Flaherty said nations will need to have fiscal discipline
over the coming years.  
 “There’s been some progress” among the G-20 countries
“about having some targets that would be more ambitious” than
current goals for reducing debt and deficit levels, Flaherty
said. “We will be urging all of our partners” at the G-20
meeting in Toronto “to address the issue of fiscal
consolidation.”  
 GDP Outlook  
 Economists also raised their forecasts for economic growth
this year to 3.5 percent, from 2.6 percent in the budget and 3.1
percent in a March survey. For the 2010-14 period, economists
predicted an average 2.9 percent growth, unchanged from the
budget and the March survey.  
 Canada’s dollar touched the strongest level in more than
five weeks today as China said it may allow the yuan to move
higher, boosting confidence in the global economic recovery and
demand for assets linked to growth.  
 The Canadian currency advanced as much as 0.8 percent to
C$1.0139 per U.S. dollar, the strongest level since May 13,
before trading at C$1.0204 at 12:08 a.m. in Toronto, compared
with C$1.0218 last week. One Canadian dollar buys 98 U.S. cents.  
 Flaherty said the Canadian currency is getting “more
attention” because it is seen as a “safe currency.” Speaking
to reporters after a speech, he acknowledged Russia’s purchase
of Canadian dollars last week and said “we know that other
emerging economies have done the same thing.”  
 GDP Inflation  
 GDP inflation will be faster than earlier predicted, with
readings of 3.2 percent in 2010 and 2.2 percent in 2011 and a
2010-14 average of 2.3 percent, according to the survey. The
budget predicted GDP inflation to be 2.2 percent this year, 2.1
percent next year and to average of 2.1 percent in the 2010-14
period.  
 The  unemployment rate  is now expected to drop faster than
in the March budget. Economists said the jobless rate for 2010
will be 8 percent, compared with May’s 8.1 percent and the 8.5
percent predicted in the budget, according to the release. For
the 2010-14 period, it will average 7.2 percent, compared with
7.4 percent forecast in the budget.
