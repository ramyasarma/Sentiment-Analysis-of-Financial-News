             ICP Asset Management LLC and its
founder Thomas Priore were sued for fraud by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission for their role in trading mortgage-
backed securities at inflated prices as the housing market
declined starting in 2007.  
 The SEC filed the complaint against the firm and Priore at
federal court in New York.
