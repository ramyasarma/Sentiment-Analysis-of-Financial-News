             Turkey’s Treasury sold 3.2 billion
liras ($2.1 billion) of 4 percent inflation-linked bonds 
maturing in 2015 as it sought to diversify its means of 
borrowing.  
 The Treasury in Ankara sold 2.3 billion liras of 
the debt to so-called primary dealers made up of the 
largest banks and state institutions in a non-competitive 
sale, and a net 942 million liras in an auction later at 
a yield of 3.79 percent, according to central bank data.  
 The bonds were priced at an average 102.604.
