             The Australian and New Zealand
dollars gained for a fourth day against the greenback as U.S.
stocks and commodities reversed declines, encouraging demand for
higher-yielding assets.  
 The two South Pacific currencies erased earlier losses as
the  Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 raw materials rose as much
as 0.2 percent after falling 0.7 percent. The  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index  advanced as much as 0.5 percent before trading little
changed. It fell as much as 0.4 percent.  
 “Stocks have come back in the U.S.; that’s given a little
bit of support to the commodity currencies,” said  Amelia Bourdeau , a Stamford, Connecticut-based currency strategist at
UBS AG.  
 Australia’s currency, known as the Aussie, gained 0.3
percent to 87.87 U.S. cents at 12:28 p.m. in New York, from
87.65 cents yesterday, when it climbed to 88.59, the highest
since May 17. Earlier it slipped as much as 0.3 percent. The
currency declined 0.3 percent to 79.63 yen, from 79.85 yen.  
 New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.1 percent
to 70.89 U.S. cents, from 70.82 yesterday, when it advanced to
71.53, the strongest since May 14. Earlier it depreciated as
much as 0.4 percent. It fell 0.5 percent to 64.22 yen,
from 64.52 yen.  
 The currencies earlier fell as China’s yuan declined on
prospects the nation’s central bank will move to limit gains
after dropping a two-year peg to the dollar. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index  of regional shares fell 0.8 percent, snapping an
eight-day gain.  
 China is Australia’s largest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-biggest export market.
