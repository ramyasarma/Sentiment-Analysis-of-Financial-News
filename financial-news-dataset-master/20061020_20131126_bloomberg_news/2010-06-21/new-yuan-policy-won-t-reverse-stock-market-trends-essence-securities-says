             China’s pledge to increase the
flexibility of its exchange rate won’t reverse the trend of the
stock market, as factors that constrain equities still remain,
according to Essence Securities.  
 Shrinking liquidity, slowing economic and corporate
earnings growth and fundraising pressures still exist, analyst
Gao Weidong at Essence Securities said in a report today. The
brokerage said it remains “cautious” about the stock market,
which is the worst performer in Asia this year after the
Shanghai Composite Index’s 23 percent decline.
