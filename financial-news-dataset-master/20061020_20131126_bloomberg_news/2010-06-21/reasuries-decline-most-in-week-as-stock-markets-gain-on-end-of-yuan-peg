             Treasuries pared losses on
speculation the drop in debt in response to China’s decision to
allow a more flexible yuan was too big to be sustained.  
 “The market is coming to the conclusion that it had
overreacted to the news out of China,” said  Charles Comiskey ,
head of Treasury trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New
York. “The policy and what it ultimately means is an open
question. It’s so vague.”  
 Longer-maturity  bonds  led declines after the People’s Bank
of China indicated two days ago it’s abandoning the 6.83 yuan
peg to the dollar adopted during the global financial crisis to
protect exporters. The U.S. will sell $108 billion in two-,
five- and seven-year notes this week.  
 The 10-year note’s yield rose 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.25 percent at 4:10 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in May 2020 dropped 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000
face amount, to 102 5/32.  
 The  yield  on the 10-year note earlier advanced 8.5 basis
points, the most since June 14 on an intraday basis, to 3.30
percent. The two-year note’s yield was little changed at 0.71
percent after increasing 4 basis points to 0.75 percent.  
 “We cheapened up, and at that level, money came into the
market and went to work, especially on the long end, so we came
off the lows,” said  Richard Bryant , senior vice president for
fixed income in New York at MF Global Holdings Ltd., a broker of
exchange-traded futures.  
 Yuan ‘Flexibility’  
 China’s central bank indicated on June 19 that while
there’s no basis for “large scale” moves in the currency, the
exchange rate will be allowed increased “flexibility.” It
ruled out yesterday “large changes” in the exchange rate and
said it will prevent “excessive” moves.  
 “A stronger yuan will make China’s exports more expensive
and is perceived to be inflationary, so Treasury yields are
higher,” wrote  Martin Mitchell , head government bond trader in
Baltimore at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a note to clients.  
 China boosted holdings of Treasury notes and bonds by 2.6
percent to $900.2 billion in March and April, after reducing its
stake by 6.5 percent from November through February, the longest
consecutive monthly declines in a decade, U.S. data released
June 15 showed.  
 The Asian nation’s $22.7 billion in Treasury purchases
during March and April contributed to a $205.2 billion increase
in total foreign holdings. That was the biggest gain since
$211.3 billion in June and July of 2009.  
 Note Auctions  
 The U.S. government will auction $40 billion in two-year
debt tomorrow, $38 billion in five-year notes on the following
day and $30 billion in seven-year securities on June 24. The
total is $5 billion less than last month’s sales.  
 “The two-year auction won’t be a home run, but demand in
the front end is still relatively strong,” said  Jason Rogan ,
director of U.S. government trading in New York at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a brokerage for institutional investors.  
 Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 36 percent of the two-year notes at the
prior auction on May 25, compared with an average of 42 percent
over the past 10 sales.  
 The Federal Reserve will hold the benchmark  interest rate 
at a record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent at the end of its
two-day meeting on June 23, according to all of the 93
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  
 ‘Extended Period’  
 U.S. policy makers reiterated on April 28 that they
intended to keep the benchmark rate at virtually zero for an
“extended period” to help spur the recovery.  
 Treasury futures may extend their drop after evidence last
week that the U.S. economic recovery is losing momentum failed
to push prices above their recent range, according to CRT
Capital Group LLC.  
 “The market’s fully priced,”  David Ader , head of
government bond strategy in Stamford, Connecticut, at CRT. “The
technical patterns are bearish. We’re going to take a step
down.”  
 Futures may fall through a support level of 119 24/32,
Ader wrote in an e-mailed note today. While the level of 119
13/32 is “good for a stall,” momentum may push the price as
low as 118 26/32, according to Ader.  
 Economic reports last week showing a drop in consumer
prices and housing starts and an increase in unemployment claims
didn’t fuel enough demand for U.S. debt to push futures above
their range of 114 26/32 to 122 14/32 since the start of March.  
 The implied yield on 10-year Treasury futures contracts for
September delivery rose today two basis points to 3.57 percent.
The price fell 5/32 to 120 9/32.
