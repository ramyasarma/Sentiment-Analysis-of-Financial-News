             The German market for private
customer business has a structural deficiency and savings banks
have an unfair advantage, according to  Roberto Nicastro ,
 UniCredit SpA ’s deputy chief executive officer, the Financial
Times Deutschland reported.  
 As German Landesbanks were rescued by the states that own
them, the savings banks, as part-owners of the Landesbanks,
escaped relatively unscathed, the  FTD  cited Nicastro as saying.
For banks that had to go through the financial crisis without
any form of state aid, that represented a significant
disadvantage, the newspaper cited him as saying.
