             SABMiller Plc’s Zambian Breweries
unit raised 400 billion kwacha through a syndicated loan
facility from a group of banks, including Absa Capital, Barclays
Plc’s Zambian unit, Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc’s
business in the country, Absa Capital said.  
 The loan, guaranteed by London-based SABMiller, will be
used to refinance existing bank facilities, Johannesburg-based
Absa Capital said in an e-mailed statement today. The facilities
are split between a 340 billion kwacha loan and 60 billion
kwacha revolving credit facility, both of which have a three-
year term, it said.
