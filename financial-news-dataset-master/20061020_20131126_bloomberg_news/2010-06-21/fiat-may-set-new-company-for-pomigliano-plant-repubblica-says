             Fiat SpA , Italy’s largest
manufacturer, may create a new company for its Pomigliano d’Arco
factory near Naples, la Repubblica reported, without saying
where it got the information.  
 Under the plan, Fiat would rehire in the new company
employees who are ready to work longer shifts, after failing to
win a full agreement from unions on longer hours to boost
production, the newspaper said.
