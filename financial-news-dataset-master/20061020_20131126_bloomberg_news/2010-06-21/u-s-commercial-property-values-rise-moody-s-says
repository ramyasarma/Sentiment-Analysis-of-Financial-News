             U.S. commercial real estate  values 
rose in April for the first time in three months, according to
Moody’s Investors Service.  
 The Moody’s/REAL Commercial Property Price  Index  climbed
1.7 percent from March, Moody’s said today in a report. Prices
slid 16 percent from a year earlier and are down 41 percent from
the October 2007 peak.  
 Economic growth in the second half of 2009 and first
quarter of this year have helped lift prices for offices,
warehouses and stores from an October low. Property sales jumped
50 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to $15.4
billion, Real Capital Analytics Inc., a commercial real estate
research company in New York, said April 22.  
 “What we have is a bottom in the market,” Christopher
Cornell, an economist at Moody’s Economy.com in West Chester,
Pennsylvania, said in a telephone interview. “We have seen
essentially a flat trend in commercial property prices in the
last several months.”
