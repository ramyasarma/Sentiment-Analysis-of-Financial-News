             Rubber climbed by the most in a week
after China signaled it will unshackle the yuan’s fixed rate to
the dollar, stoking speculation the world’s largest consumer may
boost imports of the commodity used in tires.  
 Futures in Tokyo climbed as much as 3.6 percent, extending
last week’s rally. The price neared a two-week high of 286.7 yen
reached on June 16 amid optimism that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis may not stall global recovery.  
 The People’s Bank of China said on June 19 it may allow the
yuan to move higher, making imports more affordable to buyers in
the world’s third-largest economy. Asian shares and commodities
surged while the dollar weakened against major counterparts as
China’s move boosted investor confidence.  
 “A stronger yuan would encourage Chinese tire makers to
increase rubber purchases from overseas to cut costs,”  Takaki Shigemoto , an analyst at research and investment company JSC
Corp. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  
 November-delivery rubber gained as much as 10 yen to 284.4
yen per kilogram ($3,134 a metric ton) before settling at 282.6
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.  
 November-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
added 2.2 percent to 21,675 yuan ($3,183) a ton. Earlier, the
price increased to 22,200 yuan, the highest level since June 3.  
 China, the world’s largest auto market, is also the biggest
user of natural rubber. The nation may boost gross imports of
the raw material to 1.68 million tons this year from 1.59
million in 2009, according to the May report from the
Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries.

 China’s production of natural rubber may grow to 680,000
tons this year from 645,800 tons in 2009, the report said.  
 “Domestic rubber will become more expensive than imported
product if the yuan strengthens against the dollar,” Shigemoto
said. Raw material imports will climb unless a higher Chinese
currency hurts tire exports, he said.  
 China’s central bank indicated it’s abandoning the 6.83
yuan peg to the dollar adopted during the global financial
crisis to shield exporters. American lawmakers had argued that
the yuan peg was an unfair subsidy for China’s exporters. A
stronger yuan may allow policy makers the ability to stanch
inflation without curbing economic growth.  
 “It’s a vote of confidence in Asia and in risk appetite
and a reduction in the dangers of a trade war,” said  Sean Callow , a currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney.  
 Global rubber output may total 9.7 million to 10.2 million
tons this year as drought and heavy rainfall in key producing
countries including Thailand and Indonesia damage supply,
Stephen Evans, the secretary-general of the International Rubber
Study Group, said in an interview last week. That compares with
the group’s forecast range of 10.1 million to 10.6 million tons
on March 17.  
 Demand will probably increase by 4.4 percent this year to
9.8 million tons, based on the assumption that the economic
recovery will slow, Evans said. The group forecast 10.2 million
tons in March.
