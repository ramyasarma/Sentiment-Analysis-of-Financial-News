             A dozen international investors
asked Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  to
reject any proposal to reduce subsidies for plants that generate
power with photovoltaic panels, Cinco Dias reported.  
 The investors, including HgCapital and Hudson Clean Energy,
asked the Socialist premier to publicly oppose cuts for plants
that are already in operation, according to the article, which
cited a letter they wrote to Zapatero.  
 The funds and insurers together have invested more than 3
billion euros ($3.7 billion) in photovoltaic installations, the
report said.
