             Japanese and Australian  stock 
futures fell after Fitch Ratings downgraded Paris-based BNP
Paribas SA and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services said Spanish
lenders face difficult years because of the nation’s slow growth.  
 American depositary receipts of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. , Japan’s second-biggest bank by market value, closed
3.3 percent down from the Tokyo close yesterday as Citigroup Inc.
slashed its price estimate on the stock by 38 percent. Those of
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. slid 1.3 percent.
ADRs of Advantest Corp., the world’s largest maker of memory-
chip testers, jumped 1.3 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said
the company may report quarterly orders more than doubled.  
 “We have to remain vigilant about Europe’s situation,”
said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at SMBC Friend Securities
Co. in Tokyo. “A country’s fiscal position doesn’t turn around
in just one or two days.”  
 Yen-denominated futures  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average 
expiring in September closed at 10,160 in Chicago yesterday, 0.7
percent lower than 10,230 in Osaka. They were  bid  in the pre-
market at 10,150 as of 8:19 a.m. in Osaka. The Nikkei 225 closed
at 10,238.01 yesterday.  
 Futures on Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index  fell 0.7 percent.
New Zealand’s  NZX 50 Index  lost 0.2 percent.  
 The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  surged 2.6 percent yesterday to
the highest close since May 14 after China’s central bank said
on June 19 that the exchange rate will be allowed increased
“flexibility.” The advance lifted the average price of shares
in the gauge to 15 times estimated earnings, up from almost a
17-month low of 13.8 times on May 18.  
 Spanish Banks  
 Fitch cut its long-term credit rating on BNP Paribas,
France’s largest bank, by one step to AA-, citing a
“deterioration” of the company’s asset quality. The report
came as Standard & Poor’s slashed its economic growth forecast
for Spain to the average of 0.7 percent a year through 2016 from
1 percent, saying Spanish banks face mounting credit losses and
“substantial strain” on revenue generation.  
 Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. Yesterday, the gauge erased its early gain in the final
hour of trading to close down 0.4 percent in New York.  
 Advantest may post more than 30 billion yen ($330 million)
in orders in the quarter to June, which was 2.6 times as much as
a year earlier, the Nikkei reported today, citing President
Haruo Matsuno.  
 Sumitomo Mitsui had its price estimate cut by Citigroup to
4,500 yen from 7,200 yen. Citi slashed its price target for
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.  by a third to 600 yen and
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc.  by 38 percent to 250 yen. Citi
maintained its “buy” ratings on the Japanese banks.  
 Chinese property prices in larger cities are poised to
steadily decline as government measures start to take effect,
the National Development and Reform Commission said in a report
yesterday relating to 36 large and medium-sized cities. It
didn’t name the cities.
