             Germany’s support for renewable
energy is “breaking” the nation’s ability to pay for power and
threatens the competitiveness of electricity producers,
 Handelsblatt  cited a former industry group leader as saying.  
 Guaranteed prices for solar and wind power, paid for by
consumers, are threatening the renewable-energy industry’s
ability to compete, the report said, citing  Johannes Lackmann ,
the former head of Germany’s BEE renewable-energy lobby group.  
 Installations of solar panels may more than double this
year to 9,000 megawatts, Handelsblatt said. That may help to
boost the total cost of installed solar capacity in Germany to
85.4 billion euros ($106 billion) from 2000 to 2010, according
to a study by the RWI economic institute, Handelsblatt said.
