             Ralcorp Holdings Inc. , the St.
Louis-based producer of Post cereals, agreed to buy  American
Italian Pasta Co.  for about $1.2 billion in cash, to gain
control of the biggest maker of dry pasta in North America.  
 The $53-a-share price is 27 percent more than American
Italian’s closing price as of June 18. The purchase will add at
least 50 cents a share to earnings in fiscal 2010, Ralcorp said
today in a statement.  
 The “significant” earnings boost a buyer would get from
American Italian Pasta leaves open the possibility that a rival
bidder may emerge and offer a higher price, said  Tim Ramey , an
analyst for D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon.  
 “This is a fair but not full valuation,” Ramey, who
recommends buying American Italian Pasta, wrote today in a note.
Davidson  owned 17,300  of the company’s shares as of March, a
stake of less than 1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. “We wouldn’t rule out another bidder stepping in,”
Ramey said.  
 Ralcorp dropped $4.89, or 7.9 percent, to $57.28 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , the
largest decline since November 2008. American Italian, the
Kansas City, Missouri-based maker of Mueller’s, jumped $10.93,
or 26 percent, to $52.66 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  
 Target Valuation  
 Ralcorp’s offer values the pasta maker at 7.3 times its
2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, Ramey said, and 6.8 times his 2011 earnings
estimate using the same measure.  
 American Italian’s sales topped $600 million last year,
with about 80 percent of that coming from customers who sell its
pasta through retail channels. Ralcorp is adding generic brands
as consumers eat at home more and hunt for bargains to save
money.  
 Ralcorp has  purchased  more than 20 companies in the past
decade, co-Chief Executive Officer  Kevin Hunt  said on a
conference call regarding the acquisition. The company makes
cereal and other products for retail chains that sell them under
their own store brands. Also called private-label brands, the
products often come at a 25 percent discount to national brands
because they aren’t as heavily advertised, according to
Ralcorp’s website.  
 American Italian will become a unit of Ralcorp and will
report to Hunt, who oversees the snacks, sauces and spreads
division. The purchase, which will be funded through existing
credit facilities and a new bridge loan, probably will close by
Sept. 30, Ralcorp said.  
 The company also said it bought two Canadian cracker
bakeries, North American Baking Ltd. and J.T. Bakeries Inc., for
undisclosed sums.  
 Ralcorp also announced that diluted  earnings  per share for
the third quarter probably will be $1. That compares with the
$1.29 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
