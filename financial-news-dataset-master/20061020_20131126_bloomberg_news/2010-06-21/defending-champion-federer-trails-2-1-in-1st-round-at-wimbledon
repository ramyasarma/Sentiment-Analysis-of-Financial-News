             Roger Federer won the third set of
his first round match against Alejandro Falla at the Wimbledon
tennis championship today after losing the opening two.  
 The Swiss, seeking to tie Pete Sampras’s Open era men’s
record of seven titles at the All England Club, hasn’t lost in
the first round of a Grand Slam since the French Open seven
years ago.  
 Colombia’s Falla, who failed to take a set off Federer in
their four previous matches, leads 7-5, 6-4, 4-6.
