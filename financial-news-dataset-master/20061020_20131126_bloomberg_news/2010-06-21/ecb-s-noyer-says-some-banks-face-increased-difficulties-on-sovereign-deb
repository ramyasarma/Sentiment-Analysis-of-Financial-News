             European Central Bank governing
council member Christian Noyer said some banks have faced
funding difficulties in the wake of Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis.  
 “Some banks have started facing increasing funding
problems,” Noyer said at a conference in Paris. “The situation
reflects a general state of uncertainty which, left unchecked,
could have significant consequences on financial stability and
the real economy, as was the case during the last part of
2008.”
