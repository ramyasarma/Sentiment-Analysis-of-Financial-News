             Maliz Beams , one of the highest-
ranking women at TIAA-CREF, is leaving the firm, which oversees
$426 billion in retirement assets.  
 Edward Van Dolsen , 52, was named chief operating officer
and will assume Beams’s responsibilities, the New York-based
firm said today in an e-mailed statement. Beams, 54, oversaw all
of TIAA-CREF’s services for individual and institutional
clients.  
 Beams, named among the top 25 non-bank women executives in
finance last year by the American Banker magazine, joined TIAA-
CREF in 2004 as the head of its wealth-management business.
Before that, she was a partner and managing director at Zurich
Scudder Investments.  
 “Under Maliz’ leadership, we’ve grown our individual and
institutional businesses significantly despite these challenging
economic times,”  Roger Ferguson , the chief executive of TIAA-
CREF said.  
 As part of a plan to make TIAA-CREF more “client-
focused,” the firm said  Marvin Adams  will oversee a shared-
services group that includes business support such as technology
and operations.  
 TIAA-CREF, founded in 1918 as a pension fund for
professors, is the largest provider of retirement plans for
employees of academic, medical and research institutions. The
firm also sells mutual funds and education-savings plans.
