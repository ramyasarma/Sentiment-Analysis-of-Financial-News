             Belgian manufacturers plan to
increase capital spending by 11 percent this year after a 20
percent drop in 2009, according to the National Bank of
Belgium’s bi-annual investment survey.  
 The projected 11 percent increase is smaller than the 13
percent recovery estimated six months ago, when 2009 capital
spending was forecast to decline by 22 percent, the bank said
today in an e-mailed statement.
