             Taiwan’s  export orders  rose for an
eighth consecutive month in May as Europe’s debt crisis failed
to damp demand for the island’s computers and television screens.  
 Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, advanced 34.03 percent from a year earlier, after a
35.15 percent gain in April, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs 
said in Taipei today. The median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey  was for a 37.9 percent rise.  
 Growing demand for Taiwan’s products in China spurred a
13.3 percent expansion of the economy last quarter, the biggest
gain in more than 30 years, and helped  Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co.  post record monthly sales in May. President  Ma Ying-jeou  is aiming to sign a trade accord with China at the end
of this month that will cut tariffs on Taiwanese products.  
 “Asia’s exporters are benefiting from China’s strong
appetite for household appliances, computers and mobile
phones,”  Lucas Lee , an economist at Mega Securities Co. in
Taipei, said ahead of the release. “However, concerns about
Europe’s debt problem will begin to affect sentiment and slow
overall external growth in the second half.”  
 The European Union last month announced a 750 billion-euro
($934 billion) rescue package to shore up the finances of the
region’s weakest economies amid concern governments will
struggle to tackle their budget deficits.  
 Interest Rates  
 Taiwan may this week join central banks in Asia including
Indonesia and South Korea in  keeping borrowing costs  unchanged
as it gauges the fallout from Europe’s debt crisis, Lee said.  
 Taiwan Semiconductor, the world’s biggest custom-chip maker,
said June 10 its unconsolidated sales surged 38.3 percent to
NT$33.8 billion in May. Chairman  Morris Chang  last week raised
his forecast on the growth of global chip-industry sales to
“nearly 30 percent” this year, compared with an April estimate
of 22 percent.  
 Today’s figures were released after the close of trading on
the stock exchange. The Taiex index rose 1.9 percent to 7,635.56,
its highest level since May 14. The Taiwan dollar advanced 1.4
percent to NT$31.741 versus the U.S. dollar as of 2:54 p.m.
local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  
 The value of export orders dropped to $33.73 billion last
month from $33.96 billion in April, today’s report showed.  
 Export orders from China and Hong Kong combined increased
34.34 percent last month, after a 40.7 percent gain in April.
Orders from the U.S. climbed 20.32 percent from a year earlier,
after a 23.58 percent rise in April.  
 Initial Agreement  
 Taiwan and China reached an initial agreement on tariff
reductions for a total of 750 items after a third round of talks
in Beijing on June 13 on the so-called Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement.  
 President Ma has been pushing for an accord to bolster
export-dependent Taiwan’s economy after a Chinese trade
agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations began
this year. Ma, who took office in May 2008, is also seeking
better relations with the island’s  biggest trading partner  and
No. 1 investment destination.  
 Orders for electronics rose 32.75 percent last month after
a 33.22 percent increase in April, today’s report showed. Demand
for information technology and communications products climbed
39.25 percent in May after increasing 35.96 percent a month
earlier.
