             Petroleo Brasileiro SA  plans to 
start a partnership with Sao Martinho SA that will help the 
Brazilian sugar producer bring forward a plan to increase its 
crushing capacity to 30 million metric tons per year by 2020, 
Valor Economico reported.  
 Petrobras would help complete construction of a Sao 
Martinho sugar mill and start a project in Goias state, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, citing an unidentified person from 
the state-controlled oil producer. Petrobras plans to announce 
the agreement today, Valor said.  
 A Petrobras official in Rio de Janeiro wasn’t immediately 
able to comment on the story when contacted by Bloomberg News 
before regular working hours today.
