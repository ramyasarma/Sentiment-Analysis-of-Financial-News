             Companies are marketing $2.94
billion of debt in the U.S. as investors increase deposits in
mutual funds that invest in high-yield, high-risk bonds,
reversing 5 straight weeks of withdrawals.  
 Flows into junk-bond funds totaled $164 million in the week
ended June 16, according to EPFR Global, which tracks asset
allocation and is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Investors
had removed $6.27 billion from the funds since May, EPFR said.  
 High-yield debt returned 1.82 percent last week, the most
since the period ended Jan. 8, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. That shows that investors are
increasingly confident Europe’s sovereign debt crisis won’t
derail the U.S. economy, said  Martin Fridson , global credit
strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.  
 Investors “do not think the European banks’ problems with
sovereign debt exposure will cause global credit markets to
seize up, creating adverse consequence from the U.S. real
economy,” Fridson said in an e-mail.  
 The extra yield investors demand to own debt rated below
Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s
fell 9 basis points on June 18 to 682 basis points, the lowest
in a month, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
High-Yield Master II Index.  
 Citgo Petroleum sold $300 million of seven-year notes in
the day’s only U.S. corporate bond sale, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The notes priced to yield 11.75 percent,
or 906 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  
 Weekly Sales  
 Companies sold $1.35 billion of high-yield debt last week,
Bloomberg data show. Weekly junk bond sales have averaged $1.36
billion since May 7, compared with $6.06 billion in the first
four months of the year, the data show.  
 Total Capital, Europe’s third-largest oil company after
Royal Dutch Shell BV and BP Plc, issued $2.5 billion of debt,
and Bank of America Corp., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, sold
$3 billion of notes to lead $16.8 billion of investment-grade
offerings, the most in a week since the period ending April 16,
Bloomberg data show.  
 Spreads on investment-grade debt tightened 1 basis point to
208 basis points, the narrowest since June 7, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index.  
 Following is a description of the $2.94 billion pending
sales of dollar-denominated bonds in the U.S.

sheet,  Raghavan Seetharaman  said in a June 16 telephone
