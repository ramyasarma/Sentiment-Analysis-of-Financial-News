             Andrew J. Hall , the former Citigroup
Inc. energy trader whose proposed $100 million payout became a
symbol of excessive Wall Street compensation, raised $1.08
billion for the offshore version of a commodities fund.  
 Hall’s firm, now owned by  Occidental Petroleum Corp. , lined
up 37 investors for its Astenbeck Offshore Commodities Fund II
Ltd., according to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The fund began raising money in 2008,
the filing shows.  
 Citigroup last year sold the trading firm, then known as
Phibro LLC, after the New York-based bank came under pressure
from the Obama administration to reduce a potential $100 million
payout to Hall, who made a similar amount in 2008. The $250
million purchase price was less than Phibro’s average annual
pretax profit of $371 million in the prior five years.  
 Michael Young , an executive vice president at Astenbeck
Capital Management LLC in Westport, Connecticut, declined to
comment on the filing.  
 Phibro, formed as Philipp Brothers in 1901 to buy and sell
everything from aluminum to grains, began to concentrate on
energy trading during the 1970s. Citigroup, which took control
of Phibro when it bought Travelers Cos. in 1998, opened the
proprietary trading business to outside investors in 2007
through a pair of partnerships called Phibro Oil Funds A and B.  
 22% Return  
 The firm mostly trades oil and refined products along with
electric power, coal, metals and equities, according to
marketing documents for Astenbeck Commodities II. The offshore
fund 22 percent after fees from the start of 2008 through August
2009, according to the documents. That compares with the 44
percent decline by the  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index .  
 Park Hill Group LLC, a unit of New York-based Blackstone
Group LP, helped with the offering. Park Hill, which recruits
investors for hedge funds and buyout firms, will receive an
estimated $7.5 million in sales commissions, the filing shows.  
 A U.S. hedge fund is often comprised of two separate
partnerships, including an onshore vehicle for investors subject
to federal taxes, including wealthy individuals. The offshore
version, usually incorporated in the Cayman or Virgin Islands,
is marketed to those exempt from paying U.S. taxes, including
foreign investors and domestic pension plans.  
 The onshore partnership for Astenbeck Commodities Fund II,
formerly known as Phibro Commodities Fund II LP, reported in
February that it had raised about $148 million.  
 Citigroup and Hall agreed to defer his compensation until
2010, when it was to be paid by Occidental, after it determined
his contract couldn’t be altered, people familiar with the
matter said in October.
