             Barnes & Noble Inc. , the largest
U.S. bookstore chain, cut the price of its Nook digital reader
by 23 percent amid competition from  Borders Group Inc.  and
Amazon.com Inc.  
 The Nook, released last year for $259 each, will now sell
for $199, New York-based Barnes & Noble said today in a
statement. The device had been selling for the same price as
Amazon.com’s market leading Kindle. Barnes & Noble also released
a version of the Nook for $149 that doesn’t have access to the
3G network while still offering wireless Web access.  
 Borders , the second largest U.S. bookstore chain, began
selling Kobo Inc.’s e-reader in May for $149.99 and a device
from Aluratek Inc. this month for $119.99. The bookstore chains
are fighting for position as U.S. sales of digital reading
devices are projected to reach 5 million units this year from
2.2 million in 2009, according to estimates from the Consumer
Electronics Association, an industry trade group.  
 Sales of digital books more than doubled to $27.4 million
in April from a year earlier, while revenue from all forms of
books rose 25 percent to $629.8 million, according to the
Association of American Publishers.
