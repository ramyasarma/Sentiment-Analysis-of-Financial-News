             Trading of bearish options on U.S.
materials and chemicals companies surged after an investor bet
that the industry’s shares will fall in the next month.  
 More than 73,000 puts on the  Materials Select Sector SPDR
Trust  changed hands, seven times the four-week average and the
most since May 4. The exchange-traded fund tracking 32 companies
rose 0.6 percent to $31.14. An investor bought 30,000 of the
July $32 puts while selling the same amount of July $30 puts, a
spread trade that pays the most if the stock falls below the
lower strike price by July 16.  
 “The trading implies that the investor is speculating on
near-term weakness,” options strategists at  Susquehanna
International Group LLP  in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, said in a
report sent to clients today.  
 The ETF fell 6.2 percent this year through June 18 as
concern that the debt crisis in Europe will curb global economic
growth intensified. DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S. chemical
maker, is the ETF’s largest holding, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. It’s followed by Dow Chemical Co.,  Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.  and Monsanto Co. The four companies
account for 36 percent of the security.
