             Synovus Financial Corp. , the Georgia
bank that lost $2.3 billion since 2008, said Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Richard Anthony  will take a medical leave of
absence. The lender named Kessel D. Stelling Jr. as his
temporary replacement.  
 Anthony, 64, who has been with the Columbus-based company
since 1993 and became CEO in 2005, was diagnosed with Wegener’s
Syndrome, a blood vessel disorder that “will require intensive
treatment,” the company said in a statement. Stelling, 54, who
joined Synovus in 2008, was named president and chief operating
officer in February.  
 “We are hopeful for a quick and speedy recovery,” Stelling
said in a telephone interview today. “It became apparent that he
needs to focus on his health and recovery instead of the day-to-
day operations of the bank.”  
 Synovus has reported seven straight quarterly losses,
mainly from defaults on loans by developers and home builders.
It hasn’t repaid a $968 million bailout from the Troubled Asset
Relief Program and in March disclosed an informal Securities and
Exchange Commission inquiry.  
 Anthony is being treated at the University of Alabama
Medical Center in Birmingham.
