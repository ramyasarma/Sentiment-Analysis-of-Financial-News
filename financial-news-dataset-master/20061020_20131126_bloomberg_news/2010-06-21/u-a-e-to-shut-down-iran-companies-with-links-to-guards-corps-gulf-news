             The United Arab Emirates will shut 
down businesses with links to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps
and any other entities targeted by United Nations sanctions, 
the Gulf News reported, citing an unidentified official source.  
 The U.A.E. has closed down more than 40 companies in a 
crackdown on money laundering and sales of equipment with a 
dual military-civilian use, the newspaper reported. The 
government is tightening restrictions on Iran after the U.N. 
Security Council on June 9 imposed a fourth round of sanctions 
against the Iranian government because of its nuclear program, 
targeting in particular the Revolutionary Guards, the 
Dubai-based newspaper said.
