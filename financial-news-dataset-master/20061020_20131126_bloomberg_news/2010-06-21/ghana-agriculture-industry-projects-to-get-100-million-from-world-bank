             Ghana’s agricultural industry will
receive $100 million from the World Bank this year to fund
projects aimed at boosting production in the West African
nation, the Finance Ministry said.  
 The money, which may be handed out in July, will be used
for road-building in farming communities, irrigation projects
and farm equipment, said Gladys Ghartey, director of the World
Bank unit at the Accra-based ministry.  
 The Washington-based lender had initially planned to give
$50 million over three years to 2011 to Ghana’s agricultural
industry, Ghartey said in an interview June 18.  
 The increased funding comes because the projects “are in
line with the government’s medium-term plan of developing the
commercial agricultural base,” she said.  
 Ghana is the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer, after
neighboring Ivory Coast. It exports small amounts of other
produce including pineapples, coffee and sheanuts.
