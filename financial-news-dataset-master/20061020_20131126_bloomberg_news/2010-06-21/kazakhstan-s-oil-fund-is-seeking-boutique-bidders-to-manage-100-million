             Kazakhstan’s national oil fund may
delay a decision on the management of as much as $100 million of
its funds in an effort to attract more offers from smaller
investment companies, the central bank said.  
 The  National Oil Fund of Kazakhstan , which the government
created to guard against a decline in crude oil prices, is
trying to attract bids from global equity investors who conduct
active management, Anuar Izbassarov, an official at the Almaty-
based central bank’s treasury department, said by phone today.
The original deadline was July 5, he said.  
 The bank, which is seeking to diversify the management of
Kazakhstan’s oil wealth, wants to attract “a small boutique
investment company” to manage between $50 million and $100
million, Izbassarov said. It would be the first time the country
sought out smaller investors, he said.  
 The bidders must have at least $5 billion under management
and invest for at least 5 years in shares and indexes, the
central bank said.  
 The oil fund’s reserves rose to $26.4 billion in May from
$25.8 billion in April. Kazakhstan holds 3 percent of the
world’s oil reserves, according to BP Plc.
