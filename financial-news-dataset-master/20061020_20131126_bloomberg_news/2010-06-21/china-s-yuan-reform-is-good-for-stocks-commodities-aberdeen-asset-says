             Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which
oversees $259 billion, said stocks, commodities and other
“risk” assets will advance following China’s decision to allow
a more flexible yuan.  
 The Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollar may
outpace the Chinese currency as policy makers follow China’s
lead in allowing more flexibility in foreign-exchange controls,
 Adam McCabe , a portfolio manager in Singapore, wrote in an e-
mail. The company increased its holding of the won, ringgit and
Indian rupee in the second quarter, he said.  
 The reform of the yuan highlighted China’s “confidence in
the resilience of the region’s economies despite the ongoing
headwinds that southern Europe faces,” McCabe wrote. “This is
a positive gesture. On balance, it will be seen to be net
positive for equities, commodities and risk generally as we
recover from the European-based sell-off in May.”  
 The yuan rose the most since a July 2005 revaluation and
forwards jumped after China’s central bank ended a two-year peg
before a Group of 20 summit this week.  The MSCI World Index
climbed for a 10th day and oil and copper advanced.  
 “During Q2, we have maintained our outlook for the Asian
economies while the structural case for a gradual appreciation
of Asian currencies versus the U.S. dollar remains intact,”
McCabe wrote.
