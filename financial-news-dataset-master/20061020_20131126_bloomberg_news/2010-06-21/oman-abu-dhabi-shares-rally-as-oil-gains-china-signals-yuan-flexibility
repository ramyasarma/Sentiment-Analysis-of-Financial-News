             Oman and Abu Dhabi shares advanced,
helping lead Gulf Arab markets higher, after China signaled it
will relax the yuan’s peg to the dollar, boosting confidence in
the global economic recovery. Oil rose to a six-week high.  
 Oman Cables Industry SAOG  surged to the highest intraday
level since June 3 after the company was raised to
“overweight” at Taib Bank.  National Bank of Abu Dhabi , the
United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest lender, gained 4.3 percent.
Oman’s  benchmark  gauge jumped 2 percent, the most in more than
six months, to 6,257.8 as of 1:22 p.m. in Muscat. Abu Dhabi’s
 ADX General Index  climbed 0.9 percent to 2,559.81, the highest
level in two weeks. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  gained for a
third day, rising 1.8 percent.  
 “Positive movements in global markets have a direct impact
on local markets,” said  Ziad Dabbas , a financial analyst at the
National Bank of Abu Dhabi. “The U.A.E. markets are oversold
and prices appear attractive.”  
 The People’s Bank of China said on June 19 it will allow
greater “flexibility” in its currency, which has been kept at
about 6.83 per dollar since July 2008 to protect exporters.
A stronger currency will boost the purchasing power of
households in China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
Emerging-market stocks rose, driving the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index  to its biggest gain in three weeks.  
 Economic Recovery  
 Crude climbed to the highest in six weeks on speculation
that demand may increase in China, the world’s second-largest
energy consumer. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, made up of the U.A.E., Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman and Bahrain, supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  
 Oil for July delivery rose as much as $1.69, or 2.2
percent, to $78.87 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That’s the highest price since May 6.
Abu Dhabi’s  ADX Energy Index  advanced 1.8 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in two weeks.  
 The global economy is “gradually recovering and the upturn
in the Chinese economy has become more solid,” the People’s
Bank of China said in a statement announcing the action.  
 The MSCI World Index  of developed nations rose 0.8 percent
and the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  expiring in September gained
1.5 percent. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  jumped 2.4 percent
to 976.733, set for the biggest advance since May 26.  
 NBAD advanced to 11 dirhams, the highest since May 26. Oman
Cables, the biggest cables and wires maker by market value,
climbed 4.2 percent to 1.094 rials. The company was assigned a
share-price estimate of 1.24 rials at Taib.  
 Qatar’s  QE Index  rose 1.1 percent, Bahrain’s  gauge  gained
0.3 percent and Dubai’s  measure  climbed for a third day,
advancing 0.7 percent.  The Kuwait Stock Exchange Index  advanced
less than 0.1 percent, while Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share
Index  jumped 0.5 percent to 6,445.09.
