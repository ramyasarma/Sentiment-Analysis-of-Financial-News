             Brazil’s central bank will raise the
benchmark interest rate more than previously forecast as Latin
America’s biggest economy expands at a faster pace, a central
bank  survey  of about 100 economists published today showed.  
 For the 14th straight week, analysts increased their
forecast for economic growth, according to the survey taken June
18. The  economy  will grow 7.06 percent this year, up from a
week-earlier forecast of 6.99 percent, prompting policy makers
to raise the Selic to 12 percent by year-end, the analysts
predicted. Analysts in the June 11 survey had forecast a
benchmark rate of 11.75 percent.  
 The central bank will raise the benchmark interest rate at
three of the remaining four meetings scheduled for 2010, pausing
in October, the survey showed.  
 “Though we cannot totally discard this scenario, we don’t
expect it,”  Diego Donadio , an economist with BNP Paribas in Sao
Paulo, said in a phone interview. “This pause would be because
of elections.” Brazilians go to the polls in October to elect a
new president.
  The survey showed that economists expect Brazil’s  inflation 
rate to be at 4.83 percent in 12 months, up from a week-earlier
forecast of 4.76 percent. Economists kept their 2010 inflation
forecast at 5.61 percent and their 2011 inflation forecast at
4.8 percent, the survey showed.  
 Policy makers  target  inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus
two percentage points.  
 Growth, Election  
 Brazil’s economy  expanded  9 percent in the first quarter
over the same period a year ago, the national statistics agency
reported June 8. Growth will slow to 4.5 percent next year,
according to today’s survey.  
 The central bank will raise the  Selic  rate by 75 basis
points at their July 20-21 meeting to 11 percent from 10.25
percent, the survey showed.  
 Donadio said he expects policy makers to raise the
benchmark interest rate to 12.25 percent in October, including a
50 basis-point increase that month.  
 “The hike in October will have a strong effect on
inflation expectations, signaling the central bank is not that
influenced by political pressure as some see,” Donadio said.  
 The yield on the interest rate future contract maturing in
January, the most traded on Sao Paulo’s BM&F exchange, fell one
basis point to 11.30 percent at 11:57 a.m. New York time from
11.31 percent on June 18. The real gained 0.4 percent to 1.7643
per dollar.
