             China’s banking regulator has
ordered banks to inspect their lending to industries targeted by
the government as having overcapacity or being highly polluting.  
 Banks must submit their reports to the watchdog by the end
of June, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a
statement distributed at a briefing in Beijing today.  
 Banks must not grant new loans to projects under
construction in industries with overcapacity or that are
polluting that do not comply with government policies, according
to the statement.  
 They must “take measures” to secure repayment of loans
already granted, the CBRC said.
