             Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. ,
the nation’s largest zinc and copper producer, surged the most
in more than a year after China’s move to end the yuan’s fixed
rate to the dollar lifted metal prices.  
 The company’s  shares  climbed as much as 10 percent to
186.80 rupees, the biggest gain since May 18, 2009, and traded
at 185.25 rupees at 12:01 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock was the top
performer today on the  BSE Metal Index . The 15-member gauge rose
as much as 5 percent to 15,555.83, the highest since May 17.  
 Copper jumped as much as 4.6 percent to $6,729.75 a metric
ton on the London Metal Exchange, while zinc added as much as
5.3 percent to $1,821.75 a ton and aluminum rose as much as 3.9
percent to $2,019 a ton after China two days ago signaled an end
to the yuan’s fixed rate to the dollar, a move that may bolster
the country’s purchasing power.  
 “China’s decision to allow flexibility in yuan has given a
boost to metal prices, which is impacting the company shares,”
said  Nikhil Agarwal , an analyst at Kim Eng Securities India Ltd.
in Mumbai. He has a “buy”  rating  on Sterlite’s shares.  
 Hindalco Industriles Ltd. , India’s top aluminum producer,
rose as much as 5 percent to 152.55 rupees, a one-month high.
 Hindustan Zinc Ltd. , a Sterlite unit, climbed 4.9 percent to
1,022 rupees, the most since March 4.  
 Sterlite  in April approved giving holders a bonus share for
every one held and said it would halve the face value to 1 rupee.
The changes, which took effect today, have made the shares more
attractive to investors, said  Alex Mathews , head of research at
Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi.
