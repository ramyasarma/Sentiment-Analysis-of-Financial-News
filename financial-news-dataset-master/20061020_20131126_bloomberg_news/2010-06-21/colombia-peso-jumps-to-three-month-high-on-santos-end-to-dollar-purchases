             Colombia’s peso rose to a three-
month high after former Defense Minister  Juan Manuel Santos  was
elected president in a landslide victory and the central bank
said it will end daily dollar purchases this month.  
 The peso jumped 0.9 percent to 1,893.03 per U.S. dollar at
3:51 p.m. New York time from 1,909.60 on June 18. That’s the
strongest level on a closing basis since March 11. The peso is
up 8 percent this year, the biggest advance among 172 world
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  
 Santos, who studied economics at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the London School of Economics,
won 69 percent of yesterday’s vote against 28 percent for the
Green Party’s  Antanas Mockus . While Banco de la Republica will
end the daily purchases this month, it will continue to evaluate
further market intervention, central bank chief  Jose Dario Uribe 
said on June 18.  
 “The size of the landslide points to a very strong mandate
that will hopefully allow Santos to push labor and fiscal
reforms needed to achieve a primary surplus,” said  Tony Volpon ,
a Latin America strategist for Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York.  
 Santos will take over a government that’s forecast to have
a consolidated budget deficit of 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product, the highest level since 2002. Santos aims to balance
the nation’s budget by 2014,  Juan Carlos Echeverry , his economic
adviser said in a June 10 interview. Santos is likely to choose
Echeverry as finance minister, Bank of America said in a report
today.  
 ‘Upbeat’  
 “We remain upbeat on Colombia’s medium-term prospects,”
 Neil Shearing , senior emerging markets economist at Capital
Economics Ltd in London, wrote in a report today. “There is
still plenty of scope for further catch-up growth and the
investment boom triggered by improvements to domestic security
has longer to run.”  
 As Uribe’s defense minister from 2006 to 2009, Santos
oversaw some of the biggest defeats for the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, including a 2008 raid in Ecuador
that killed the rebel group’s No. 2 leader, Raul Reyes. Uribe’s
security policies helped almost halve the number of murders and
slash kidnappings 93 percent by 2009, spurring economic gains.
The economy grew at its fastest pace in three decades in 2007
and attracted a record $10.6 billion in foreign direct
investment in 2008.  
 The government expects the economy to grow 3 percent this
year and 4 percent in 2011, while forecasting foreign direct
 investment  to reach $10 billion this year.  
 Currency Intervention  
 Policy makers said March 3 the central bank would buy $20
million a day through June 30 to curb a rally they say left the
peso “misaligned.”  
 Economists from Interbolsa SA, the nation’s biggest
brokerage, and Stamford, Connecticut-based RBS Securities Inc.
said in reports last week they expected the central bank to
announce additional dollar purchases after the June 18 monetary
policy meeting.  
 “With still high levels of unemployment (the highest in
the region) and an incipient recovery of economic activity, the
odds of further foreign-exchange intervention remains high,”
RBS currency strategist  Flavia Cattan-Naslausky , wrote in a
report today.  
 The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July
2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.96
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s
price rose 0.034 centavo to 120.522 centavos per peso.
