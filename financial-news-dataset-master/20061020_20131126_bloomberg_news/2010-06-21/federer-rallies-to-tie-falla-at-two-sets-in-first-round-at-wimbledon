             Roger Federer won the fourth set
against Alejandro Falla at the Wimbledon tennis championship
today to tie their first round match at 2-2.  
 The Swiss, seeking to tie Pete Sampras’s Open era men’s
record of seven titles at the All England Club, hasn’t lost in
the first round of a Grand Slam since the French Open seven
years ago.  
 Colombia’s Falla, who failed to take a set off Federer in
their four previous matches, won the opening two sets before
Federer rallied, leaving the match at 7-5, 6-4, 4-6, 6-7 (1-7)
heading into the decider.
