             Telecom Italia SpA  said an Argentine
court annulled some rulings by antitrust regulator CNDC
affecting the company’s business in the country, including
restrictions on exercising rights in Telecom Argentina SA.  
 The appeals court also canceled a decision that suspended
rights to exercise and sell a call option on a stake in Sofora
Telecomunicaciones SA held by the Werthein family, Telecom
Italia said in a stock-exchange statement today. Sofora is the
holding that controls Telecom Argentina.  
 That annulment “does not imply the lifting of the judicial
decisions on the same matters that imposes similar restrictions
on Telecom Italia,” the Italian company said today at the
request of market authorities.
