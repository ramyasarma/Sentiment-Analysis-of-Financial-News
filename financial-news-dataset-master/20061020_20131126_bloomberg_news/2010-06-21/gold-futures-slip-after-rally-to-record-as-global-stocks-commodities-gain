             Gold was little changed after
touching a record high, as rallies in global equities and
industrial raw materials eroded demand for haven assets such as
bullion.  
 The metal reached $1,266.50 an ounce in New York, the
highest price ever, before paring gains. The  MSCI World Index  is
headed for its 10th consecutive increase after China said it
would allow the yuan to strengthen. Gold has climbed 15 percent
this year.  
 “We have counteracting forces that are keeping gold stuck
in the mud,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “Risk is on today, so you’re not
getting flight-to-quality buying. All commodities are rising, so
there’s physical demand for gold from the commodity camp.”  
 Gold futures for August delivery slipped 20 cents to
$1,258.10 an ounce at 9:42 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  
 China ended a two-year peg to the dollar, a move that may
help tame inflation in the world’s third-largest economy. The
 Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of 19 commodities rose as much as
1.2 percent, touching a five-week high, and equities in Asia,
Europe and the U.S. rallied.  
 “As appetite for risk comes back, gold begins to waver,”
said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in
Chicago. “Letting the yuan strengthen is going to take away the
threat of inflation and reduce demand for gold as a hedge.”  
 Record Highs  
 Gold has reached records in euros, sterling and Swiss
francs this year as Europe’s fiscal woes spurred demand for a
haven.  
 “Sovereign-debt worries are going to keep a floor on gold
for the foreseeable future,” Zeman said.  
 Silver futures for July delivery rose 11.1 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $19.295 an ounce on the Comex.  
 Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $20.80, or 1.3
percent, to $1,607.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.  
 Palladium futures for September delivery rose $12.60, or
2.6 percent, to $504 an ounce.
