             The Chinese currency could
appreciate by 3 to 5 percent against the U.S. dollar this year,
Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences said in a printed forum in the China Daily today.  
 The Chinese government will not allow a large increase in
the yuan exchange rate as the currency’s effective exchange rate
against the dollar has risen and the trade surplus is shrinking,
Zhang said in the newspaper. China must watch inflows of foreign
capital to prevent excess liquidity from increasing asset
prices, Zhang said.  
          
          


  
     
       
     
           
                           
                 
                 
                                       
                                   
               
                        
           
                          June 22 (Bloomberg) -- Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Washington-based Economic Strategy Institute and a former Commerce Department international trade official, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about China's shift in currency policy and its implications for the U.S. economy.
     President Barack Obama called China’s decision to increase the flexibility of the exchange rate of the yuan "a constructive step that can help safeguard the recovery and contribute to a more balanced global economy."  (Source: Bloomberg)
