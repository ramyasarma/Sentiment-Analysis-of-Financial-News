             Copper rose the most in a week on
speculation that demand may grow after China, the world’s
biggest metals user, signaled an end to the yuan’s fixed rate
against the dollar.  
 Nickel, aluminum, zinc, lead and tin gained on the London
Metal Exchange after the People’s Bank of China indicated it
will abandon the peg of 6.83 yuan to the dollar. A weaker U.S.
currency makes dollar-priced raw materials cheaper for
importers. Copper futures are up 31 percent in the past year.  
 “A stronger yuan delivers an increase in purchasing power
for Chinese consumers, leading to stronger imports, which might
include base metals, primarily copper and nickel,” said  Michael Jansen , an analyst at JPMorgan Securities Ltd. in London.  
 Copper futures for September delivery rose 5.8 cents, or 2
percent, to $2.9595 a pound on the Comex in New York, the
biggest gain since June 14. On the LME, copper for delivery in
three months climbed $169, or 2.6 percent, to $6,604 a metric
ton, also the most since June 14.  
 Chinese copper imports “remained historically strong”
amid “a strong set of Chinese trade data for May,” Barclays
Capital said today in a report.  
 Daniel Major , an analyst at RBS Global Banking & Markets in
London, downplayed a stronger yuan’s potential effect on
imports. The bank is forecasting a 3 percent rise in the yuan
against the dollar by year-end, he said.  
 “I don’t think a 3 percent appreciation of any currency in
the longer term is going to be the main driver of prices,”
Major said.
