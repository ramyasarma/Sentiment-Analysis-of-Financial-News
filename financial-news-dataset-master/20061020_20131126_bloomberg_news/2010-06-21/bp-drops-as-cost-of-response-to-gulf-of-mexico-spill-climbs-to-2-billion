             BP Plc  fell in London trading after
the company said the cost of its response to the Gulf of Mexico
oil spill, the worst in U.S. history, has accelerated to reach
$2 billion.  
 That’s about $33 million a day, compared with about $30
million reported June 14. BP has  two pipes  collecting oil and
gas from the ocean floor to bring to the surface, and its plan
to upgrade the system with the first floating riser is on
schedule for completion at the end of this month, BP said in a
statement in London today.  
 BP declined 2.2 percent to 349.50 pence in London. The
stock has slumped 47 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig
exploded on April 20.  
 The Obama administration “forced” BP to take more
aggressive steps to deal with the spill, White House Chief of
Staff Rahm Emanuel said yesterday. After BP last week agreed to
set up a $20 billion fund to compensate victims,  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. , a minority partner in the leaking well, said it
will seek to avoid paying claims because BP was “reckless.”  
 BP’s expenses so far include “the cost of the spill
response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf
states, claims paid, and federal costs,” BP said. “It is too
early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities
associated with the incident.”  
 The company says it will be able to stop the flow of oil
from the damaged well with two relief wells it started drilling
in May. The first has reached about 16,000 feet, and the second
has reached 10,000 feet, BP said today. Both are still on track
to be completed three months after their start date, it said.
