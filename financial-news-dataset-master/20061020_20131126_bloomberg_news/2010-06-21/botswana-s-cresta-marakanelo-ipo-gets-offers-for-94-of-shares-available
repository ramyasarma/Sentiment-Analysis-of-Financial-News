             Botswana received bids for 94
percent of the shares on sale in an initial public offering for
Cresta Marakanelo Ltd., a local hotel operator.  
 The Botswana Development Corp., the government investment
company that owns part of Cresta, sold 38.2 million of the 40.7
million shares it had put up for sale, according to a filing
with the Botswana Stock Exchange today. Botswana Development
Corp. will retain the unsold shares, it said.  
 The sale was completed on June 14 and the stock is due to
start trading on the exchange on June 28. It will be the second
new listing on the southern African nation’s bourse this year
after  Wilderness Holdings Ltd ., a safari-camps operator, whose
shares began trading on April 8.  
 The Cresta Marakanelo shares were sold at 1.45 pula each,
raising 55.4 million pula ($8 million) for the Botswana
Development Corp., which previously owned 60 percent of the
hotel operator. TA Holdings Ltd., a Zimbabwe-based investment
company, owns the remaining 40 percent.  
 Botswana Development had planned to reduce its stake to 26
percent. In addition to the 22 percent of Cresta that was
offered in the IPO, the government unit also sold 10 percent of
Cresta to selected institutional investors, and handed 2 percent
to an employee share trust, according to the sale prospectus.
