             Advantest Corp. may report more than
30 billion yen ($329.6 million) in orders in the quarter ending
in June because of DRAM tester sales and factories operating at
full capacity, Nikkei English News reported, citing President
Haruo Matsuno.  
 The company will probably remain profitable this quarter,
Nikkei said.
