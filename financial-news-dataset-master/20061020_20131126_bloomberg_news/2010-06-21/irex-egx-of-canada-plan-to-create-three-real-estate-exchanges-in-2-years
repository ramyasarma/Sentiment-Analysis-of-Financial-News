             IREX of Saudi Arabia and Canada’s
egX World plan to create three real estate exchanges within two
years to provide alternative financing methods for businesses in
the property industry.  
 IREX Group , a venture in Switzerland that will be set up by
the two companies, plans to start with three exchanges in
London, Vancouver and Dubai, Chairman Safar Al Harthi said at a
press conference in Dubai today. Real estate products listed on
the exchange will include real estate investment trusts, debt
securities, property investment units, common and preferred
shares backed by assets and limited partnerships, he said.  
 “IREX will provide retail and institutional investors,
issuers and investment dealers access to this asset class in a
whole new way,” providing financing methods for real estate
developers and a range of property investment options, the
companies said in a statement.  
 Developers in Saudi Arabia have already tried to list 1,645
projects on the exchange, while an additional 20 developers
across the region have expressed interest, Al Harthi said.
Several governments including those of Qatar and Bahrain want to
host IREX’s exchanges, he said.  
 Projects listed will include some that haven’t been started
yet, as well as properties under construction and some that have
already been completed, Al Harthi said.
