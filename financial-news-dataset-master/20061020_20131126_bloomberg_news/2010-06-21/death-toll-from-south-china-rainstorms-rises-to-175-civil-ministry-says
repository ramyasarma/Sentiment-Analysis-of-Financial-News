             The death toll from rainstorms in
southern China rose to 175 as of 11 a.m. local time today, with
107 people missing and 29.7 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) of
economic damage, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said.  
 Flooding from rain that started on June 13 has affected
more than 25 million people in 10 provinces in southern China
and forced 1.71 million people to relocate, the ministry said in
a  statement  posted on its website today.  
 Premier  Wen Jiabao  visited Wuzhou in Guangxi province, one
of the most-affected regions, during the weekend, promising the
government will fight the floods. He urged increased
disbursement of relief funds and materials, and prompt reporting
of damn and reservoir bursts.  
 Strong rainfall will continue in most regions of southern
China, including Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces
for at least three days, the  China Meteorological Administration 
forecast today.  
 The storms have washed out more than 1.36 million hectares
of fields, and 168,000 hectares will have no harvest, the
ministry said. More than 144,000 houses were flattened and
393,000 destroyed it said.
