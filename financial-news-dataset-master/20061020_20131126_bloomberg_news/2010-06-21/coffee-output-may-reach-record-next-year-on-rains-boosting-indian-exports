             Coffee production in India, the
third-biggest grower in Asia, may reach a record next year as
widespread rain in the main growing regions aids crop prospects,
likely increasing shipments to buyers in Europe.  
 Output may total 300,000 to 305,000 metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1, up from 289,600 tons,  Ramesh Rajah , president
of the Coffee Exporters Association of India, said in a phone
interview from Bangalore. The harvest may include 210,000 tons
of robusta, used in instant coffee, compared with 195,000 tons
this year, he said.  
 Record production in India, which exports nearly two-thirds
of its output, may cool a 21 percent rally in robusta coffee
prices in London amid a decline in global inventory of arabica
variety. Arabica coffee had the biggest weekly gain since 2006
last week amid tight supplies and quality problems with the crop
in Brazil, the world’s biggest grower.  
 “India will have a lot more coffee to export next season
and I suspect it’s going to be difficult for robusta prices to
sustain,” said Rajah. Robusta coffee for immediate delivery in
London is trading at a discount to the futures market, he said.  
 Commerzbank AG echoed Rajah’s view in report last week.
Arabica prices may drop to $1.45 a pound by the end of the year
and robusta to $1,450 a ton after the “excessive increase”
since the end of May, the bank said.  
 Robusta for September delivery advanced $20, or 1.3 percent,
to $1,571 a ton on the Liffe Exchange on June 18. Arabica-coffee
for September delivery climbed 2.7 percent to $1.621 a pound in
New York, taking last week’s gain to 11 percent, the most since
Jan. 6, 2006.  
 Excess Rain  
 The southern states of  Karnataka and Kerala , which account
for more than 90 percent of the India’s production, got normal
or excess rainfall since the start of the annual monsoon season
on June 1, according to the weather office.  
 Exports may jump at least 5 percent to 220,000 tons in the
next season, Rajah said. India supplies to countries including
Italy and Russia.  
 “Demand from Europe, by far our biggest market, has been
slackening because of the economic crisis there,” Rajah said.
“The contagion somehow has not hit Italy in a big way, and that
is a big relief.”  
 Shipments  jumped to 187,337 tons between Oct. 1 and June 16,
42 percent more than the 132,328 tons shipped a year earlier,
the state-owned  Coffee Board  said on its website. Sales were
worth $398 million, up from $306.6 million a year ago, it said.  
 India produced a record 301,200 tons of beans in the 2000-
2001 season, according to the board.
