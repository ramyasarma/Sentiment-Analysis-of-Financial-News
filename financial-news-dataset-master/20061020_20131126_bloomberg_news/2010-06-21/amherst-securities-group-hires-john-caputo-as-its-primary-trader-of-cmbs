             Amherst Securities Group LP , the
securities firm that specializes in trading and providing
analysis on mortgage assets, hired  John Caputo  as its primary
trader of commercial mortgage-backed securities.  
 Caputo most recently managed residential- and commercial-
mortgage bond trading at hedge fund C12 Capital Management LP,
and has almost 20 years of commercial real estate experience as
a loan underwriter, desk trader and portfolio manager, Austin,
Texas-based Amherst said today in an e-mailed statement. He’ll
be based in New York.  
 “We are convinced that John’s extensive trading and loan
credit background will be critical to our success as we build
out this important new platform at Amherst,” Amherst Chief
Executive Officer  Sean Dobson  said in the statement.  
 Amherst also hired  Pete Walsh  and  Kevin Gibbons  to lead the
company’s asset-backed securities banking and finance-related
efforts, according to a separate statement. They will oversee
the structuring and closing of mortgage-bond re-securitizations,
as well as the sourcing, structuring and analyzing of non-
mortgage related transactions, Amherst said.
