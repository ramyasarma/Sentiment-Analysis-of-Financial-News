             U.K. stocks rallied to the highest
level in more than a month after China signaled an end to the
yuan’s fixed rate to the dollar, sparking a surge in commodity
producers as metal and oil prices climbed.  
 Kazakhmys Plc, Kazakhstan’s largest copper producer, and
Tullow Oil Plc jumped more than 2 percent as copper advanced the
most in a month in London and crude oil rose to a six-week high.
BP Plc limited gains as costs from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill
accelerated to $2 billion.  
 The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index  climbed 48.27, or 0.9 percent,
to 5,299.11 in London after the People’s Bank of China said on
June 19 it will end a two-year currency peg adopted during the
global financial crisis to protect exporters. The  FTSE All-Share
Index  gained 0.8 percent, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index  advanced
0.1 percent.  
 “Markets have taken this as a sign of confidence that the
global economic recovery is on safe ground,” said London-based
Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG Index. “The move has helped
to allay concerns about further intervention in China to try and
control the rate of economic growth.”  
 Kazakhmys gained 3.4 percent to 1,235 pence, helping to
send a  gauge of mining shares  to a near three-month high.
Vedanta, India’s largest copper producer, increased 6 percent to
2,471 pence and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest
mining company, increased 5 percent to 3,490 pence.  
 Largest Consumer  
 Copper jumped, leading a rally in base metals, amid
speculation that Chinese imports may grow. A weaker U.S.
currency makes dollar-priced metals cheaper for buyers using
other currencies. China is the world’s largest consumer of
copper.  
 Tullow Oil, a British explorer with the most licenses in
Africa, gained 2.3 percent to 1,176 pence as crude oil climbed
above $78 a barrel, extending last week’s 4.6 percent gain.
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe’s largest oil company, increased
1.4 percent to 1,859.5 pence.  
 BP retreated 2.2 percent to 349.5 pence as the company said
the cost of its response to the worst oil spill in U.S. history
accelerated to reach $2 billion.  
 BP is seeking to raise $50 billion to cover the cost of the
oil spill, the Sunday Times said, without saying where it got
the information. The first $10 billion may come from a bond sale
this week and the company is talking to banks to get a $20
billion loan, the newspaper said. The remaining $20 billion
would come from asset sales over two years, it said.  
 “We need to have an unusually strong cash position,”
 Andrew Gowers , head of communications of London-based BP, said
when contacted by phone. He declined to provide more details.  
 The following companies also rose or fell in the U.K and
Irish markets. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  
 Brit Insurance Holdings NV  (BRE LN) gained 19.5 pence, or
2.1 percent, to 944.5 pence. Apollo Global Management LLC will
raise its 770 million-pound ($1.15 billion) offer for the
Lloyd’s of London insurer this week, the Sunday Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  
 Man Group Plc  (EMG LN) increased 6 pence, or 2.4 percent,
to 254.4 after Credit Suisse AG raised its share-price estimate
for the largest publicly traded hedge-fund firm. Credit Suisse
raised its 2011 earnings forecast for the company by 11 percent
and increased its price estimate for the shares by 5.7 percent
to 280 pence.  
 BofA-Merrill Lynch Global Research cut its price objective
for  Man Group’s  shares by 1.4 percent to 355 pence. That’s still
43 percent above last week’s closing price.  
 Shed Media Plc  (SHDP LN) jumped 4.5 pence, or 5.8 percent,
to 82.5. The U.K. TV producer behind Footballers’ Wives and
Supernanny said it is in talks with Time Warner Inc. about a
takeover offer.
