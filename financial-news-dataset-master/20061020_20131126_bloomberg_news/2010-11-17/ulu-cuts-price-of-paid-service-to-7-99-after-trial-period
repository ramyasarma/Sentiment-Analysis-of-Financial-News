Hulu LLC, the video website owned by
three of the biggest U.S. broadcast networks, reduced the price
of its paid service by 20 percent after an initial trial period,
stepping up competition with  Netflix Inc.   The Hulu Plus monthly subscription costs $7.99, the Los
Angeles-based company said today in a statement. The price
during the trial period, announced in June, was $9.99.  Hulu Plus allows subscribers to watch movies and current
and past seasons of television shows such as “Glee” and
“House” on computers, mobile devices and Internet-connected
TVs. The new price goes head-to-head with  Netflix , which began
testing a $7.99-a-month online streaming-only service in the
U.S. last month. Netflix had been offering streaming programs
and DVD rentals by mail for as low as $8.99.  Programs on Hulu and Hulu Plus are primarily from owners
ABC, Fox and NBC. Users who subscribed during Hulu Plus’s $9.99-
a-month preview period will receive a credit toward their next
billing cycle, the company said today. New subscribers will get
a one-week free trial.  Previously, Hulu offered a smaller selection of shows and
episodes for free and depended solely on advertising revenue.
The closely held company still offers a free version that
provides some movies and the five most-recent episodes of shows
such as “Family Guy.”  Hulu was founded in 2007 by  General Electric Co. ’s NBC
Universal and  News Corp. ’s Fox.  Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC
and private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners Inc. are also
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
