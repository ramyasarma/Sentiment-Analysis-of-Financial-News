Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average is
on the verge of surging by more than 50 percent as long-term 
equity and currency cycles converge for the first time,  
according to a review of price patterns by Japan’s second-ranked 
chart analyst.  The gauge may rise by 55 percent to 15,200 by mid-2012 from
its last close of 9,811.66 if it bottoms between now and
February, said  Yutaka Yoshino , chief technical analyst at Tokyo-
based Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. Two stock-market cycles of
12 years and 60 years are about to converge with an 11-year
currency trend, he said. The yen is set to peak against the
dollar before losing almost half its value, he said.  “A great transformation may begin as early as January,”
Yoshino, ranked No. 2 among Japanese technical analysts by the
Nikkei newspaper last year, said in an interview. “It may
become the best buying opportunity in several decades. November
signals an important period for markets around the world. I’m
extremely excited.”  Technical analysts study trading patterns to predict price
changes. Yoshino based his market forecasts on what he said is
the convergence of a Nikkei 225 cycle that began in October 1998
and lasts an average of 145 months and a 133-month yen-dollar
trend that began in November 1999.  He also considered a 60-year cycle in equities beginning
1890 and derived using the so-called Fisher Formula Index,
compiled by an economist in the 1970s. The  Nikkei Stock  Average
has been calculated since  1950  -- the end of Yoshino’s first
six-decade cycle -- when a new 60-year pattern began. That cycle
is now ending.  Peaks And Troughs  “The longer the cycle, fewer people really observe them,”
said Yoshino. Short-term cycles that only go back as far as one
year can be easily disrupted when market participants act
preemptively, Yoshino said.  Relative peaks and troughs in prices mark the beginnings
and endings of cycles in Yoshino’s analysis. In the final stages
of the Nikkei’s 12-year cycle, the Japanese economy typically
slows, the yen strengthens and the stock market declines,
according to Yoshino. If that continues into late the following
year, the market has usually completed its drop and is about to
rebound, he said.  The  Nikkei  ended its last 12-year cycle in 1998 as Asian
currency devaluations sent the gauge tumbling. It began the next
cycle, which is ending now, by surging through to April 2000 in
the final two years of a bubble in information-technology shares.  This month marks the end of the dollar-yen rate’s 133-month
cycle, according to Yoshino’s chart. The yen may strengthen to a
record of about 73.82 to the dollar in coming months from about
83 now, before retreating by 67 yen.  “The period of years with a strong yen and 20 years with
a weak stock market is about to end,” Yoshino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
