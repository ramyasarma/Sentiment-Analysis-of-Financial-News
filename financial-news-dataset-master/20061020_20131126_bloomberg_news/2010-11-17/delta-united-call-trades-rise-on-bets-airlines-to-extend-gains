Trading of bullish  Delta Air Lines
Inc.  and  United Continental Holdings Inc.  options jumped to at
least triple the four-week average as investors boosted bets
that the carriers will extend their rallies this year.  More than 63,000 calls to buy Delta shares changed hands,
117 times the number of puts to sell, while the stock rose 0.5
percent to $13.21 as of 4 p.m. in New York. United call volume
rose to 27,244 and was 17 times higher than put volume as the
shares gained 0.6 percent to $27.34.  Delta, the world’s second-biggest carrier, has risen 16
percent this year while larger rival United, formed in a merger
last month of United’s parent and Continental Airlines Inc.,
more than doubled.  Airplanes are flying at their fullest since World War II,
helping carriers boost fares and report two consecutive
quarterly profits as a group for the first time since 2007.
Twenty-four million people are expected to travel by air for the
12-day Thanksgiving holiday period that starts Nov. 19. That’s
up 3.5 percent from a year ago.  Delta said in a Nov. 15 regulatory filing that it plans to
sell $474.1 million of airplane-backed debt due May 2019 to
refinance payments on Boeing Co. and Airbus aircraft.
Continental Airlines, which merged with United Airlines parent
UAL Corp. last month, sold $427.2 million of debt today also
backed by planes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Delta also said yesterday it would add twice-weekly service
between Atlanta and Shanghai in June and five flights a week
from Detroit to Beijing in July, subject to government approval.
The additions take advantage of a resurgence in Asian travel
demand, fueled by economic growth in China and new access for
U.S. carriers to Haneda airport near downtown Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
