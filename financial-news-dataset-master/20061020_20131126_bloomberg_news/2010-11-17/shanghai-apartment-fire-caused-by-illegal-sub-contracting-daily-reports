A high-rise apartment building fire
in central Shanghai Monday was caused by illegal multiple sub-
contracting and poor government supervision, the Shanghai Daily
reported, citing Luo Lin, director of State Administration of
Work Safety and the head of the investigation group.  Two unlicensed welders, who were among the eight people
detained, were alleged to have accidentally started the fire,
the report said. The blaze, which killed 53 people, may have
been started by sparks from welding tools, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
