     Feb. 14 (Bloomberg) -  Immofinanz AG , an Austrian property
developer, is offering a  bond issue  that will be convertible
into as many as 125 million shares to refinance two outstanding
convertible bonds.  Immofinanz shareholders can order three bonds convertible
into one share each for every 23 shares they own, Vienna-based
Immofinanz said in a statement today. The subscription period
starts Feb. 16 and is due to end March 2. Pricing is to be
determined on March 3 after bonds not ordered by shareholders
have been offered to outside investors. The price on the bonds,
due March 2018, won’t exceed 5.50 euros, capping the total
volume at 687.5 million euros. Immofinanz closed at 3.27 euros
in Vienna trading today.  At the same time, Immofinanz is offering to buy back
convertible bonds due 2014 and 2017. It is offering to pay 99.75
percent of face value for each 2014 bond and 106 percent of face
value for each 2017 bond, according to the statement. Their
outstanding principal is 773 million euros. The volume of the
buyback is limited by the amount raised in the sale of the new
bond, Immofinanz said. The bonds can be tendered from tomorrow
until March 7.  Immofinanz plans to use as many as 104 million treasury
shares to service the convertible bond, it said Feb. 11.  Credit Suisse Group AG is the sole global coordinator for
the bond sale, and Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG and UniCredit
Bank Austria AG are joint bookrunners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
