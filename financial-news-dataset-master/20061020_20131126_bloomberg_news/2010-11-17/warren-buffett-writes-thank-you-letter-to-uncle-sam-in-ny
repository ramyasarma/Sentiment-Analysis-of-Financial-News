Billionaire investor Warren Buffett 
wrote an open “thank-you” letter in today’s New York Times,
saying the U.S. government’s intervention in the financial
crisis had stopped many companies from going under, saved
millions of jobs and restored calm.  He singled out Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ,
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner  and his predecessor, Hank Paulson , and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair  for praise; he added that although he’d never voted for
President George W. Bush , he gave him credit for acting as
Congress dithered.  The U.S., he wrote, had been gripped by a “mass delusion”
that house prices would never fall significantly - “delusions
produce bubbles...this bubble was a doozy and its pop felt
around the world,” Buffett added.  Buffett wrote that often the government was wasteful,
bullying, and sometimes “downright maddening. But in this
extraordinary emergency, you came through - and the world would
look far different now if you had not.”  He signed the missive “Your grateful nephew, Warren.”  (Click here for link to story.)  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
