Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
added 1.2 percent to 20,880.38 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following companies either rose or fell in Italian
trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Eni SpA  (ENI IM) climbed 1.2 percent to 16.31 euros. UBS AG
reiterated a “buy” recommendation on Italy’s biggest oil
company, citing an “unwarranted discount valuation.”  Fiat SpA  (F IM) gained 3.5 percent to 13.52 euros. Chrysler
Group LLC, which is bringing the Fiat brand back to the U.S.
after almost 30 years, expects 60 percent of customers to pre-
order versions of the Fiat 500 when it reaches showrooms in the
first quarter of 2011.  Separately, Citigroup Inc. raised its price estimate on the
stock of Italy’s largest manufacturer to 16 euros per share from
15 euros.  General Motors Co. of the U.S., which went bankrupt last
year after almost a century on the New York Stock Exchange,
advanced as much as 9.1 percent in its return to public trading
following a $20 billion initial public offering.  Finmeccanica SpA  (FNC IM) dropped 1.3 percent to 9.01
euros, a third decline. Italy’s biggest defense company was cut
to “reduce” from “accumulate” at Banca Akros after
Finmeccanica hosted an investors day.  The company’s “3-year budget plan is very cautious,”
Banca Akros wrote in a note. “The focus is on cost and
investment cutting; margins are going to remain basically
unchanged, while it is not yet clear how much the cash flow will
improve.”  Finmeccanica expects restructuring costs of as much as 189
million euros ($258 million) through 2013, Milan-based broker
Equita Sim said in a note today.  Gruppo Coin SpA  (GCN IM) gained 6.3 percent to 7.75 euros
for the biggest two-day gain since July. The Italian clothing
distributor forecast sales will climb 37 percent in the current
fiscal year.  Hera SpA  (HER IM) advanced 1.8 percent to 1.46 euros. The
Italian utility agreed to buy a stake of as much as 49 percent
in La Spezia utility Acam SpA as a first step toward a merger by
the end of 2012.       Tenaris SA  (TEN IM) rose 1.5 percent to 16.41 euros.
Barclays Capital rated the shares “overweight” in new
coverage.  “We believe Tenaris is a good way to invest in the
international exploration and production spending upcycle that
has recently begun and the global expansion in offshore
deepwater drilling,” analysts at the London-based bank wrote in
a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
