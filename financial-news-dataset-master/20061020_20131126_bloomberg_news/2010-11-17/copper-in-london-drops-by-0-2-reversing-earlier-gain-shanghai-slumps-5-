Copper in London dropped 0.2 percent
to $8,132.75 a metric ton, reversing an earlier gain of as much
as 0.5 percent. The three-month contract on the London Metal
Exchange dropped 5.7 percent yesterday on concern Chinese
measures to cool the economy may damp demand for raw materials.  The metal tumbled by the daily 5 percent limit to 61,550
yuan a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
