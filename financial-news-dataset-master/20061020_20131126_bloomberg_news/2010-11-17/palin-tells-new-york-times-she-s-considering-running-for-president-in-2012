Former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin 
is considering running for president in 2012, the New York Times
reported, citing an interview with the 2008 Republican vice-
presidential nominee.  Palin, 46, told the newspaper that she was “having that
discussion” with her family and her decision would rest, in
part, on what qualities she would bring to the race.  She endorsed more than 80 candidates in the 2010 elections,
and at least 50 of them won, the newspaper said. She also raised
more than $10 million for Republican candidates and the party,
the newspaper said.  Her political action committee raised $2.5 million between
Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 and contributed $190,500 to candidates and
Republican political committees, Federal Election Commission
filings show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
