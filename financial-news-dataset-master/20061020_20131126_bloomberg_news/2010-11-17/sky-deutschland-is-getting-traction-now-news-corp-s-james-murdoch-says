Sky Deutschland AG, the pay-
television operator 49.9 percent-owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News
Corp., is getting “traction,” James Murdoch, News Corp.’s
chairman and chief executive officer for Europe and Asia, said
at a Morgan Stanley conference in Barcelona today.   Some European pay-TV markets can be a “bit messy” at the
beginning, James Murdoch said, adding that News Corp. is still
“very excited” about Sky Deutschland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
