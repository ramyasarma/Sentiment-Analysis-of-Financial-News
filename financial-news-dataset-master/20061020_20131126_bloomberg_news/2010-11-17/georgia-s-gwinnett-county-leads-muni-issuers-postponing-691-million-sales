Georgia’s Gwinnett County Water and
Sewerage Authority postponed a $181 million municipal debt sale,
the biggest of 14 competitive offerings this week delayed or
incomplete because of the flood of issuance pushing up yields.  Yields on top-rated tax-exempts due in 10 years jumped 23
basis points yesterday, the biggest one-day move since March
2009. They  climbed to 2.98 percent , a five-month high, according
to a Bloomberg Valuation index. Yields rose on every maturity,
BVAL indexes show.  Twenty-year rates  reached the highest since
Sept. 2, 2009, after climbing for a fourth straight day. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Planned offerings totaling about $754 million weren’t
priced this week, about 33 percent of the $2.3 billion in
unfinished deals this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The figure includes issues that were postponed,
received no bids or had bids rejected.  “Bids came in 30 basis points higher than what we had
estimated, and the savings were obliterated,” said  Michael McDonald  of Atlanta’s  Public Financial Management , which was the
adviser on the Gwinnett deal. “We’re planning on putting it
back on the calendar when the market turns.”  Orange County  States and municipalities planned about $15.4 billion in
sales this week, the most in more than  seven years , Bloomberg
data show. The 30-day scheduled supply reached  $26.3 million  on
Nov. 16, the highest since Feb. 18, 2005, Bloomberg data show.  California’s Orange County Sanitation District, top-rated
by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, put off a $157 million
Build America Bond issue because of the oversupply, according to
Lorenzo Tyner, director of finance.  Holders sought bids for  $1.3 billion  in muni bonds on Nov.
15, the highest since Dec. 9, 2008, according to a daily bids-
wanted index compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market’s been pretty volatile, with a lot of
issues,” Tyner said. “We’ll see what the market looks like
next week.”  The Build America program, which subsidizes 35 percent of
issuer interest costs, is set to expire Dec. 31. Tyner said he
wants to complete the sale before then.  Also postponed this week was an $840 million sale from the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The postponement
wasn’t market-related, according to  Steve Coleman , a spokesman
for the authority. The sale was delayed amid issues regarding
bond insurance from  MBIA Inc. , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
