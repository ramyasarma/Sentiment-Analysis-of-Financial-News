New Zealand Agriculture Minister
David Carter said a kiwifruit vine disease first discovered in
the Bay of Plenty region on the nation’s North Island has been
found in parts of the South Island.  Two orchards in the Nelson and Golden Bay region tested
positive for the infection, Carter told reporters in Wellington
today. A total of 28 sites across the country have the disease,
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
