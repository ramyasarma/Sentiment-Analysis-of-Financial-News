The City Council in Los Angeles,
America’s second-largest metropolis, agreed to ask voters to
slap a 5 percent tax on medical marijuana next year.  If passed, the measure on the March 8 municipal  ballot  may
raise as much as $7 million a year for the city, according to
Courtney Chesla, a spokeswoman for  Janice Hahn , the council
member who sponsored the resolution, which passed 10-4 today.  “We’re in desperate need of revenue and we shouldn’t miss
this opportunity,”  Paul Koretz , another council member, said
before the vote. The tax would be applied to reimbursements
received by dispensaries of the drug.  Los Angeles, which closed a $492 million budget deficit for
the fiscal year that began July 1, joins other California cities
including Long Beach and Berkeley in pursuing pot taxes. Use of
marijuana for medicinal purposes was passed by California voters
in 1996.  To contact the reporters on this story:
