Gold imports this year by India, the
largest consumer, have already exceeded 2009 levels as consumers
boost jewelry purchases, according to the World Gold Council.  Imports totaled 624 metric tons by the end of the third
quarter, compared with 559 tons in all of 2009, according to
data released in a report by the London-based industry group
today. India bought 214 tons in the third quarter, up from 176
tons a year earlier, it said.  Jewelry demand in India surged 36 percent in the third
quarter even as gold prices gained, the council said. Bullion
futures in New York reached a record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9 and are
up 22 percent this year.  “Given the dual purpose of Indian jewelry, as both an
adornment and an investment, the rising price helped to support
demand for jewelry,” the council said in the report.
“Furthermore, consumers have adjusted their price expectations
and are anticipating yet higher prices.”  Consumers in India purchased 184.5 tons of gold in the
third-quarter for jewelry, up from 135.2 tons a year ago, the
report said. Total gold demand in India rose 28 percent in the
period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
