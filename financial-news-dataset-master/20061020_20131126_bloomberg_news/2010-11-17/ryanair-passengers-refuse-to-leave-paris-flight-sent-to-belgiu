Ryanair Holdings Plc  passengers
refused to leave a plane that was diverted from Paris to Liege
in Belgium, 175 miles (280 kilometers) away, because of poor
weather conditions.  Customers on the flight from Fez in Morocco ignored crew
requests to disembark after the Boeing Co. 737-800 was diverted
from Beauvais airport north of the French capital because of
fog, Europe’s biggest discount airline said today.  Crew left the aircraft and the toilets were locked and
lights switched off when some travelers became disruptive, Chief
Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  said at a press conference in
Dublin, where Ryanair is based. Passengers disembarked and were
taken to Beauvais by bus when airport police became involved.  Customers on three other Ryanair flights that were diverted
to Liege completed their journeys to France without incident.  “It is standard safety procedure for all airlines to divert
to another airport when weather closes a destination airport,
and it is standard procedure to coach passengers to their
destination,” Ryanair said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
