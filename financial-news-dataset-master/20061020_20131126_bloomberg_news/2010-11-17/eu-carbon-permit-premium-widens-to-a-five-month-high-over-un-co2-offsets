The premium of European Union carbon
permits for 2012 over United Nations offsets advanced to its
widest level since June 9 as EU lawmakers consider banning
credits from some industrial-gas cutting projects in 2013.  The spread between EU permits and UN credits for 2012,
traded as a separate contract, widened 4 cents, or 1 percent, to
4.12 euros ($5.58) a metric ton as of 5:33 p.m. on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  EU carbon permits for December this year rose 1.7 percent
to 14.88 euros a ton on ICE. UN CERs for December this year,
which include credits from potentially banned industrial-gas
projects, rose 2 percent to 12.26 euros a ton. German power for
next year, which sometimes tracks carbon permits, advanced 0.8
percent to 48.55 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
