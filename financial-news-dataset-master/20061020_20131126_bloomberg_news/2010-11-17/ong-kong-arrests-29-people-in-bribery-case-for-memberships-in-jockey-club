Twenty-nine people were arrested for
suspected bribery related to applications for membership in the
 Hong Kong Jockey Club , the city’s Independent Commission Against
Corruption said today.  Three voting members of the club, which operates Hong
Kong’s horse races and lottery and donates proceeds to
charitable causes, are accused of taking payoffs from applicants
to support their bid to join, the anti-graft agency said in a
 statement  on its website.  The investigation, code-named “Pilot,” led to arrests of
the voting members and an unspecified number of non-voting
members, middlemen and people seeking to join, the ICAC said.  The Jockey Club is cooperating with the probe, the
statement said.  Earlier this year former Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. director
John Terence Hung lost an appeal of his conviction for taking
bribes to support a Jockey Club membership application, Radio
Television Hong Kong reported June 30.  The two cases are unrelated, ICAC spokesman  Alan Tse  said
by telephone today.  Editors: Dirk Beveridge, Douglas Wong  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
