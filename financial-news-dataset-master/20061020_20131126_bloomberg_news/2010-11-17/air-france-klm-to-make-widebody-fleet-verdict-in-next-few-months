Air France-KLM Group  may reach a
decision on an order for 100 Boeing Co. or Airbus SAS widebody
planes before the end of the year, Chief Financial Officer
 Philippe Calavia  said today.  Europe’s biggest airline, which is evaluating  Boeing ’s 787
Dreamliner and the rival  Airbus  A350, plans to take the aircraft
from 2016 for delivery over five to 10 years, Calavia said in an
interview in Paris following an earnings presentation.  A decision is needed within the next few months and may be
reached by Dec. 31, the CFO said. About three-quarters of the
aircraft are required to replace older planes, with the other
quarter representing an increase in capacity, he said. Air
France-KLM hasn’t ruled out taking a mix of 787s and A350s.  The company is meanwhile postponing the planned retirement
of 13 of its long-haul jets beyond 2012. The last of the Boeing
MD-11s at Dutch unit KLM and the 747 jumbos operated by Air
France will now be stood down in 2016, Chief Executive Officer
 Pierre -Henri Gourgeon said in the presentation.  The aircraft are due to be replaced by 777-300 twin-jets
from Boeing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
