Portugal’s borrowing costs increased
at an auction of 750 million euros ($1.01 billion) of 12-month
bills and demand fell as Europe’s fiscal crisis weighed on
investors.  The securities, due Nov. 18, 2011, were issued today at an
average yield of 4.813 percent, the country’s debt management
agency said. That compares with an average yield of 3.26 percent
at a previous sale of 12-month bills on Nov. 3. The auction
attracted bids for 1.8 times the amount offered, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.2 on Nov. 3. The agency had set an
indicative amount of 750 million euros for the auction.  “This increase in yield was very accentuated and
surprising because the market was pointing at figures in the
order of 4.3 percent or 4.4 percent,”  Filipe Silva , who manages
60 million euros, including Portuguese bonds, at Banco Carregosa
SA in Oporto, Portugal, said in an e-mailed note. “Demand also
fell quite a lot.”  Concern that governments may struggle to cut budget
shortfalls and curb debt has pushed up borrowing costs for
Portugal and other high-deficit European countries this year.
Portugal had the euro region’s fourth-largest budget gap in
2009, behind Greece, Ireland and Spain.  Irish Review  European Union and International Monetary Fund experts will
start scanning the books of Ireland’s debt-laden banks tomorrow
in a prelude to a possible aid package to stem Europe’s widening
fiscal crisis. Finance chiefs from the 16-country euro area said
the joint assessment will determine whether Ireland can patch up
the banking system on its own or needs to fall back on the EU-
IMF 750 billion-euro rescue fund.  Portugal can continue to finance itself “in the markets,”
Finance Minister Fernando  Teixeira dos Santos  said on Nov. 15.  The spread on Portugal’s 10-year bonds over German bunds
was at 410 basis points today, after hitting a euro-era record
of 484 basis points on Nov. 11. The spread between Irish and
German 10-year bonds widened to 568 basis points today. Ireland
is fully funded until the middle of next year.  Portugal has already issued more than 93 percent of its
2010 funding needs,  Alberto Soares , president of Portugal’s
government debt agency, said on Nov. 8. On Nov. 10, borrowing
costs on longer-term debt also increased as Portugal sold 1.24
billion euros of bonds, the last bond sale for this year.  Budget Plan  The budget plan for 2011 received preliminary approval in
parliament this month as the minority Socialist government tries
to cut a deficit that reached 9.3 percent of gross domestic
product in 2009. It aims to lower the  shortfall  to 7.3 percent
this year, 4.6 percent in 2011 and meet the EU’s 3 percent limit
in 2012.  The planned spending cuts for next year are set to be the
biggest since at least 1978, according to EU statistics office
Eurostat, as the government tries to convince investors it can
narrow its budget deficit and curb debt. The austerity measures
may hurt Portugal’s  economic growth , which has averaged less
than 1 percent a year in the past decade.  The government is counting on exports such as paper and
wood products to support expansion. The budget forecasts GDP
growth of 0.2 percent in 2011, slower than this year’s estimated
1.3 percent pace.  Portugal’s  unemployment rate  rose to 10.9 percent in the
third quarter from 10.6 percent in the second quarter, the
National Statistics Institute said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
