Most U.S.  stocks  rose, snapping a
four-day losing streak in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index , as
earnings at Target Corp. and speculation that Ireland will
receive aid offset concern that technology spending is slowing.  Target  climbed 3.4 percent as profit jumped 23 percent on
credit-card unit growth.  McDonald’s Corp.  gained 1.2 percent,
helping give consumer shares the biggest gain among 10
industries in the S&P 500.  NetApp Inc.  tumbled 6.5 percent after
the maker of storage equipment joined Cisco Systems Inc. in
giving a forecast that spurred concern corporations are spending
less on computer gear.  The  S&P 500  added less than a point to 1,178.59 at 4 p.m.
in New York, after earlier rising 0.3 percent. The 30-stock Dow
Jones Industrial Average declined 15.62, or 0.1 percent, to
11,007.88. About five stocks advanced for every four that fell
on U.S. exchanges, according to Bloomberg data.  “The markets are vulnerable,” said  John Carey , a Boston-
based money manager a Pioneer Investments, which oversees about
$250 billion. “People are a little more relaxed about the
European sovereign situation today as compared to yesterday.
However, until, we get more clarity on that and the outlook for
Chinese monetary policy, I expect heightened fluctuations with
investors reacting to any piece of news.”  The S&P 500 has  dropped  3.3 percent since Nov. 11, after
Cisco’s disappointing forecast for profit and revenue
underscored government-spending cutbacks in Europe, Japan and
the U.S., posing risks for companies that rely on the sector for
growth.  Inflation, Housing Starts  Stock futures held their advance this morning as the
consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent
rise the prior month, the Labor Department said today in
Washington. A 0.3 percent gain was forecast by economists,
according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.
Excluding food and fuel, so-called core costs increased 0.6
percent from October 2009, the smallest gain on record.  A separate report showed housing starts fell to a 519,000
annual rate, the fewest since a record low reached in April 2009
and down 12 percent from a revised 588,000 in September that was
less than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said.  “Both data are consistent with what the Fed has been
saying,” said  Stephen Wood , the New York-based chief market
strategist for Russell Investments, which manages $140 billion.
“It doesn’t give investors reason to question the policy.”  ‘Thank You’  Warren Buffett , the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
wrote an open “thank-you” letter in today’s New York Times,
saying the U.S. government’s intervention in the financial
crisis had stopped many companies from going under, saved
millions of jobs and restored calm.  Separately, in a CNBC interview, Buffett said the current
government spending can be considered stimulus. He also said the
economy will be “far ahead of where we are now in four to five
years,” and that the U.S. needs to get the deficit down to
“not more than 3% of GDP.”  The  MSCI World Index  rose for the first time in eight days
as European Union and International Monetary Fund experts will
start scanning the books of Ireland’s debt-laden banks tomorrow
in a prelude to a possible aid package to stem Europe’s widening
fiscal crisis. Finance chiefs from the 16-country euro area said
the assessment will determine whether Ireland can patch up the
banking system on its own or needs to fall back on the EU-IMF
750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) rescue fund.  Consumer Companies  A measure of companies that rely on  consumer discretionary 
spending rose 0.7 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P 500 among
10 industries.  Target  climbed 3.9 percent to $55.62. Net income rose to
$535 million, or 74 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct.
30, from $436 million, or 58 cents, a year earlier. Excluding a
tax gain, profit was 68 cents a share, matching the average of
20 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, had the
biggest gain in the Dow, rising 1.2 percent to $78.37.   Merck & Co.  advanced 1.1 percent to $34.47. The company’s
experimental drug, anacetrapib, raised levels of good
cholesterol and lowered bad cholesterol. It also may have helped
patients avert heart complications without the safety risks that
prompted Pfizer Inc. to abandon a similar product four years ago,
according to a study funded by Merck.  Estimates Raised  Analysts are raising their estimates of 2011 revenue at S&P
500 companies for the first time in six months, encouraging
investors betting that stocks will rally.  Sales will climb 5.7 percent to $1,014.08 a share next year,
according to the average estimate as of Nov. 15. The forecast
had fallen every month since May, when it rose to a 2010 high of
$1,034.24 a share. The projected growth rate is 1.8 percentage
points higher than the average since 1993, Bloomberg data show.  NetApp slumped as much as 7.8 percent, before trading was
halted. Excluding some costs, earnings will be 48 cents to 50
cents this quarter, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said
on its website. Analysts had projected 51 cents, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The reaction to NetApp’s estimate is more of a contagion
of what we saw starting with Cisco’s warning last week,” said
 Dave Lutz , managing director of equity trading at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore. “A lot of the higher-end storage
companies are rolling over on that.”  Homebuilders  The  S&P 500 Supercomposite Homebuilding Index  slumped 1.2
percent, as 9 of its 12 members declined, as housing starts
dropped more than forecast. D.R. Horton Inc. fell 3.1 percent to
$10.68. PulteGroup Inc. slumped 2.2 percent to $6.74.  Regions Financial Corp.  dropped 6.4 percent to $5.54.
Alabama’s biggest bank had its credit rating cut for the second
time this month by Moody’s Investors Service after the lender
ousted three managers who oversaw risk and souring assets. The
firm’s senior debt rating was lowered two levels to Ba3 from Ba1,
Moody’s said in a statement late yesterday.  Solar shares declined after Credit Suisse Group AG reduced
the industry’s recommendation to “market weight” from
“overweight,” saying subsidy-driven demand can’t keep up with
surging supply. First Solar Inc. lost 6 percent to $122.83, the
third-biggest drop in the S&P 500.    Suntech Power Holdings Co.  slid 9.7 percent to $7.53.
China’s largest solar panel maker reported net income for the
third quarter of $33.1 million, or 18 cents per American
depositary receipt. That’s lower than the 23-cent average
estimate of 21 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
