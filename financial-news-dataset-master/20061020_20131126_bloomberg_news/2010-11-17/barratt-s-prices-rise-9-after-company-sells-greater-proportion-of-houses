Barratt Developments Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest homebuilder by volume, said its average selling price
rose by about 9 percent to 180,000 pounds ($286,000) since July
as the company built a greater proportion of houses compared
with apartments.  Total forward sales, or houses paid for but not yet built,
were similar to last year at 870.9 million pounds, London-based
Barratt said today in a statement. Net debt should increase to
400 million pounds to 450 million pounds by the end of June
2011, the company said. Barratt said in September that net debt
was 366.9 million pounds.  “We’re being hit quite hard by macro factors,” Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Clare  said on a conference call. “All we
can do is focus on improving our profit margins. If we focus on
share price, we’re losing the plot.” Barratt has slumped 40
percent in London trading this year, more than any other U.K.
housebuilder.  The U.K. government’s plan to cut nearly 500,000 jobs to
bring down its record deficit resulted in weaker sales in the
period than usual, Clare said. A lack of mortgage availability
remains the biggest headwind to the industry, he said.  Houses should make up 65 percent of the homes sold during
this fiscal year, up from about 60 percent, the company said.
The increase in prices and recent purchases of cheap land should
drive up profit margins, Barratt said.  Barratt gained 1.5 percent to 75 pence as of 8:54 a.m. The
stock changed hands at about 180 pence after a rights offer to
raise about 700 million pounds was announced in September 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
