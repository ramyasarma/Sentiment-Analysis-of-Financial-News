U.S. stock futures held their
advance as data on inflation and housing starts trailed
estimates.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
to 1,178.6 at 8:40 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures rose 0.2 percent, while Nasdaq 100 Index futures
climbed 0.4 percent.  The consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent after a 0.1
percent rise the prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington. A 0.3 percent gain was forecast by economists,
according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.
Excluding food and fuel, so-called core costs increased 0.6
percent from October 2009, the smallest gain on record.  A separate report showed housing starts fell to a 519,000
annual rate, the fewest since a record low reached in April 2009
and down 12 percent from a revised 588,000 in September that was
less than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures
showed today in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
