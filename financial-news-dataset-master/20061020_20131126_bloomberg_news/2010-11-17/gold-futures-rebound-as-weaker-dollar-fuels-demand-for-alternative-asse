in two weeks as a weaker dollar boosted demand for the precious

9, partly on concern that the Federal Reserve’s program to buy
back bonds will erode the dollar.  “Gold is still very well-bid on the breaks,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in
Chicago. “A weaker dollar is helping gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $2.30, or 0.2

mailed report.  Demand for gold rose 12 percent in the third quarter, led
by a 36 percent increase in jewelry buying from India, the World
Gold Council said today in a report. Overall Indian demand rose
28 percent as consumers purchased 184.5 metric tons for jewelry
and 45 tons in bars and coins, accounting for 30 percent of
total world purchases, according to the report. China was the
second-biggest buyer in the period, purchasing 153.7 tons.  “Emerging markets continue to lead demand,” said Eily
Ong, an investment research manager for the council in London.
“We see rising income levels and consumers who have a higher
savings rate. They want to lock in their wealth in an asset that
has the preservation properties of gold.”  Silver, Palladium Gain  Silver futures for December delivery rose 52.2 cents, or
