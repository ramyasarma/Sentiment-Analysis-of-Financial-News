The dollar retreated from a seven-
week high versus euro before reports forecast to show U.S.
inflation was contained and housing starts dropped to a three-
month low.  The dollar was near a six-week high against the yen after
Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart said
additional bond purchases by the central bank aren’t intended to
weaken the greenback. The Australian and New Zealand dollars
traded near the lowest in more than two weeks as declines in
stocks and concerns China will take measures to cool inflation
damped demand for higher-yielding assets. The euro snapped a
two-day slide against the yen.  “Employment and housing haven’t recovered much at all,”
said  Tetsuya Inoue , chief researcher for financial markets at
Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s largest
brokerage. “Weak credit conditions in the U.S. may prompt
people to invest money abroad. As a result, the dollar will be
under downward pressure.”  The dollar fell to $1.3513 per euro as of 1:52 p.m. in
Tokyo from $1.3489 in New York yesterday, when it touched
$1.3448, the highest level since Sept. 28. The shared currency
rose to 112.72 yen from 112.38 yen. The greenback traded at
83.41 yen from 83.29 yen. Yesterday, it reached 83.59 yen, the
highest level since Oct. 5.  Inflation, Housing  U.S. consumer prices, excluding food and fuel costs, rose
0.7 percent in October from a year ago after gaining 0.8 percent
in September, according to the median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey before today’s data. Housing starts grew
at a 598,000 annual rate last month, the least since July and
down from a 610,000 rate in September, another survey showed.  The euro gained against the yen as the common currency
climbed above the so-called cloud of the daily ichimoku chart
after entering it yesterday.  Ichimoku analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist, is
used to predict a currency’s direction through analyzing the
midpoints of historical highs and lows.  Gains in the euro were limited amid concern a failure to
craft a rescue package for Ireland will allow the nation’s
banking crisis to spread.  Ireland is negotiating with the European Union  and
International Monetary Fund about aid to shore up the state’s
finances, furnish capital for the country’s banks and spare it
from tapping the bond market for an extended period, a European
official said on condition of anonymity.  Australia’s currency was at 97.64 U.S. cents from 97.67
cents. New Zealand’s dollar was at 76.67 cents from 76.78 cents.
The so-called kiwi reached 76.53 cents yesterday, the lowest
since from Nov. 2.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares fell 0.6
percent. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
declined 3.2 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
