Ireland led an increase in the cost
of insuring European government debt as finance ministers
stopped short of an immediate bailout package and LCH Clearnet
Ltd. raised the margin requirement for Irish bond trading.  Credit-default swaps on Ireland jumped 35 basis points to
554.5, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Greece
increased 22 basis points to 950, Portugal rose 7 to 429, Italy
was 6 higher at 192 and Spain was up 9.5 at 266.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 2 basis points to 170. A basis point on a
credit-default swap contract protecting $10 million of debt from
default for five years is equivalent to $1,000 a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  The cost of insuring against losses on European corporate
bonds fell, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit iTraxx
Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit
ratings declined 3 basis points to 470. The Markit iTraxx Europe
Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings decreased
0.5 basis point to 103.75.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers fell 1 basis point to 135.5 and the
subordinated index was 1.5 lower at 214.5, JPMorgan prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
