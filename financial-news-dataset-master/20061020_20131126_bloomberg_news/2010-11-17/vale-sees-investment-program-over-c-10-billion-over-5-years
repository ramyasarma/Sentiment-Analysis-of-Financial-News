Vale SA , the world’s biggest iron-
ore producer, said it plans to invest more than C$10 billion
($9.8 billion) in Canada over five years to increase metals and
fertilizer output.  The plan includes starting output at the Totten nickel mine
in southeastern Canada next year and building a plant to process
the metal, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a
statement. Vale, the world’s second-largest nickel producer,
also said it’s studying a project to produce 2.9 million metric
tons of potash annually in Canada.  Vale is investing in mines from Brazil to Australia as
rising Asian demand for metals boosts profits. Third-quarter net
income more than tripled to $6.04 billion from $1.68 billion a
year earlier, the company said last month.  Vale rose 6 centavos, or 0.1 percent, to 48.31 reais in Sao
Paulo trading today.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel is the world’s biggest producer of
nickel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
