England’s Rugby Football Union
posted a loss of 1.1 million pounds ($1.75 million) for the year
to June 30 as ticket income fell on fewer international home
games.  The RFU had a profit of 6.2 million pounds in the previous
year. Ticket income in 2009-10 declined to 21.3 million pounds
from 29.2 million and total revenue dropped to 112 million
pounds from 119.2 million.  “Although down on a strong 2008-09, the past year was in
line with expectations,” the governing body’s Finance Director
Nick Eastwood said in a statement.  He said the decline in overall revenue was “mainly due to
having three instead of four Investec Internationals and two
instead of three RBS 6 Nations home games,” which led to the
fall in ticket income.  Operating profit fell to 25.8 million pounds from 31.8
million, and pretax profit dropped to 1.9 million pounds from 9
million.  The RFU had put in place a cost-reduction program agreed on
early in 2009 to respond to the global recession. Total costs
were 86.2 million pounds, after 87.4 million the previous year.  Eastwood said the RFU had continued its “substantial
investment” in community rugby, which in total was about 21
million pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
