New York  Governor  David Paterson 
will call a session of the Legislature for Nov. 29 to deal with
“unfinished business,” according to a statement from his
office today.  Lawmakers must approve spending cuts to eliminate a $315
million deficit projected for the year that ends March 31, state
Budget Director  Robert Megna  said this week.  Paterson “will push very hard so he does not end his
administration with any kind of deficit,” Megna said Nov. 15,
after a budget hearing. The $9 billion gap forecast by the
Budget Division for next year could be $10 billion, he said.  Paterson, a Democrat who didn’t run for election, will be
succeeded by state Attorney General  Andrew Cuomo , also a
Democrat, on Jan. 1.  On Oct. 26, Paterson said he would order lawmakers back to
Albany, the state capital, to reorganize the bankrupt New York
City  Off-Track Betting Corp.  He said lawmakers also would be
asked to approve a revised education bill that Paterson vetoed
in July because it would have changed the formula for school aid
in a way that would have cost the state $600 million over two
years.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
