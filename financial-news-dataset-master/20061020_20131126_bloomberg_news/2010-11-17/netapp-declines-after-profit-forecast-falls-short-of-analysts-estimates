NetApp Inc. , a maker of data-storage
products, dropped 6.5 percent after its third-quarter profit
forecast fell short of analysts’ estimates, fueling concern that
a recent surge in storage spending is losing steam.  Excluding some costs, earnings will be 48 cents to 50 cents
this quarter, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said today
in a statement. Analysts had projected 51 cents, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will be $1.24 billion to $1.29
billion, in line with  analysts’ estimates .  NetApp  is the third-biggest seller of external computer-
storage systems -- technology that helps companies store
information more efficiently while letting them access the data
from anywhere. The company has benefited from a rebound in
information-technology spending, though that growth is projected
to slow next year. Corporate technology spending will rise 4
percent in 2011, from an estimated 7 percent this year,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The company also faces mounting competition from EMC Corp.,
which bulked up in storage this week with the $2.25 billion
acquisition of Isilon Systems Inc. NetApp ranks behind EMC and
 International Business Machines Corp.  in external-storage sales,
according to IDC.  NetApp declined $3.44 to $49.25 as of 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have risen 43 percent
this year.  In the fiscal  second quarter , NetApp’s net income rose 72
percent to $164.6 million, or 42 cents a share, from $95.7
million, or 27 cents, a year earlier. Excluding some costs,
profit was 52 cents a share, topping the 49-cent average
estimate of  analysts . Sales climbed 33 percent to $1.21 billion
in the period, which ended Oct. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
