Irish bonds rose after Finance
Minister  Brian Lenihan  said potential aid talks for the
government’s banks will start tomorrow.  The nation’s debt fell earlier after LCH Clearnet Ltd.
raised the deposit clients must pay to trade the nation’s
securities for the second time in a week in response to soaring
yields. Lenihan said he will hold talks with the European
Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary
Fund on the country’s banks. German bonds climbed.  “The margin requirement increase isn’t good for Irish
bonds, but it makes an aid deal more likely,” said  Charles Diebel , head of market strategy at Lloyds TSB Corporate Bank in
London. “It seems pretty inevitable that some kind of deal will
be done. It’s just a question of how and what the details are.”  The yield on the 10-year Irish bond fell 14 basis points to
8.32 percent at 4:35 p.m. in London after jumping 31 basis
points yesterday. The 5 percent security due October 2020 rose
0.775, or 7.75 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,351) face amount, to
78.14. German 10-year yields fell three basis points to 2.6
percent.  The difference in  yield , or spread, between Irish and
German 10-year bonds narrowed 10 basis points to 552 basis
points, according to Bloomberg generic prices.  ‘Definite Decision’  The Europe Stoxx 600 Index of shares gained 0.5 percent
after falling 2.3 percent yesterday, the biggest one-day decline
since July 1, while the Irish Overall Index gained 1.5 percent
after a 1.7 percent drop yesterday. The euro climbed 0.3 percent
to $1.3535 after falling 1.5 percent over the previous two days.
It reached a 10-month high of $1.4282 on Nov. 4.  European finance ministers ended a two-day meeting in
Brussels to discuss the crisis.  “The Irish government in the coming days has to make a
definite decision,” Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters after chairing the meeting yesterday.
Ireland said it doesn’t need European Union money.  EU and IMF experts will start scanning the books of
Ireland’s debt-laden banks tomorrow in Dublin in a prelude to a
possible aid package. Finance chiefs from the 16-country euro
area said the joint assessment will determine whether Ireland
can fix the banking system on its own or needs to fall back on
the EU-IMF 750 billion-euro rescue fund.  Margin Requirement  LCH raised its margin  requirement  on Irish bonds by 15
percent on Nov. 10. Today’s further 15 percent increase will be
based on outstanding positions at the close of business tomorrow
and reflected in a so-called margin call on Nov. 19, the
clearing house said on its website today. The change applies to
Irish government bond repurchase agreements cleared through its
RepoClear service, it said.  LCH boosted the margin requirement after the yield on Irish
10-year government bonds stayed “consistently” more than 500
basis points above a AAA benchmark, it said. The spread between
Irish 10-year bonds and the benchmark widened four basis points
to 541 basis points today.  “We are not making any judgment on Irish
creditworthiness,”  John Burke , head of fixed income at LCH,
said today in an interview. “This decision is based solely on
government bond-spread data.” There is no limit to potential
extra margin charges, and while the company will continue to
monitor the market, there are no current plans for another
increase, he said.  Greek Bonds  Greek bonds fell versus bunds after Austrian Finance
Minister  Josef Proell  said payment of the next tranche of aid
for the Mediterranean nation will be delayed until January from
December.  The Greek-German 10-year yield spread widened five basis
points to 905 basis points. The Portuguese-German spread
narrowed six basis points to 409, and the Spanish spread grew
four basis points to 203.  While Ireland is fully funded until the middle of next
year, the yield on Irish 10-year bonds soared to a record 652
basis points above bunds on Nov. 11. Portugal’s yield spread
over Germany climbed to a record 484 basis points the same day.  Irish government bonds lost investors 12.5 percent this
year, compared with a 9.9 percent loss for Portuguese bonds,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds
returned 7.3 percent, while U.S. Treasuries earned 7.6 percent.  Credit-default swaps on Ireland rose eight basis points to
527, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Greece jumped
32 basis points to 960, Portugal fell 10 to 412, Italy was two
higher at 188 and Spain was unchanged at 257.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
