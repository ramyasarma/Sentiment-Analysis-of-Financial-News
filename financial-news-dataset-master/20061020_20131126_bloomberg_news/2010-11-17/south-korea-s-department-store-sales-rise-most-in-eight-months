Sales at South Korea’s major
department stores increased at the fastest pace in eight months
as unusually cold weather boosted demand for clothes.  Outlays  at the three biggest chains climbed 13.3 percent in
October from a year earlier, after rising 6.4 percent in
September, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a statement
today. The gain was the biggest since February.  The report provides some relief for a nation where consumer
confidence fell to a 16-month low in October amid concern an
advance in the won and slower global growth may sap the recovery.
The economic growth rate halved last quarter to 0.7 percent from
the previous three months as a stronger currency threatened
exports, which are also under risk from elevated U.S.
unemployment and European austerity measures.  Discount-store sales  were unchanged last month, stagnating
after an 18 percent surge in September that was fueled by
holiday demand for food amid soaring vegetable prices.  The Bank of Korea this week joined India and Australia in
boosting borrowing costs this month as inflation surged past the
central bank’s ceiling.  To contact the reporters on this story:
