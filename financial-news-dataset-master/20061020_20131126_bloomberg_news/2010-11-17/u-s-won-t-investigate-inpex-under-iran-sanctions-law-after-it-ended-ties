The U.S. State Department won’t
investigate  Inpex Corp.  under an American sanctions law after
Japan’s biggest energy explorer withdrew from a $2 billion
project in Iran’s South Azadegan oil field and vowed to quit
doing business with the Persian Gulf country.  Inpex will avoid U.S. sanctions “as long as the company
continues to act in accordance with its assurances,” the State
Department said today in an e-mailed statement. “We hope that
other firms will follow their lead.”  Inpex’s affiliate, Azadegan Petroleum Development Ltd.,
reached an agreement on Oct. 15 with the National Iranian Oil
Co. on the withdrawal. The company had a 10 percent stake in the
project. The move came after Japan said on Sept. 3 it is
suspending new oil and gas investments in Iran and freezing the
assets of 88 organizations and 24 individuals.  Inpex, which won rights to the Iranian oilfield in 2004,
cut its stake from 75 percent in October 2006 in part because of
Iran’s nuclear program. Japan’s trade ministry  owns  about 19
percent of Tokyo-based Inpex.  Iran is under sanctions from the United Nations and the
U.S. designed to keep the country from developing nuclear
weapons. Iran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful
purposes.  Expanded U.S. sanctions on Iran and businesses active there
have prompted  Royal Dutch Shell Plc , France’s Total SA, Italy’s
 Eni SpA  and Norway’s  Statoil ASA  to stop investing in the
country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
