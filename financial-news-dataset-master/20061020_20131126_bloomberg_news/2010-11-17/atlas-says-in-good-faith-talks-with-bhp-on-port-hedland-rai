Atlas Iron Ltd. , an Australian iron
ore producer, is in talks to use one of BHP Billiton Ltd.’s
railroads in the Pilbara region to transport the steelmaking raw
material to port.  The two companies have agreed to consider “point to point
rail haulage on BHP Billiton’s declared Goldsworthy line” to
the junction of its Newman railroad, Perth-based Atlas said
today in a statement.  Port Hedland, on Australia’s north-west coast, is used by
BHP, which controls seven iron ore mines in the Pilbara, and
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. to ship ore. The Australian
Competition Tribunal ruled in June that BHP and Rio Tinto Group
must share some of their West Australian railroads with rivals.  The companies have agreed to conduct a study examining a
“multipurpose ore car and truck dumping hub” on the eastern
side of the Goldsworthy junction and the construction of a
conveyor to stockyards at Utah Point in Port Hedland, Atlas
said.  Atlas  rose 4.4 percent to A$2.87 at the 4:10 p.m. close in
Sydney of the Australian stock exchange. BHP, the world’s
biggest mining company, gained 0.8 percent to A$43.80.  To contact the reporters on this story:
