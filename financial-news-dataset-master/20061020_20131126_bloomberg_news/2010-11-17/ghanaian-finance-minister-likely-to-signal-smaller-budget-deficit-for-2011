Ghanaian Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  may announce plans to cut the fiscal deficit in the
budget tomorrow as the West African nation starts to reap
revenue from oil exports.  The government will earn between $600 million and $1
billion in the first full year of oil production in 2011,  Kofi Wampah , deputy governor of the Bank of Ghana said on Oct. 7.  “Oil revenue will increase expenditures between $420
million and $700 million next year” as the government saves
about 30 percent of receipts, said  Sampson Akligoh , an analyst
at Accra-based Databank Financial Services.  The budget deficit will narrow to between 3 percent and 5
percent of gross domestic product in 2011, the director of
budgets at the Ministry of Finance, Simeon Patrick Kyei, said in
an Oct. 26 interview. That estimate was issued before the
statistics office said the economy was 75 percent bigger than
previously estimated, slashing the shortfall as a percentage of
GDP.  The fiscal deficit will probably exceed 8 percent of GDP
this year, the  International Monetary Fund  said on Oct. 1, using
the previous estimate for the size of the economy.  Discovered in 2007, the Jubilee oil field will produce as
much as 240,000 barrels per day by 2014-15, according to the
state-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corp. The start-up of
production will help the economy expand 20 percent next year,
Duffuor said on Sept. 8. That figure will be reduced because of
the revision to GDP.  The new GDP numbers also cut tax receipts to 16 percent of
GDP from 28.1 percent and may trigger a drive to boost revenue
collection, said Alan Cameron, sub-Saharan Africa analyst at
Business Monitor International.  The government may announce “more efforts to bring the
informal economy into the formal” sector, he said in an e-
mailed comment Nov. 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
