Kenya’s fiscal revenue jumped in
October, putting the government in a better position to meet its
target for the financial year through June 30, a Finance
Ministry official said.  “October revenue has rebounded tremendously,” with
collection of value added tax up 40 percent from the year
earlier, said Henry Rotich, deputy director of economic affairs
at the ministry.
“So we are now more optimistic that we’ll definitely achieve
our targets.”  Poor revenue collection in the first quarter had led to
speculation the government would miss its goal. Receipts in the
three months through September were 132.9 billion shillings
($1.65 billion), about 4.9 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with a target of 154.9 billion shillings, the Finance
Ministry said on Nov. 12.  “Some of the measures introduced in the budget usually
take a while to implement,” Rotich said by phone today from the
capital, Nairobi. “What we are seeing in the second quarter is
that it’s improving, revenue is becoming normal, and we are
likely to meet the target for the year.”  Kenya’s economy is expected to expand by 5 percent this
year and 6 percent in 2011, President  Mwai Kibaki  said on Oct.
