CPC Corp. reported a fire at the
Taiwan state-owned company’s Kaohsiung oil refinery today.  The fire at the No. 7 crude distillation unit at Kaohsiung
in southern Taiwan started at about 11:10 a.m. after a pipeline
leak, CPC Vice President Paul Chen said by telephone in Taipei.
Fire fighters are at the scene tackling the blaze, he said.  Chen couldn’t say whether the unit, capable of processing
100,000 barrels of oil a day, had been shut down.  To contact the reporter on this story:
