A strike by workers at South
Africa’s South Deep mine operated by  Gold Fields Ltd. , Africa’s
second-biggest producer of the metal, entered its fourth day
today, according to the  National Union of Mineworkers .  With 90 percent of workers downing tools, operations have
stopped at the mine in Westonaria, 45 kilometers (28 miles)
southwest of Johannesburg, NUM spokesman Kanetso Matabane said
in a phone interview from South Deep.  Gold Fields spokesman  Sven Lunsche  said in an e-mailed
response to questions that the Johannesburg-based company may
comment later today. Between 15 percent and 38 percent of miners
participated in the strike, which had a “material” impact on
output, it said yesterday.  Workers are demanding that blacks be brought into senior
management positions and the company procures supplies from
black-owned business as part of South Africa’s attempts to
transform an economy dominated by whites during minority rule,
which ended in 1994.  The strike may widen to Gold Fields’ three other mines in
South Africa if the issue isn’t resolved, NUM spokesman Kenneth
Buda said in a separate phone interview from Johannesburg today.  “We’ve not yet started with the roll-out of the strike,”
Buda said. “The issue will be discussed with shop stewards and
workers and then you have to give a notice. At the executive
level we’ve already discussed that and resolved that there is a
need for a secondary strike.”  Gold Fields fell 2.67 rand, or 2.2 percent, to 118.99 rand
yesterday, its biggest drop since Sept. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
