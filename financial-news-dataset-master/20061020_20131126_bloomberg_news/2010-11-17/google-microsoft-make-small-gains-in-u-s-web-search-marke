Google Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp. 
added less than half a percentage point of market share apiece
in U.S. Internet searches last month, while  Yahoo! Inc.  lost
ground, according to ComScore Inc.  Google  had 66.3 percent of the market in October, up from
66.1 percent the previous month, Reston, the Virginia-based
research firm said today. Microsoft’s Bing climbed to 11.5
percent from 11.2 percent.  Microsoft and  Yahoo  are teaming up to challenge Google’s
dominance in the market, relying on a 10-year search agreement
that puts Bing on Yahoo sites. Combined, they handled 28 percent
of queries last month, up from 27.9 percent. The companies are
jockeying with Google for a bigger piece of the search
advertising market, which may account for 49 percent of total
U.S. online ad spending this year. That’s up from 47 percent in
2009, according to EMarketer Inc. in New York.  Google , based in Mountain View, California, fell 17 cents
to $583.55 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Yahoo, located in nearby Sunnyvale, declined 9 cents to $16.15.
 Microsoft , based in Redmond, Washington, dropped 24 cents to
$25.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
