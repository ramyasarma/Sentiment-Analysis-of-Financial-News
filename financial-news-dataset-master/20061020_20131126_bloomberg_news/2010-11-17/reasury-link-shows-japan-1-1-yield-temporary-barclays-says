Gains in Japanese 10-year bond
 yields  beyond a two-month high of 1.1 percent will be
"temporary" based on the securities’ correlation with U.S. debt,
according to Barclays Capital Japan Ltd.  Japan’s 10-year yields fluctuate at roughly one-third of
the pace of similar-maturity Treasury rates, based on the so-
called beta figure shown by a regression analysis of the
securities over the past year, said  Reiko Tokukatsu , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Barclays.  Ten-year Treasury note yields increased 51 basis points
from Nov. 4 low to 2.96 percent on Nov. 15. The regression
pattern predicts a 17 basis-point increase for yields on
similar-dated Japanese debt, from 0.915 percent to 1.085
percent.  “For Japan’s long-term yields, levels higher than 1.1
percent will be excessive,” Tokyo-based Tokukatsu said. “Any
rise above that level will be temporary.”  U.S. 10-year yields increased 17 basis points to 2.96
percent on Nov. 15, the highest level since Aug. 6. Those on
Japanese notes finished at 1.025 percent yesterday, after
earlier rising to 1.09 percent, the most since Sept. 15.  “Gains in Japan’s yields will be capped at 5 basis points
after the 17 basis-point surge in U.S. rates,” Tokukatsu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
