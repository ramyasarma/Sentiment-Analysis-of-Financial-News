Citigroup Inc. , the lender 12
percent-owned by U.S. taxpayers, expects more than half of its
potential revenue growth in retail banking may be tied to
emerging markets, according to consumer head  Manuel Medina-Mora .  Emerging markets are likely to make up 55 percent of total
consumer banking revenue growth over the next three years,
increasing at a compound annual rate 10 percent, Medina-Mora
said today at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Banking and
Financial Services Conference. This compares with a 5 percent
expansion in the U.S., Medina-Mora said.  Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  appointed Medina-Mora
in January to lead the bank’s international retail strategy,
which includes reviving North American operations.  Net income  at
the domestic retail unit has tumbled 67 percent to $231 million
this year through September, while the Asian and Latin American
divisions more than doubled net income to $3.1 billion.  “Asia Pacific and Latin America have generated the vast
majority of our net income in the last 12 months as these
economies have recovered at a much faster rate,” Medina-Mora
said. The New York-based lender is targeting 150 cities
worldwide to increase profit from consumer banking, with 116 of
the cities in emerging markets, he said.  Citigroup fell 3 cents to $4.19 at 11:24 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 27
percent this year through yesterday.
