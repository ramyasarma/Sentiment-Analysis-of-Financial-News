U.S. stocks fluctuated, a day after
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  posted its biggest drop since
August, after financial shares slipped and investors speculated
slower-than-estimated inflation helped justify the Federal
Reserve’s plan to buy Treasuries.  JPMorgan Chase and Co. and Bank of America Corp. led shares
of financial companies to the biggest  decline  in the S&P 500
Index. Target Corp. gained 2 percent as the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer posted a 23 percent increase in third-quarter
profit after its credit-card unit doubled earnings.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,177.5 at 9:47 a.m. in New
York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slipped 0.1 percent to
11,012.98.  “Both inflation and housing data are consistent with the
Fed has been saying, said Stephen Wood, the New York-based chief
market strategist for Russell Investments, which manages $140
billion. ‘‘It doesn’t give investors reason to question the
policy. That takes some weight out of the stock market. The Fed
should remain accommodative, which is a friendly environment for
stocks. On the other hand, there’s a sense that the market
underestimated the Chinese tightening policy. That’s weighing
negatively on sentiment.”  The consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent after a 0.1
percent rise the prior month, the Labor Department said today in  Washington. A 0.3 percent gain was forecast by economists,
according to the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.
Excluding food and fuel, so-called core costs increased 0.6
percent from October 2009, the smallest gain on record.  A separate report showed  housing  starts fell to a 519,000
annual rate, the fewest since a record low reached in April 2009
and down 12 percent from a revised 588,000 in September that was
less than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said
today in Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
