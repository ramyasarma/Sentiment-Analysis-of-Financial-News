Chinese companies transmitted
erroneous Internet-traffic instructions in April that briefly
diverted about 15 percent of global Web traffic through servers
in China, according to a U.S. government report released today.  The incident, which lasted about 18 minutes on April 8,
affected traffic from U.S. military and government sites, as
well as those for  Dell Inc. ,  Yahoo! Inc. ,  Microsoft Corp.  and
 International Business Machines Corp. , according to the report
by the  U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission .  The commission, created in 2000 to advise Congress about
national security implications of U.S. relations with China,
said that “perhaps most disconcertingly” the diverted data
might “possibly allow a telecommunications firm to compromise
the integrity of supposedly secure encrypted sessions.”  The level of access also might have allowed surveillance of
specific users or sites, the report said. Evidence doesn’t
indicate whether the misdirection was intentional, or why it
occurred, the commission said.  The misdirection originated with an Internet service
provider, IDC China Telecommunications, and was propagated by
state-owned China Telecom, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
