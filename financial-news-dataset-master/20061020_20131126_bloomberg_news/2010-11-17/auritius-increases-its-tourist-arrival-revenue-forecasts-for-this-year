Mauritius raised its forecast for an
increase in tourist arrivals in 2010 to 5.6 percent, the
statistics agency said.  The estimate was raised from 5 percent, the country’s data
office, based in Port Louis, said in a bulletin published on its
website today. The Indian Ocean island country is expected to
attract 920,000 tourists this year compared with 871,356 in
2009.  Europe is the main market representing 64 percent of total
tourist arrivals, with 31 percent of the total traveling from
France, the agency said. Tourism revenue is set to increase 2.8
percent to 39 billion rupees ($1.3 billion), it said, citing the

950,000 visitors in 2011, earning the country 41 billion rupees,
