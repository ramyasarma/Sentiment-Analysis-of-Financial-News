Humanitarian organizations should
prepare for food shortages in parts of East Africa amid
forecasts of erratic rains across the region, the Nairobi-based
Food Security & Nutrition Working Group said.  Uganda, Sudan and western Kenya may face flooding between
late 2010 and mid-2011, while parts of Rwanda and Burundi,
eastern Kenya, Somalia, southeastern Ethiopia and Djibouti could
suffer from failed rains, according to an e-mailed statement
today from the organization.  Humanitarian organization need to prepare now to “protect
livelihoods and avoid later costly lifesaving emergency
interventions,” the group said.  The erratic rains will be caused by the La Niña climatic
event, when cooler than normal sea-surface temperatures in the
central and eastern tropical Pacific ocean impact global weather
patterns.  To contact the reporter on this story:  William Davison  in Addis
