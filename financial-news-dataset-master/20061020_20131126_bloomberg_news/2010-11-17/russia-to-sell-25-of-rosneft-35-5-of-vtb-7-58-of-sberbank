Russia’s government approved
selling stakes in 10 major companies as part of a 1.8 trillion
ruble ($57.5 billion), five-year privatization program,
including stakes in  OAO Rosneft  and OAO Sberbank.  The government may sell 25 percent minus one share of
Rosneft, 35.5 percent minus one share of VTB Group and 7.58
percent minus one share of Sberbank under a plan for 2011-2013
that was approved today, Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  told
reporters in Moscow.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s government is
auctioning off assets to help cover a budget shortfall it
expects to reach 5.3 percent of gross domestic product this year
and 3.6 percent in 2011. Banks will advise on the proper timing
and terms of the sales, Nabiullina said, adding that companies
will reap 800 billion rubles, while the remaining 1 trillion
rubles will go into the federal budget.  Russia plans to auction off state stakes in eight companies
next year each valued at 500 million rubles or more, including
sales of stakes in OAO Apatit, OAO PhosAgro’s flagship
phosphate-mining division, S7 airline and Vostochny port,
Nabiullina said. The government seeks to earn 1 trillion rubles
in the next three years.  The country’s last major asset sale was in 2007, when VTB
raised $8 billion in the biggest initial public offering that
year. Oil producer OAO Rosneft’s IPO a year earlier raised $10.6
billion.  The government owns 75.16 percent of Rosneft, the country’s
biggest oil producer, 60.3 percent of Sberbank and 85.5 percent
of VTB, the two biggest lenders, according to company websites
and data compiled by Bloomberg.  Last month Russia selected 10 banks including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Renaissance Capital and VTB Capital as
advisers for its planned sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
