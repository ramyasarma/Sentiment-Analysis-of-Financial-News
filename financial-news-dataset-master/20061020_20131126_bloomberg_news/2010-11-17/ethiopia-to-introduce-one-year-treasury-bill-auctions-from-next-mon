Ethiopia will introduce a one-year
treasury bill and begin weekly auctions in December, the
government said in a letter to the International Monetary Fund.  The Horn of Africa nation is planning the sales “to refine
our liquidity management capability,” according to the letter,
which was signed by Finance Minister  Sufian Ahmed  and central
bank Governor  Teklewold Atnafu .  Treasury bill auctions are held sporadically and the notes
are sold in durations of 28, 91 and 182 days. State-owned
commercial banks are the main buyers of the notes, which had an
average weighted yield of 0.778 percent in the last three months
of 2009, the latest period of data available, according to the
National Bank of Ethiopia’s website.  In 2008, the National Bank of Ethiopia raised reserve
requirements for commercial banks in an effort to reduce the
amount of money in circulation and quell inflation, which peaked
at 64.2 percent in July of that year. The rate declined to 10.6
percent last month, according to the Central Statistics Agency.  The country is also targeting economic growth of 11 percent
in 2010-11, though the government said it is making a
“conservative assumption” of 8.5 percent growth, the IMF
letter said.  Africa’s largest coffee producer is aiming for a budget
deficit of 6.5 percent of gross domestic product during the same
period, according to the statement.  Ethiopia devalued its currency, the birr, 16.5 percent
against the U.S. dollar in September in an effort to boost
exports and reduce persistent trade deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
