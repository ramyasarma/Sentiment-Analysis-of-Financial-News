Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney ’s car was broken into by a thief in Montreal on Nov. 1
and a bag containing classified documents was stolen, the Globe &
Mail reported, citing  Jeremy Harrison , a spokesman for the
central bank.  While the papers had varying levels of security
classification, none were related to sensitive policy matters
such as the direction of interest rates, the newspaper said.  The incident led to a review of the bank’s security
procedures, policies and training, the Globe & Mail cited the
spokesman as saying.   The car was left in the care of one of the bank’s drivers,
who are expected to “exercise sound judgment” and
“demonstrate security awareness,” the newspaper reported.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
