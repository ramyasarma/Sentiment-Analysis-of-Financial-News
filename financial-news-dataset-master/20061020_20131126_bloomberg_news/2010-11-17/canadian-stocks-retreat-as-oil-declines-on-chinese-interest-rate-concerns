Canadian stocks  gained for the first
time in five days as gold producers rose on a weaker U.S. dollar
and a plan by EBX Group Ltd. to acquire Ventana Gold Corp.  Ventana Gold surged 39 percent after EBX said it would make
an all-cash offer for shares it doesn’t already own at a 26
percent premium to yesterday’s closing price. Barrick Gold
Corp., the world’s largest producer of the metal, and Kinross
Gold Corp. gained at least 0.4 percent as the U.S. dollar
declined against a basket of currencies. Celtic Exploration Ltd.
surged 19 percent after it said one of its wells produced
natural gas.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 55.60
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,657.83 as of 4 p.m. in Toronto.  “The mini-correction we were going through has kind of
taken a pause here,” said  Tony Demarin , chief investment
officer at BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which
manages about C$230 million ($226 million). “The overlay of
European debt issues is what’s primarily driving the global
financial market these days. Banking is very connected to debt
in governments and a weak housing market in the U.S., which the
banks hold a lot of mortgages. Gold has taken a bit of a
pause.”  Metal producers rallied as recovering economies in Asia and
a weaker U.S. dollar boosted demand for the precious metal. A
gauge of materials producers in the S&P/TSX was the best-
performing group in the index as gold rebounded from the lowest
price in two weeks.  Ventana Surges  Ventana Gold, which owns the La Bodega gold project in
Colombia, surged 39 percent to C$13.90 for the biggest gain in
the S&P/TSX. EBX, a Rio de Janeiro-based investment company
controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, said it plans
to make an all-cash offer to acquire Ventana at C$12.63 a share.  Barrick Gold rose 0.9 percent to C$50.43. Kinross Gold,
Canada’s third-largest gold producer, gained 0.4 percent to
C$17.87. Greystar Resources Ltd., the owner of the Angostura
gold and silver project in Colombia, jumped 14 percent to
C$5.08.  NovaGold Resources Inc., which explores in Alaska and
British Columbia, jumped 6.5 percent to C$14.66 for the third-
biggest gain in the benchmark index. Rubicon Minerals Corp.,
which explores for gold in Canada and the U.S., advanced 4.9
percent to C$4.10. Gold companies make up 11 percent of Canadian
stocks by market value, according to Bloomberg data.  Celtic Exploration surged 19 percent to C$15.55 for the
second-biggest gain in the benchmark index. The Western Canadian
natural gas producer said its new Triassic Montney pool in the
Resthaven area began producing natural gas at a rate of 10.2
million cubic feet per day after six days of testing.  Silvercorp Gains  Silvercorp Metals Inc., which mines in China, gained 5.9
percent to C$11.58 as silver futures rose. Silver reseller
Silver Wheaton Corp. rose 3.5 percent to C$33.55. Cameco Corp.,
the world’s second-largest uranium producer, advanced 1.8
percent to C$34.90.  Resverlogix Corp. plummeted 39 percent to C$2.73, adding to
its 30 percent drop yesterday. New research on the company’s
experimental cholesterol pill today was overshadowed by “very
impressive” results on a similar cholesterol treatment from
Merck & Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
