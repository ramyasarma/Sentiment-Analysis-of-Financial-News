A proposal by Real Madrid and
Barcelona to reduce their share of Spanish soccer league
television revenue from 2015 was accepted by 11 of 20 first-
division teams, club executives said.  While those clubs will try to push ahead with the plan, six
teams -- Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Real Zaragoza, Real Sociedad,
Espanyol and Villarreal -- may ask competition authorities to
outlaw it, Sevilla President Jose Maria del Nido told a news
conference. Malaga is the only team that hasn’t decided on the
proposal.  Real and Barcelona, which get about half the $875 million
broadcast income by negotiating deals individually, agreed to a
collective agreement that would reduce their share to some 30
percent, league spokesman Juan Carlos Santamaria told reporters.  “There is no other country in Europe with such an
imbalance,”  Del Nido  said. “The championship would have been
sold beforehand” under such conditions, he added.  Osasuna President Patxi Izco said he supported the
“gesture” by the biggest two clubs, and his club would work
with them to increase the pool of television income. Osasuna
will increase TV income to 20 million euros ($27 million) a year
from 16 million euros under the accord, Izco said.  Real Madrid leads the league with 29 points after 11 games.
Champion Barcelona is a point behind, with Villarreal five
points further back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
