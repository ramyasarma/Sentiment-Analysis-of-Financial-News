Kenya’s benchmark coffee price
gained 9.5 percent at an auction yesterday after the quality of
the beans improved, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The top arabica AA grade sold for an average of $413.08 for
a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $377.07 a fortnight
earlier, the exchange said late yesterday in an e-mail from the
capital, Nairobi. Supplies of the grade rose 20 percent to 4,246
bags, it said. The average price for all coffee sold was little
changed at $295.16 per bag from $295 at the previous auction
after supplies increased, the agency said.  “There was some very good quality coffee at the auction,”
Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at the Nairobi-based Alanwood
Ltd., said by phone yesterday. “We are getting fresh supplies
from the new crop in the central region.”  Sales dropped 5.6 percent to 15,767 bags worth $5.47
million compared with the previous sale, the agency said.
Supplies at the fourth auction of the 2010-11 season rose 14
percent to 24,080 bags from two weeks earlier, the exchange
said. Kenya’s coffee exports through the Nairobi Coffee
Exchange, which handles the bulk of the shipments, retreated 7.2
percent in 2009-10 to 36,197 tons compared with a year earlier
after production declined, the agency said on Oct.1.  The country is yet to release output forecast for this
year, it said. Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to
June. The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
