U.K. natural gas contracts declined
amid increased deliveries from Norway and continued flows from
underground storage sites.  The  Langeled pipeline  was importing about 62 million cubic
meters of gas at 9 a.m. London time, National Grid Plc data
show. That’s higher than flows late yesterday. Norway is the
biggest foreign supplier to Britain.  Gas for delivery next month fell as much 0.35 pence, or 0.7
percent, to 47.9 pence a therm. The contract was at 48.1 pence
as of 9 a.m. in London, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s equal to $7.64 a million British thermal
units. A therm is equal to 100,000 Btus.  National Grid  forecast demand  will reach 347 million cubic
meters at 6 a.m. tomorrow, about 17 million more than usual for
this time of year. The nation’s pipelines will hold 340 million
cubic meters of gas at that time. That’s 3 million more than at
the start of today.  U.K.  storage sites , including Rough, the country’s largest,
were pumping a total of about 29 million cubic meters a day,
data from National Grid show. That’s about the same as
yesterday. Deliveries from liquefied natural gas terminals fell.  The next-week gas contract was stable at 49.35 pence a
therm. Gas for delivery today was little changed at 49 pence.  Baseload power in Britain for tomorrow fell 1.15 pounds to
44.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show. Power for
December fell 40 pence to 44.65 pounds a megawatt-hour. Baseload
is delivered around the clock.  Natural gas is used to produce about half of the U.K.’s
electricity, so changes in the fuel prices influence these
markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
