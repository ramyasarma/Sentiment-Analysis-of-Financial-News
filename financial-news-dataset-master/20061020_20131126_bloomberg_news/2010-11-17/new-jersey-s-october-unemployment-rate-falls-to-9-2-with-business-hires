New Jersey ’s unemployment rate
fell by 0.2 percentage point to 9.2 percent last month, the
lowest since May 2009, as businesses recruited workers,
according to the state’s labor department and data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Total employment in the state rose by 2,600 jobs to 3.8
million, with all the gains coming from companies hiring in
October. The federal, state and local government workforce
shrank 2,200 overall while private businesses created 4,800
jobs, the department said in a  news release  today.  Businesses in the state have added a net 1,500 jobs this
year through October, compared with 111,000 jobs eliminated
during the same period a year earlier, the figures show.  New Jersey lost 16,100 jobs in September, according to
revised data, compared with a preliminary estimate of 20,200
jobs lost, the department said.  The state’s  unemployment rate  was below the  national
unemployment rate  of 9.6 percent in October, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Industries that hired the most last month include
professional and business services that added 2,700 jobs, and
financial services, which added 1,600, the state said.  Construction lost 800 jobs in October, the state said. Last
month, Governor  Chris Christie  canceled work on a proposed $8.7
billion tunnel under the Hudson River, the largest
infrastructure-construction project in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
