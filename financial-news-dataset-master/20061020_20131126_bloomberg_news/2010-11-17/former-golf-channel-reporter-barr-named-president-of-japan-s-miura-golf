Former Golf Channel reporter  Adam
Barr  was named president of  Miura Golf  Inc., a Japan-based
manufacturer of custom golf clubs.  Barr, a 49-year-old former trial lawyer from Pittsburgh, is
being hired as the Himeji, Japan-based company seeks to expand
its profile among casual golfers, according to Bill Holowaty,
Miura’s Vancouver, British Columbia-based executive vice
president.  Miura doesn’t have endorsement agreements with any U.S. PGA
Tour players and markets itself as a “premium” brand. A set of
eight custom-made Miura irons costs between $1,700 and $2,000,
almost twice as much as a set of irons made by companies such as
 Callaway Golf Co. ,  Fortune Brands Inc. ’s Titleist brand and  Nike
Inc.   Barr will help Miura tell its “ story  to as many people as
possible,” while having “all the responsibilities of a
traditional company president,” Holowaty said.  Barr also will oversee the closely held company’s social
media strategy to help promote and market the brand, Holowaty
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
