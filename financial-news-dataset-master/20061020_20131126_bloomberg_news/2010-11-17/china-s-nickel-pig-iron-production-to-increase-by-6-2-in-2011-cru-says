China’s production of nickel pig
iron will rise 6.2 percent to 155,000 metric tons next year,
with Chinese stainless steel producers substituting about one-
third of primary nickel with the cheaper alternative, CRU said.  “Nickel pig iron is the swing producer in the nickel
market,”  Vanessa Davidson , a London-based analyst at CRU, today
said at the New Caledonia Nickel Conference in Noumea. “About
30 percent of total primary nickel in China’s stainless steel
production is from nickel pig iron.”  Chinese stainless steelmakers began substituting nickel
with nickel pig iron in 2003 in response to rising prices.
Nickel pig iron, a form of ferronickel, is priced as much as 15
percent less than the London Metal Exchange nickel price because
of its higher levels of impurities than refined nickel.  Nickel is the second-best performer on the London Metal
Exchange this year, driven by rebounding demand from stainless
steelmakers. Prices have traded at an average of $21,624 a ton
since the start of the year. Nickel prices last year surged by
58 percent.  CRU counts 88 nickel pig iron producers in China with
capacity of 600,000 metric tons. Some capacity has been closed
because of the government’s efforts to curb energy use and shut
down polluting industries, Davidson said.  Stainless steel usage accounts for two-thirds of nickel
demand. This year global output of stainless steel will increase
to at least 30 million tons from 24 million tons last year,
Bureau of International Recycling said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
