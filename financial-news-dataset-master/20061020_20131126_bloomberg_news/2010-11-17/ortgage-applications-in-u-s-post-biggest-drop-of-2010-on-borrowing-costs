The number of U.S. mortgage
applications dropped last week by the most this year as an
increase in borrowing costs caused refinancing to plunge.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  fell 14 percent in
the week ended Nov. 12, the Washington-based group said today.
 Refinancing plummeted  17 percent, the most since early April,
and  purchase applications  were down 5 percent.  The increase in mortgage rates comes as data have shown the
economic recovery picked up at the start of the fourth quarter,
raising concern the  Federal Reserve ’s second round of asset
purchases that began last week was unnecessary.  Unemployment 
near 10 percent and state probes into lenders’ foreclosure
procedures are other reasons potential buyers may hold off on
home purchases.  “Yields in the market have moved up, and if the mortgage
refinancing window has not shut, it soon will,”  Chris Rupkey ,
chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
in New York, said before the report. “Mortgage rates are moving
up sharply with Treasury yields. Consumers are still cautious on
the outlook for the economy, so they’re hesitating to buy the
biggest of big-ticket items, the family house.”  Banks were also closed one day last week for the Veterans
Day holiday on Nov. 11, which may have contributed to the drop
in applications. Holidays make it difficult to adjust the data
for seasonal variations.  The average rate on a 30-year  fixed mortgage  rose to 4.46
percent from 4.28 percent. The 4.21 percent rate reported for
the week ended Oct. 8 was the lowest in records going back to
1990.  Monthly Payments  At the current lending rate, monthly payments for each
$100,000 of a loan would be about $504, or $22 less than a year
ago when the rate was 4.82 percent.  The average rate on a 15-year fixed loan rose to 3.87
percent from 3.64 percent, and the rate on a one-year adjustable
mortgage increased to 7.11 percent from 7.08 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to
2.79 percent at the end of the day on Nov. 12 from 2.53 percent
the prior week. On Nov. 5, the Labor Department reported the
employers added 151,000 workers to payrolls, more than double
the median forecast of economists surveyed.  The Fed on Nov. 13 began buying the first allotment of what
it said earlier this month would be $600 billion in asset
purchases through June. Treasuries rallied beginning in
September after Fed officials began signaling such purchases
were likely.  Less Refinancing  The share of applicants seeking to refinance fell to 80.3
percent from 81.7 percent the prior week, the Mortgage Bankers
Association said.  Another report today may show work began on 598,000 homes
at an annual pace in October, down from 610,000 in September,
according to the median  forecast  of economists surveyed before a
Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. today.  D.R. Horton Inc ., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, expects 2011 to be “challenging” for the industry as
consumer confidence and employment remain weak, Chief Executive
Officer  Donald Tomnitz  said Nov. 12.  The company’s home sales and closing volume probably will
fall from this year, Tomnitz said on an earnings conference
call. The 2011 spring selling season, typically the strongest
time of year for builders, may fail to bring the traditional
boost in demand, he said.  “I don’t see much on the horizon that would give anybody a
great degree of comfort on the financial condition of the
country,” Tomnitz said. “I just don’t see a lot of hope for a
great spring market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
