Pininfarina SpA , designer of Ferrari
SpA’s Testa Rossa and Fiat SpA’s Alfa Spider, said it’s seeking
bids from potential buyers. Magna International Inc. said it’s
interested in purchasing the company.  Pininfarina “will communicate any advanced talks when they
take place,” the Italian company said in a statement today. The
designer of Ferrari’s California, Maserati SpA’s Gran Turismo
and  Volvo Cars C70  appointed Banca Leonardo to advise on a
possible sale in August 2009.  “This type of acquisition would be one that would earn us
additional competence on development matters,” Dieter Althaus,
a vice president at  Magna ’s European unit, said today by
telephone. “We’re also very considerably engaged in the field
of engineering and that’s where design and technology also play
a role.”  Pininfarina  expects a 2010 loss wider than last year’s
after the nine-month net loss broadened to 33.8 million euros
(45.8 million) from 18.1 million euros a year earlier, it said
Nov. 12. The shares rose 22 percent to 3.51 euros in Milan
today, the biggest gain in 19 months, valuing the luxury-car
designer at 105.9 million euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
