Oil rose from a four-week low after
U.S. crude  inventories  unexpectedly dropped the most since
August 2009, signaling fuel demand in the world’s biggest
consumer may be recovering.  Futures retraced some of yesterday’s 2.3 percent slump,
snapping four days of declines, after the Energy Department said
stockpiles shrank 7.3 million barrels last week. They were
 forecast  to be unchanged, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of analysts.  Gasoline  and distillate supplies also decreased.  “It’s good to see stockpiles sliding because that’s giving
a sense of relief that something’s happening” with oil
fundamentals, said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of
Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney. “It seems to be the
start of a trend. It could be that consumption is improving.”  Crude for December delivery advanced as much as $1.12, or
1.4 percent, to $81.56 a barrel, in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. It was at $81.48 at 3:20 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract, which expires tomorrow, fell
yesterday to $80.44, the lowest settlement since Oct. 19. The
more actively traded January future was up $1.04 at $82.08.  Crude slumped yesterday amid speculation that China, the
world’s biggest energy-consuming country, will raise interest
rates to cool economic growth. Prices also dropped on concern
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. Oil has fallen 4 percent
since last week and is up 2.7 percent this year.  Fuel Supplies  Gasoline inventories  slipped  2.66 million barrels to 207.7
million, the lowest level since the week ended Oct. 16, 2009,
the Energy Department report showed. They were  projected  to
slide 750,000 barrels, according to the Bloomberg News survey.
Imports were the lowest since January 2004.  Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, fell 1.11 million barrels to 158.8
million. They were  forecast  to decline 2 million barrels.  The Energy Department report showed crude  imports tumbled 
2.8 percent to 7.86 million barrels a day, the lowest level
since December.  “The weekly data’s most striking feature may have been the
continued weakness in imports,”  Antoine Halff , head of energy
research at broker Newedge, said in a report yesterday.  Brent crude for January settlement rose as much as $1.11,
or 1.3 percent, to $84.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The contract yesterday slid 1.7 percent
to $83.28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
