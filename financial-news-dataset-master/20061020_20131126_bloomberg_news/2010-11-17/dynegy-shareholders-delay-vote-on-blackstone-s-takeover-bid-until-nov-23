Dynegy Inc. delayed until Nov. 23
voting on a takeover bid, giving Chief Executive Officer Bruce
Williamson more time to win approval for the $604.5 million
offer by Blackstone Group LP, after the world’s largest private-
equity firm raised its bid yesterday.  The delay was announced at Dynegy’s headquarters in Houston
today.  Blackstone’s bid is opposed by Dynegy’s largest
shareholders, billionaire investor Carl Icahn and hedge fund
Seneca Capital, who say the U.S power producer is worth more.  Blackstone raised its offer 11 percent yesterday
by 50 cents a share to $5, or $4.77 billion including assumption
of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
