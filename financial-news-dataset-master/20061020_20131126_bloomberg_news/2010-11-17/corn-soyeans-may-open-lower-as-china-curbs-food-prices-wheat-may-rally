What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower
on the Chicago Board of Trade on concern that plans to curb
inflation and crack down on speculative trading will reduce
demand in China, said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president
at the Linn Group in Chicago. Soybean-meal futures may open $1
to $2 lower per 2,000 pounds, and soybean oil is expected to
open down 0.6 cent to 0.7 cent a pound.  -- Corn futures are called steady to 3 cents a bushel lower on
concern that plans by China and Europe to crack down on
speculation in agricultural commodities will reduce investment
demand, Huckabay said.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange on speculation that adverse weather reduced
output in Australia and Canada, increasing demand for supplies
from the U.S., Huckabay said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
