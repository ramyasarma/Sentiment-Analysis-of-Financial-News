Brazilian police are organizing a
nationwide strike for the first few days of 2011 to demand a pay
raise that the government says would cost 43.5 billion reais
($25.2 billion) annually.  Representative  Paulo Pereira  da Silva urged ministers and
fellow legislators in a meeting today at the presidential palace
in Brasilia to “find a solution” for the wage demands. Police
in Sao Paulo earn 1,400 reais monthly and have a daily meal
voucher of 4 reais, which isn’t enough to buy a soda and snack,
Silva said.  “They want a solution,” Silva said. “We can’t play
around anymore.”  Budget and Planning Minister  Paulo Bernardo  said in the
meeting that any wage increase should be discussed next year,
“otherwise we will be generating expenses” for President-elect
 Dilma Rousseff  and state governors that they can’t afford.  To contact the reporter on this story:
