First Solar Inc . expects the German
solar market to shrink in 2011, Handelsblatt reported, citing an
interview with Chief Executive Officer Rob Gillette.  The German market, which was until now the biggest market
for First Solar, will only represent 25 percent to 30 percent of
the company’s revenue at the end of next year, Gillette told the
newspaper. North America will become the biggest market, the CEO
is cited as saying.  The world’s biggest solar company plans to almost double
production capacity by 2012, which would give it almost a fifth
of the global market, according to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
