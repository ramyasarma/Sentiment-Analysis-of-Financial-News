Allegheny Technologies Inc. , a U.S.
specialty-metals producer, agreed to acquire Ladish Co. in a
cash-and-stock transaction valued at $778 million to expand its
offerings in the aerospace sector.  Ladish shareholders will receive $24 in cash and 0.4556 of
an Allegheny share for each common share held, Pittsburgh-based
Allegheny said today in a statement. The offer is valued at
$46.75 a share based on Allegheny’s closing share price
yesterday, 59 percent more than Ladish’s closing price.  “Our strategy is to build unsurpassed manufacturing
capabilities and develop innovative new products that add value
for our customers,” Allegheny Chief Executive Officer L.
 Patrick Hassey  said in the statement.  Ladish, founded in 1905, makes forged, cast and machined
components for companies including Boeing Co. and United
Technologies Corp.’s Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney units. Airbus
SAS and Boeing, the world’s biggest planemakers, are boosting
production to meet demand for newer, more fuel-efficient
aircraft.  Ladish, based in Cudahy, Wisconsin, climbed $16.09, or 55
percent, to $45.42 at 4:15 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market composite trading.  The shares  have tripled this year.
Allegheny  declined  $1.53, or 3.1 percent, to $48.41 on the New
York Stock Exchange.  The offer values Ladish at 21 times earnings before
interest and tax, compared with the 9.7 median multiple of eight
deals in the same industry in the past nine years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Allegheny said it expects the transaction to close early
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
