Genworth Financial Inc. , the
Richmond, Virginia-based life insurer and mortgage guarantor,
plans to sell $400 million of debt in a boosted offering to help
repay bank debt.  The 10-year senior notes, set to be issued as soon as
today, may yield 7.25 percent, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. The company plans to repay $480 million of
borrowings under two five-year revolving credit lines, Genworth
said today in a regulatory filing that didn’t specify the size,
timing or maturity of the offering.  Genworth, which posted third-quarter profit last month that
missed analysts’ estimates because of costs tied to bad home
loans, is seeking to repay the borrowings in full after paying
down each of the lines by $125 million on Nov. 8, according to
the filing. The weighted-average interest rate under each was
0.61 percent as of Sept. 30, the company said.  The company earlier marketed $300 million of the notes,
said the person, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t set.  Genworth last issued debt in June, its only other bond
offering this year, selling $400 million of 7.7 percent, 10-year
notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That sale was
boosted from $300 million, Bloomberg data show.  The notes may be rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service
and an equivalent BBB by Standard & Poor’s, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
