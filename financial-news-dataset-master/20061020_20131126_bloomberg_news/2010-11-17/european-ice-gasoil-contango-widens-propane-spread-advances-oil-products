Gasoline  in northwest Europe
declined, tracking Brent crude, as  BP Plc  and Trafigura Beheer
BV sold on the barge market. Front-month gasoline crack, or
price spread against crude, widened.  BP Plc , the buyer of a jet fuel cargo yesterday, bought on
the barge market. Glencore International AG sold a gasoline
cargo to Trafigura Beheer BV.  Light Products  Gasoline traded from $736 to $743 a metric ton, according
to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board and the Platts pricing window. Deals were done yesterday
from $744 to $756 a ton.  Total SA  was among the buyers for at least a sixth day for
 Eurobob  grade, to which ethanol is added before being sold to
motorists.  Premium gasoline traded from $740 to $752 a ton, with
Morgan Stanley the main buyer, the survey showed. Yesterday’s
deals were at $750 a ton.  Glencore sold a 10,000-ton cargo to Trafigura at $747 a ton
for delivery to London Thames from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1.  The front-month  gasoline crack  widened after U.S.
 inventories  dropped for a fourth week. Stockpiles fell 2.66
million barrels to 207.7 million, according to the Department of
Energy. The U.S. is an export market for European gasoline.  The crack, a measure of refining profit, widened to $3.40 a
barrel as of 4:35 p.m. London time, from $3.06 yesterday,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd. data on Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel barges advanced relative to December ICE gasoil
futures. BP, the buyer of a jet fuel cargo in the previous
session, paid a premium of $47 a ton to ICE gasoil from Morgan
Stanley for two barge lots. Barge deals were done yesterday at
premiums of $45 and $46 a ton. So-called barges are usually lots
of about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  BP bought a 30,000-ton jet fuel cargo from Vitol Group
yesterday.  Diesel barges advanced relative to ICE gasoil for a second
day. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the availability of
distillate fuels such as diesel may become more restricted in
the “near term” because of demand from China.  “Diesel consumption is leading global oil demand higher,”
analysts led by  Francisco Blanch  in New York said. “The
tightness could persist for a few more months, but we expect the
market to normalize by February.”  Barge deals were done at a premium of $19 and $20 a ton to
the December gasoil contract on ICE. That’s more than
yesterday’s premium of $19 a ton and as little as $15 a ton at
the beginning of the week.  Gasoil for December delivery declined $14.75, or 2 percent,
to $709.25 a ton as of 5:17 p.m. local time.  Europe’s gasoil futures contango widened. Contracts for
December delivery traded at a discount of as much as $5 to
January on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, later narrowing
to $4.75 a barrel. That compares with a discount of $4.50
yesterday and $3 a week ago.  A market is in contango when supplies for nearby delivery
trade at a lower price than shipments for later months. A
widening discount on the front-month contract usually signals a
fall in demand or rise in inventories.  Refinery News  Petroplus Holdings AG  and Tamoil SA said they will close
oil refineries in Europe next year. Tamoil, Libya’s overseas
refiner, plans to convert its 95,000 barrel-a-day Cremona
facility in Italy to a storage depot by the end of 2011, the
company said on Nov. 12.  Petroplus plans to stop operating its 81,000 barrel-a-day
Reichstett plant in France and convert the site into a terminal,
the Zug, Switzerland-based company said Oct. 21.  Mol Nyrt., Hungary’s largest refiner, plans to shut
gasoline and diesel units at four refineries next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
