Metorex Ltd. headed for its biggest
two-day decline since May after the company said output at its
Ruashi copper and cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of
Congo was cut by electrical faults.  The stock fell as much as 23 cents, or 5 percent, to 4.35
rand and traded at 4.38 rand as of 9:26 a.m. in Johannesburg,
bringing its two-day decline to 9.3 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
