VeriFone Systems Inc. , the second-
largest maker of electronic payment equipment, agreed to buy
 Hypercom Corp.  for $485 million in stock to help it expand in
European markets. Hypercom jumped to its highest in four years.  The $7.32 per share sale price represents a 19 percent
premium over Hypercom’s closing  share price  yesterday of $6.13.
VeriFone, based in San Jose, California, will assume Hypercom’s
net debt, according to a statement today.  Hypercom  gained  $1, or 16 percent, to $7.13 at 4:03 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite  trading , its highest value
since November 2006. VeriFone rose $1.07, or 3.4 percent, to
$32.91.  VeriFone had previously offered $5.25-per-share, a bid
rejected by Hypercom’s board of directors in October.  Hypercom boosted sales by 24 percent in the third quarter
to $125.1 million, including a 21 percent gain in revenue from
Europe, according to a Nov. 2 statement. The Scottsdale,
Arizona-based company is the third-largest maker of point-of-
sale equipment.  Ingenico SA , the largest company in the market, offered
$6.25-a-share in cash for Hypercom in February 2008. The
Neuilly-Sur-Seine, France-based manufacturer dropped its bid as
Hypercom pushed ahead with a purchase of a unit of Thales SA.  Hypercom shareholders would receive 0.23 shares of VeriFone
stock for every share they hold in Hypercom. The transaction is
expected to close in next year’s second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
