Nigerian inflation slowed for the
second consecutive month in October as a good harvest in the
West African nation damped food prices.  The inflation rate fell to 13.4 percent from 13.6 percent
in September, the Abuja-based  National Bureau of Statistics  said
in a statement today. Food costs rose an annual 14.1 percent,
compared with 14.6 percent a month earlier.  The harvesting season reached its peak during the period,
“putting downward pressures on food prices,” Alan Cameron, an
analyst at London-based Business Monitor International, said by
e-mail. “Weather conditions over the summer were for the most
part positive and the harvest is yielding good results.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria , which is targeting inflation
of less than 10 percent, raised its key lending rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 6.25 percent on Sept. 21. Plans
to buy toxic debt from commercial banks and increased government
spending before elections next year may add to pressure on
prices, bank Governor Lamido Sanusi.  Food accounts for 50.7 percent of the consumer price index
in Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer and the continent’s most
populous country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
