Barloworld Ltd. , the world’s largest
forklift dealer, posted a full-year loss as the global economic
recession slashed sales of earth-moving vehicles, autos and
demand for car rentals.  The loss was 7 million rand ($992,000) in the 12 months
through September, compared with a profit of 671 million rand a
year earlier, the company said in a statement today. Revenue
dropped 10 percent to 40.8 billion rand.  “We were impacted by difficult trading conditions in most
of our markets,” the company said. “We have, however, seen a
noticeable improvement in trading conditions toward the back end
of our financial year.”  Barloworld, based in Johannesburg, in July sold its
Scandinavian car-rental business for 1.1 billion rand after it
decided in 2008 that the unit was not “core” and used the
proceeds to pay down debt. The company will sell freight-
forwarding units next year to improve profitability, it said.  The company also agreed to pay $52 million for the 50
percent it doesn’t already own in Vostochnaya Technica, a
Russian dealership that sells Caterpillar equipment, according
to a separate statement issued earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
