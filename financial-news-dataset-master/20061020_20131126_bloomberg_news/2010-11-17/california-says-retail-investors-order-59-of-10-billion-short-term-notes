California  wraps up its $10 billion
short-term note sale to bolster cash today, after taking orders
for 59 percent of the debt from individual investors, down from
a record last year.  In two days limited to retail sales, the $5.89 billion in
orders included $822.7 million of notes maturing in May, with
yields quoted at 1.25 percent, and $5.07 billion that mature in
June at 1.5 percent,  Tom Dresslar , spokesman for Treasurer  Bill Lockyer , said yesterday by e-mail. Institutional investors will
be offered the securities today, and final prices will be set.  State and local governments across the U.S. this week are
offering the most debt in at least seven years, a glut that
helped send yields on 10-year  top-rated tax-exempt  bonds to a
four-month high.  Top-rated one-year municipal bonds  rose 0.05
percentage point yesterday to 0.5 percent, the highest yield
since June 24, according to Municipal Market Advisors data.  “We launched this sale in some pretty rough waters,”
Dresslar said in the statement. “Given the market conditions,
we’re pleased with the retail demand.”  The quoted yield on notes maturing in May is 75 basis
points, or 0.75 percentage point, more than top-rated one-year
notes and 100 basis points more for the June notes, according to
MMA data. During the first day of this year’s sale, the state
had quoted investors 1 percent to 1.25 percent for the May notes
and 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent for those coming due in June.  When California offered $8.8 billion of similar notes last
year, it was able to sell 75 percent to retail investors at the
low end of the quoted yield range.  The 2009 notes that matured in May were priced to yield
1.25 percent, or about 59 basis points more than top-rated one-
year bonds, according to MMA data. Notes that came due in June
were priced to yield 1.5 percent, or 84 basis points more. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The sale follows a Nov. 10 report that projected a $25.4
billion deficit for the state over the next 19 months, including
$6.1 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
