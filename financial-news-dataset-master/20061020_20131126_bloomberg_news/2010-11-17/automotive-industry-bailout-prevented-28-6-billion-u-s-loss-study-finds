The U.S. government avoided a $28.6
billion loss and saved more than 1.14 million jobs by bailing
out the automotive industry, a research group said today.  The loss would have been caused by increased public welfare
payments and lost tax receipts from workers had the government
not provided  $82 billion  of assistance to the industry, said
 Kristin Dziczek , director of the labor industry group at the
Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The  study  was released as  General Motors Co. , which
received $49.5 billion in U.S. aid, prepares an initial public
offering to help pay back the Treasury Department. The
government also provided $13 billion of assistance to Chrysler
Group LLC and $17 billion to automotive lender GMAC Inc., which
later became Ally Financial Inc.  “This economy would be a big pile of dust at the moment”
had the government chosen not to save the banks and auto
companies, said  Steven Rattner , the former head of the U.S.
Automotive Task Force.  The government may lose $5 billion to $7 billion on its
rescue of t he auto industry, Rattner said today in a Bloomberg
Radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.  “Anything in that range is gravy, because we would have
had to spend or lost so much more,” Dziczek said today in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
