Copper fell to a seven-week low in
New York as China, the world’s largest consumer of the metal,
moved to limit inflation, potentially eroding demand.  China’s government may impose temporary price controls on
“important daily necessities” and production materials to
counter the fastest inflation in two years, the cabinet
confirmed. The Shanghai Composite Index of equities slid to the
lowest close in almost a month. Copper also dropped as European
finance ministers began work on possible aid for Irish banks.  “Concerns over China’s tightening plus euro-zone woes are
driving the market,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB
Capital in London.  Copper for delivery in March declined 4.35 cents, or 1.2
percent to $3.6875 a pound at 8:04 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Copper for delivery in three months slid 0.7 percent to
$8,095 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange. Prices reached
$3.611 and $7,920, the lowest intraday levels since Sept. 28.  LME copper may decline as low as $7,600 a ton depending on
developments in Europe and aid to Irish banks,  Charles Cooper ,
an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd. in London, said by
telephone. Prices above $8,000 deterred end-user buyers, he
said.  European Union and International Monetary Fund experts will
start scanning the books of Ireland’s debt-laden banks tomorrow
in a prelude to a possible aid package to stem Europe’s widening
fiscal crisis.  Borrowing Costs  China’s central bank may raise interest rates as soon as
Nov. 19 because of inflationary pressure, the China Securities
Journal said today. Inflation in the country climbed to a two-
year high of 4.4 percent in October.  A Chinese consumer-confidence index fell for the first time
in six quarters on expectations that prices of goods and
services will keep increasing, according to a statement from
Nielsen Co. and the Chinese statistics bureau’s Economic
Monitoring and Analysis Center.  The  LME index  of the six main industrial metals traded on
the exchange yesterday slumped 6.3 percent, the most since May
4, as zinc plunged 8.5 percent.  “We see short-term weakness, followed by a rebound in
metal prices going into the last part of the first half next
year,” Oriel’s Cooper said. Copper supply will fall short of
demand by 380,000 tons next year, he said.  Zinc for three-month delivery on the LME today slid 2
percent to $2,096.25 a ton, rebounding from a retreat of as much
as 5.6 percent.  Tin dropped 0.7 percent to $24,350 a ton. Prices reached a
record $27,500 on Nov. 9. The metal has jumped 44 percent this
year, leading LME advances, after production was disrupted in
Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Aluminum rose 0.6 percent to $2,255 a ton and nickel added
2.7 percent to $21,380 a ton. Lead dropped 0.6 percent to
$2,241.75 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
