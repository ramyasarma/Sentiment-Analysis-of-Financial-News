Corn and soybeans fell to five-week
lows in Chicago on concern that demand may wane as China, the
biggest consumer of commodities, moves to limit speculation and
inflation.  China’s government may impose temporary price controls on
“important daily necessities,” the cabinet confirmed today.
The  Dalian  exchange said last week it would curb “abnormal”
trading to prevent price manipulation. Prices also dropped today
as the dollar strengthened for a third day, making U.S. crops
more expensive for importers, before erasing the gain.  “Talk of China curbing speculation and a stronger dollar
is working against the ags,” said  Luke Chandler , global head of
agricultural-markets research for Rabobank in London. “We still
remain supportive of the grain markets. There’s just some
momentum to the downside.”  Corn for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade slid
3 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $5.37 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London
time. The grain reached $5.22, the lowest level for a most-
active contract since Oct. 8, after yesterday declining by as
much as the exchange limit of 30 cents.  Soybeans for January delivery dropped 12.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $12.0725 a bushel after touching $11.7525, the
lowest price since Oct. 12. The oilseed tumbled yesterday by as
much as the exchange limit of 70 cents.  Smaller Crop  Corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 a bushel on Nov. 9
after adverse weather reduced the size of the U.S. crop.
Soybeans touched $13.485 on Nov. 12, the highest price since
Aug. 28, 2008.  A Chinese consumer-confidence index fell for the first time
in six quarters because of concern about inflation, according to
a statement from Nielsen Co. and the Chinese statistics bureau’s
Economic Monitoring and Analysis Center.  “China has poured cold water over the market that went up
on concern about tight supply,” said  Han Sung Min , a broker at
Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul.  Wheat for March delivery gained 9.75 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $6.745 a bushel, erasing a drop to the lowest price since
Oct. 6. The world crop of the grain will fall 5.1 percent and
global cereals output will drop 2.1 percent, the United Nations’
Food and Agriculture Organization said today.  Russia’s grain crop slid 38 percent from a year earlier to
62.7 million metric tons, the government said. The harvest was
76 percent complete at the beginning of November, the Federal
Statistics Service said.  Milling wheat for January delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 1.4 percent to 213 euros ($287) a ton.  Rough rice for January delivery fell 8.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $13.19 per 100 pounds in Chicago. The grain touched
$12.97, the lowest level since Oct. 8, after plunging 50 cents
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
