The Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, the largest U.S. transit agency, increased its
projected deficit in 2012-14 by $416 million because it expects
lower returns on its investments.  The deficit will be $649 million in the period versus an
earlier projection of $233 million, the agency’s chief financial
officer said in a presentation in New York today.  Expected investment returns will be 7.5 percent compared
with 8 percent projected earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
