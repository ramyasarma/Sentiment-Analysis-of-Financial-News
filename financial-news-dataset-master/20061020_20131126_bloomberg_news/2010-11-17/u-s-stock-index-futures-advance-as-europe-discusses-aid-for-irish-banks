U.S. stocks rose, with the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  rebounding from its biggest drop since August,
as slower-than-expected inflation helped bolster the Federal
Reserve’s decision to buy Treasuries and European officials
negotiated aid for Ireland.  Target Corp.  advanced 3.4 percent as the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer posted a 23 percent jump in third-quarter
profit after its credit-card unit doubled earnings.  Merck & Co. 
had the biggest gain the Dow Jones Industrial Average, rising
1.5 percent, after saying an experimental drug raised levels of
good cholesterol.  GameStop Corp.  climbed 2.1 percent as Credit
Suisse Group AG boosted the rating for the world’s largest
video-game retailer to “outperform.”  The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent to 1,181.38 at 1:53 p.m. in
New York, after earlier slumping as much as 0.2 percent. The 30-
stock  Dow  was little changed at 11,024.79.  “It’s a relief bounce,” said  Bruce McCain , who oversees
$25 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-
banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. “In the absence of bad
news out of Europe and China, we’re getting a rebound. In the
U.S., there are two ways of reading the recent data, including
today’s CPI. One could say -- the headline number doubled and
the Fed’s move was silly. Others would say -- hey, the core
number is not that good, so the Fed action was necessary.”  The S&P 500 had its biggest slump since Aug. 19 yesterday
amid speculation that the debt crisis in Europe is worsening and
that China will act to slow its economy. The U.S. benchmark
 index  has still jumped 15 percent since July 2 as the Fed
increased its program of asset purchases to stimulate growth and
companies reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Debt Crisis  Stock futures held their gains as the consumer-price index
increased 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent rise the prior month,
the Labor Department said today in Washington. A 0.3 percent
gain was forecast by economists, according to the median
projection in a Bloomberg News survey. Excluding food and fuel,
so-called core costs increased 0.6 percent from October 2009,
the smallest gain on record.  A separate report showed housing starts fell to a 519,000
annual rate, the fewest since a record low reached in April 2009
and down 12 percent from a revised 588,000 in September that was
less than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said.  “Both data are consistent with what the Fed has been
saying,” said  Stephen Wood , the New York-based chief market
strategist for Russell Investments, which manages $140 billion.
“It doesn’t give investors reason to question the policy.”  ‘Thank You’  Warren Buffett , the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
wrote an open “thank-you” letter in today’s New York Times,
saying the U.S. government’s intervention in the financial
crisis had stopped many companies from going under, saved
millions of jobs and restored calm.  Separately, in a CNBC interview, Buffett said the current
government spending can be considered stimulus. He also said the
economy will be “far ahead of where we are now in four to five
years,” and that the U.S. needs to get the deficit down to
“not more than 3% of GDP.”  The  MSCI World Index  rose for the first time in eight days
as European Union and International Monetary Fund experts will
start scanning the books of Ireland’s debt-laden banks tomorrow
in a prelude to a possible aid package to stem Europe’s widening
fiscal crisis. Finance chiefs from the 16-country euro area said
the assessment will determine whether Ireland can patch up the
banking system on its own or needs to fall back on the EU-IMF
750 billion-euro ($1 trillion) rescue fund.  Consumer Companies  A measure of companies that rely on  consumer discretionary 
spending rose 0.7 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P 500 among
10 industries.  Target  climbed 3.4 percent to $55.64. Net income rose to
$535 million, or 74 cents a share, in the three months ended Oct.
30, from $436 million, or 58 cents, a year earlier. Excluding a
tax gain, profit was 68 cents a share, matching the average of
20 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.   Merck  climbed 1.5 percent to $34.62. The company’s
experimental drug, anacetrapib, raised levels of good
cholesterol, lowered bad cholesterol and may have helped
patients avert heart complications, without the safety risks
that prompted Pfizer Inc. to abandon a similar product four
years ago, according to a study funded by Merck.   GameStop  rallied 2.1 percent to $21.29. The world’s
largest video-game retailer was boosted to “outperform” from
“neutral” by Credit Suisse, which cited the company’s
improving earnings outlook and “strong cash flow.”  Automakers  Car companies rose 1.4 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P
500 among 24 industries. Ford Motor Co. advanced 1.6 percent to
$16.78, extending its rally to 70 percent from this year’s low
on June 29.  General Motors Co. ’s initial public offering may raise
$15.8 billion after the U.S. Treasury and United Auto Workers’
retiree health-care trust increased the shares they are selling,
according to a regulatory filing.  The IPO was expanded by 31 percent to 478 million shares,
GM said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a day after boosting the offer price to as much as
$33 a share. An overallotment and an offering of preferred
shares may increase the total amount raised to about $22.7
billion. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.’s  $22.1 billion  initial
sale is the largest common-stock IPO in history.  Analysts are raising their estimates of 2011 revenue at
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies for the first time in six
months, encouraging investors betting that stocks will rally.  Sales will climb 5.7 percent to $1,014.08 a share next year,
according to the average estimate as of Nov. 15. The forecast
had fallen every month since May, when it rose to a 2010 high of
$1,034.24 a share. The projected growth rate is 1.8 percentage
points higher than the average since 1993, Bloomberg data show.  Homebuilders  The  S&P 500 Supercomposite Homebuilding Index  slumped 1.7
percent, as 11 of its 12 members declined, after housing starts
dropped more than forecast.  D.R. Horton Inc. declined 3.1 percent to $10.68. PulteGroup
Inc. slumped 3.7 percent to $6.34.  Solar shares declined after Credit Suisse cut the
industry’s recommendation to “market weight” from
“overweight,” saying subsidy-driven demand can’t keep up with
surging supply.  First Solar Inc. lost 4.7 percent to $124.53. JA Solar
Holdings Co. dropped 4 percent to $7.54.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. slid 8.6 percent to $7.62.
China’s largest solar panel maker reported net income for the
third quarter of $33.1 million, or 18 cents per American
depositary receipt. That’s lower than the 23-cent average
estimate of 21 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Regions Financial Corp.  dropped 5.7 percent to $5.58.
Alabama’s biggest bank had its credit rating cut for the second
time this month by Moody’s Investors Service after the lender
ousted three managers who oversaw risk and souring assets. The
firm’s senior debt rating was lowered two notches to Ba3 from
Ba1, Moody’s said in a statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
