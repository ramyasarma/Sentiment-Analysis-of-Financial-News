Copper prices in London rebounded
from the biggest loss in six months as gains in U.S. equities
bolstered the economic outlook. Nickel climbed.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  gained for the first time
in five sessions as European officials negotiate aid for Ireland
to stem the region’s widening fiscal crisis. The  dollar  fell as
much as 0.4 percent against a six-currency basket, increasing
the appeal of commodities as alternative investments.  “The market is breathing a sigh of relief,” said  Matt Zeman , a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
“The dollar is making new lows for the day and equities are
higher. Copper is moving on the macroeconomic news today.”  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added $40, or 0.5 percent, to $8,190 a metric ton ($3.71
a pound) at 6:33 p.m. local time. Yesterday, the price dropped
5.7 percent, the most since May 17.  In New York, copper futures for March delivery rose 0.3
cent to $3.734 a pound on the Comex.  Failing to contain Ireland’s fiscal woes may drive the
metal to $4 in two weeks, Zeman said. If the situation escalates
and China raises interest rates, the price may fall to $3.60, he
said.  Nickel prices jumped as much as 5.1 percent in London. The
metal rallied on speculation that a potential military coup in
Madagascar will delay supplies from the $4.65 billion Ambatovy
mine.  “People dislike uncertainty,” said  David Thurtell , an
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in London.  Nickel for delivery in three months added $730, or 3.5
percent, to $21,550 a ton on the LME, the biggest gain since
Nov. 4.  Also in London, aluminum, lead and tin rallied. Zinc fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
