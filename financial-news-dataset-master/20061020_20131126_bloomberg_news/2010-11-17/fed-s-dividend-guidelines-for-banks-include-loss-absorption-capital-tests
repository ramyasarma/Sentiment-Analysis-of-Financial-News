The Federal Reserve said it will
examine large bank holding companies’ ability to absorb losses
and meet new capital requirements when deciding whether firms
may increase dividends and buy back shares.  Banks must meet a “number of criteria,” including whether
they can absorb losses under adverse economic conditions and how
they will meet Basel III capital rules, the Fed said today in a
statement. Companies must repay or replace any government
investment with preferred or common stock before raising payouts
or repurchasing stock, it said.  The Fed expects to begin responding to requests in next
year’s first quarter, it said. It is asking large banks to
submit capital plans by early 2011, regardless of whether they
plan to raise dividends or buy back stock.  Concerns that bank capital was under pressure from souring
loans prompted Fed officials in February 2009 to issue a letter
to its regional supervisors telling them banks “should reduce
or eliminate dividends” when earnings decline or the economic
outlook deteriorates. The new guidelines may show the Fed’s
confidence in banks’ health is being restored.  Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Financial Officer  Howard Atkins ,
59, said last month that a dividend increase is a “top
priority” for the bank. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon , 54, said he was “reasonably hopeful” the
firm will be able to raise its payment in 2011’s first quarter
and that regulators were open to the idea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
