Deacons , a Kenyan clothing and home-
products retailer, may begin trading by introduction on the
 Nairobi Stock Exchange  before the end of next year, Chief
Executive Officer Muchiri Wahome said.  “The board is very committed to a listing” within 12
months from Nov. 30, 2010, Wahome told reporters today in
Nairobi, the capital.  “We will expand the store footprint
within Kenya and the region particularly Uganda and Rwanda,”
Wahome said. The company presently has 23 outlets in Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania, he said.  Deacons has distribution agreements with South African
retailers including  Mr Price Group Ltd. , Truworths International
Ltd., Woolworths Holdings Ltd., and with German sporting-goods
maker  Adidas AG . Its own brands include 4U2, Angelo and Life
Fitness, according to the statement. The company began
operations in 1958 with a distribution agreement for Marks &
Spencer Group Plc in East Africa for 22 years.  In the year through December, Deacons posted net income of
79.6 million shillings ($1 million) and is forecast to grow to
149 million shillings in the year through December 2010.  The company plans to sell 12.8 million shares, or 39.48
percent of its stock, to the public at 62.50 shillings each to
raise 800 million shillings, according to a statement handed to
reporters by the company.  The offer opens today and will close Nov. 30, it said. The
company, which currently has 18 shareholders, is hoping to grow
its share register to 1,500, which is one of the listing
requirements, Chairman Peter Njoka told reporters.  A private placement by Deacons in 2006 at an offer price of
30 shillings a share raised 118 million shillings, Wahome said.
The two biggest shareholders in the company are Swedfund
International Akitebolag, with a stake of 19.45 percent and
Pinpoint Investment Ltd., with a holding of 12.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
