Home prices in the U.K. will fall
about 1 percent next year as the government slashes spending,
 Jones Lang LaSalle Inc . said, cutting its previous estimate.  Prices in London will gain about 2 percent, fueled by
overseas buyers, the Chicago-based property broker said in a
report today. In August, JLL estimated that prices in the whole
of the country would be unchanged next year.  The government’s plan to eliminate almost 500,000 jobs by
2015 will cause “turmoil” in the property market in the short
term, according to JLL, the world’s second-largest commercial
real-estate broker. Prices fell by 1.5 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three months.  “Confidence in the market has been ebbing away,” Rob
Bruce, head of JLL’s residential research in the U.K., said in
an interview. “Until there is more clarity, people will sit on
the sidelines. There is a lot of bedding down to be done with
the new austerity measures, although the longer-term outlook is
encouraging.”  Northern Ireland, the West Midlands and Scotland will have
the biggest declines next year will be in because a greater
proportion of people there are employed by the state, JLL said.
London and the south of the country will lead the recovery
starting in 2012.  Prices in the U.K. capital will rise by about 8 percent a
year from 2012 to 2014, and 5 percent in the Midlands and
northern England, JLL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
