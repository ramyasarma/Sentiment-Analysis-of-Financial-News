Deutsche Bank AG raised its estimate
for how many coal and natural-gas power stations may close by
2014 as Europe begins charging utilities for carbon permits.  The bank forecast that an additional 4 to 5 gigawatts of
power-generating capacity will be closed compared with the 17.6
gigawatts originally estimated, analysts led by Mark Lewis in
Paris and Martin Brough in London said today in an e-mail.  Full auctioning of European Union emission allowances “will
force coal and gas-fired generators to think about higher levels
of closures over 2011-2014 than the 17.6 gigawatts assumed in
our model,” the note said. “Many older, less efficient coal
and gas plants will not be able to cover their fixed-operating
costs once they have to pay for 100% of their EU allowances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
