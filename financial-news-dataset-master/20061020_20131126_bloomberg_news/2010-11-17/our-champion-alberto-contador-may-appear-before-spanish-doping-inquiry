Tour de France champion  Alberto Contador  may appear before a Spanish cycling federation panel
next week when lawyers present his defense in a doping inquiry,
Andy Ramos, one of the attorneys, said.  The federation on Nov. 8 was asked to investigate after the
rider tested positive for what the ruling body, Union Cycliste
Internationale, called “very small” traces of clenbuterol in a
urine sample given four days before winning his third Tour on
July 25. Contador, 27, blames the irregularity on contaminated
beef he ate.  Contador’s lawyers haven’t decided yet whether the rider
will accompany them, Ramos said in a phone interview from his
office in Madrid. Spanish federation spokesman Luis Roman said a
four-man panel is in charge of the case, adding he couldn’t
provide details of the inquiry.  According to a report in  El Pais  today, Contador’s defense
has been “hit” after World Anti-Doping Agency investigators
found no contamination at the shop and slaughter-house that
supplied the beef to his team. Ramos said “some of the
information” in the newspaper report is correct but the story’s
conclusion is wrong.  Clenbuterol treats respiratory disorders such as asthma and
can increase aerobic capacity by improving the flow of oxygen in
the bloodstream. Farmers sometimes use it illegally to bulk up
cattle.  If found guilty, Contador could be stripped of his victory
and banned for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
