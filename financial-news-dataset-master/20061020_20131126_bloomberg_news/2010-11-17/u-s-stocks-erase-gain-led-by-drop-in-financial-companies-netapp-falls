U.S. stocks erased a rally as banks
fell and NetApp Inc. forecast less profit than analysts
estimated.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,178.62 at 3:10 p.m. in New York after advancing as much as
0.4 percent. NetApp plunged 6.5 percent before trading was
halted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
