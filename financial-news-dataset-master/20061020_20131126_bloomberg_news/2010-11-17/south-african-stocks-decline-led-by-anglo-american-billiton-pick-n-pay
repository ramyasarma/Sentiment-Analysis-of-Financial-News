index, dropped 4.69 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 324.31 rand, a
second day of decreases. Copper declined as much as 2.8 percent
to $7,920 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange on

rand. The lender also agreed a $268 million, three-year loan in
Taiwan with a group of banks led by Bank of Taiwan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
