Warner Bros. said it’s investigating
the leak of a portion of the new “Harry Potter” film on
Internet file-sharing sites ahead of the movie’s Nov. 19
premiere.  “This constitutes a serious breach of copyright violation
and theft of Warner Bros. property,” the film studio, owned by
New York-based  Time Warner Inc. , said in an e-mailed statement
today. “We are vigorously investigating this matter and will
prosecute those involved to the full extent of the law.”  The first 36 minutes of “Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows - Part 1” were made available for download on sites
such as BitTorrent this week, according to  TorrentFreak , a blog
that follows file-sharing news. Warner Bros. said it is working
to restrict and remove the stolen and illegal copies on the Web.  The “Harry Potter” franchise has brought in $5.42 billion
in worldwide ticket sales from the first six movies, according
to Box Office Mojo, a research firm based in Sherman Oaks,
California. Film studios have urged the government to step up
the fight against piracy, which Hollywood executives say costs
the U.S. economy more than $20 billion a year. In June, the U.S.
government seized nine websites that allegedly traffic in
illegal movie downloads.  The latest installment of “Harry Potter,” the first of a
two-part finale, is scheduled to premiere in U.S. theaters in
two days. The final movie will be released July 15, 2011.  Time Warner  was unchanged at $30.54 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 4.8
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
