Copper, sugar and rubber futures
slumped their daily limit in China, with copper set for its
biggest four-day slide since 2008, on speculation the government
will take steps to cool inflation, damping commodity demand.  Copper for February delivery dropped 5 percent, the maximum
allowed by the Shanghai Futures Exchange, to 61,550 yuan ($9,259)
per metric ton before trading at 61,560 yuan. Soybeans fell 4
percent and cotton, sugar and rubber declined 5 percent.  China is drafting measures to curb excessive price gains,
Premier Wen Jiabao said yesterday, suggesting the government may
raise interest rates and introduce price controls.  Inflation  in
October was 4.4 percent, boosted by a 10.1 percent increase in
food costs, statistics bureau data show. The futures exchanges
have already announced moves to cool speculation.  “The precipitous fall indicates investors have become
increasingly risk-averse, as the strong rally in the past few
months seems vulnerable,” Wang Ning, an analyst at Xiangyu
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  Commodities worldwide capped the biggest five-session slide
since July 2009 yesterday. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials fell 3.2 percent to 296.22, bringing
its decline since Nov. 9 to 7.2 percent. Three-month copper lost
0.3 percent to $8,124 a ton today on the London Metal Exchange
after tumbling 5.7 percent yesterday.  Investor Retreat  A Chinese consumer confidence index fell for the first time
in six quarters on expectations that the price of goods and
services will keep increasing. The measure dropped to 104 in the
third quarter from 109 in the previous three months, according
to a statement from Nielsen Co. and the Chinese statistics
bureau’s Economic Monitoring and Analysis Center.  “What I’ve seen was a lot of liquidation of long positions
as investors retreat from the market and wait until they get a
clearer macro picture,” Wang said.  Soybean futures jumped as much as 12 percent in Dalian this
month and dropped 9.2 percent in the past four days, the biggest
such decline since October 2008. Rubber soared as much as 28
percent in Shanghai, and fell 12 percent in the past four days,
the most since December 2008.  Copper futures in Shanghai declined 10.4 percent in the
past four sessions, heading for the biggest four-day slide since
December 2008. Zinc slid 15 percent in the period, and was
poised for the largest drop since November 2007.  Rate Speculation  China’s central bank may raise rates as soon as Nov. 19
because of sustained inflationary pressure, the China Securities
Journal said today. Earlier announcements also indicate that
rate decisions are often released on Fridays or around the 20th
of the month, the newspaper reported.  Exchanges have introduced measures to cool speculation. The
Dalian bourse said last week it will curb “abnormal” trading
to prevent price manipulation and other activities that disrupt
an orderly market. The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and Shanghai
Futures Exchange have announced similar steps.  Stocks in China declined, with the Shanghai Composite Index,
which tracks the bigger of China’s stock exchanges, down 1.3
percent to 2,856.96. Aluminum in London gained 0.5 percent to
$2,254 a ton, while zinc declined 1.8 percent to $2,100 a ton.  Corn for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell
as much as 3.3 percent to $5.22 a bushel today, the lowest level
for the most-active contract since Oct. 8, and traded at $5.29.  -- Helen Sun ,  William Bi . Editor:  James Poole   To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
