CPC Corp., Taiwan’s state-owned oil
company, said a fire at its Kaohsiung refinery in the island’s
south has been extinguished without any impact on operations.  The fire occurred on a pipeline away from the plant’s main
area and didn’t cause any disruption, CPC Vice-President Paul
Chen said by phone.  Two contract workers suffered “slight” burns in the
incident and have been treated in hospital and discharged, Chen
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
