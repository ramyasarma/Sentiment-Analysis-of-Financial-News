Digital rights to the back catalog
of Beatles songs, won by Apple Inc.’s iTunes, were also sought
by Google Inc. and Amazon.Com Inc., the New York Post reported,
citing unidentified people in the music business.  Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.’s EMI Group owns the
Beatles’ master recordings and the Beatles’ business affairs are
run by Apple Corps Ltd., the newspaper said, adding that EMI
declined to comment on the transaction.   Terra Firma, which borrowed billions of dollars to buy EMI
in 2007, won’t escape from its debt predicament as a result of
the agreement with Apple Inc., the Post said, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
