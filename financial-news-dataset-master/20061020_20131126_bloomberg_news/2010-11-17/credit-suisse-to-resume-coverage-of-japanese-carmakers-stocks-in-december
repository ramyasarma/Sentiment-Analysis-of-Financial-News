Credit Suisse Group AG will resume
coverage of seven Japanese carmakers in December, said  Kunihiko Shiohara , managing director and head of equity research at the
brokerage in Tokyo.  Coverage of the automakers has been halted since July 2009
and will resume to meet client demand, Shiohara said yesterday
in an interview in Tokyo.  The brokerage also plans to start covering electronic parts
manufacturers, providers of social networking services and games,
and electric power and gas suppliers this year, aiming to expand
its coverage of Japanese companies to about 260 from 228 by the
end of this year and to about 300 by the middle of 2011,
Shiohara said.  Shiohara was a partner and analyst covering carmakers at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before joining Credit Suisse in July
2009.  To contact the reporters on the story:
