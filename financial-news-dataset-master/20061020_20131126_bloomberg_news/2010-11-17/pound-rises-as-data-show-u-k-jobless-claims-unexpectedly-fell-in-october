The pound strengthened against the
euro and stayed higher versus the dollar after data showed U.K.
jobless claims fell in October.  The U.K. currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 84.78 pence
per euro and gained 0.3 percent to $1.5933 as of 9:35 a.m. in
London.  The number of people receiving jobless benefits declined by
3,700 from September to 1.47 million, the first decline since
July, the Office for National Statistics said. The median
forecast of 23 economists was for a rise of 6,000.  A separate report showed the Bank of England’s Monetary
Policy Committee split three ways for a second month as some
officials became more concerned that Britain’s bout of inflation
will dislodge price expectations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
