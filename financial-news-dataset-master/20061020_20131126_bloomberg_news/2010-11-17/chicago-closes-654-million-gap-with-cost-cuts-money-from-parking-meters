Chicago, the third most-populous
U.S. city, passed Mayor  Richard M. Daley’s  2011 budget by
closing a $654 million deficit with cost cuts and money from
leasing parking meters.  The City Council approved the budget 43-7, according to a
 news release  today. Daley presented a $6.1 billion budget to the
council Oct. 13. The 68-year-old Democrat announced Sept. 7 that
he wouldn’t seek a seventh term after 21 years in office.  The worst recession since the 1930s reduced Chicago’s
revenue by more than $1 billion, Daley said, forcing the city to
dip into reserves and cut spending. The city didn’t raise taxes
or fees to close the 2011 budget gap, the release today said.  “The nation’s recession is the biggest reason we -- and
every other city and state -- continue to face major financial
challenges,” Daley said in the release.  The 2011 budget cuts 277 jobs, saving $13 million, and
continues the freeze on hiring in non-public-safety departments,
saving $20 million, the news release said.  It requires all non-union employees, including the mayor,
to take furlough days and unpaid holidays to save $20 million.
Similar actions for some union employees will save $32 million.  The city will borrow $120 million from funds it got when it
leased its parking-meter system to an investor group led by
Morgan Stanley in 2008. The city received a $1.15 billion lump
sum in the transaction, which the mayor has used to help balance
previous budgets.  Chicago had to borrow $60 million less from parking-meter
lease funds last year to balance the 2010 budget, the news
release said. That amount will be applied to the 2011 budget.
After the borrowing, $76 million will remain in the parking
meter accounts, the mayor’s release said.  Standard & Poor’s cut Chicago’s credit rating on Nov. 5 by
one level to A+, the fifth-highest investment grade, citing the
city’s reliance on cash reserves to balance its budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
