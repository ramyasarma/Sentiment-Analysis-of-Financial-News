Houston Texans quarterback  Matt Schaub  is expected to play in this weekend’s game against the
New York Jets after spending last night in a hospital with a
knee injury, coach  Gary Kubiak  said.  Schaub remained in the hospital today and missed practice
while undergoing treatment for a bursa sac injury.  Kubiak, who didn’t disclose specifics of the injury, said
he’s optimistic Schaub will play Nov. 21 against the Jets at New
Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Schaub ranks
seventh in the National Football League with 2,320 passing yards
this season.  “We put him in the hospital to treat it basically and get
some rest to get off of it,” Kubiak said at a  news conference .
The Texans “made a decision this morning to let him stay there
all day. (He) should be getting out here at some point and be
able to (practice) tomorrow.”  Dan Orlovsky  and  Matt Leinart  are the Texans’ backup
quarterbacks.  Knee joints are surrounded by three major bursa sacs, which
help reduce friction between tissues of the body. When a bursa
becomes inflamed, the condition is known as bursitis. When
infected, it’s known as septic bursitis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
