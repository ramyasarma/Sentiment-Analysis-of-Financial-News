Japanese  stocks  rose, led by
automakers on a weaker yen. Commodity-related shares slid after
oil and metal prices plunged on concern China’s measures to cool
inflation will slow global growth.  Mazda Motor Corp. , Japan’s second-largest car exporter
climbed 3.1 percent after companies agreed to buy its shares
from Ford Motor Co. Bridgestone Corp., the nation’s No. 1 tire
maker that gets more than 75 percent of its sales overseas,
gained 3.4 percent. Mitsubishi Materials Corp., a non-ferrous
metal producer, tumbled 4 percent. Komatsu Ltd., a maker of
earth movers that gets about 20 percent of its revenue in China,
lost 0.5 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.2 percent to 9,811.66
at the 3 p.m. market close in Tokyo after falling as much as 1.1
percent. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.3 percent to 850.30
with three stocks advancing for every two that retreated.  “Japanese stocks, which had declined because of a lack of
confidence in earnings, are on their way to catching up with
other markets,” as the yen weakens, said  Masaru Hamasaki , who
helps oversee about $17 billion as chief strategist in Tokyo at
Toyota Asset Management Co. “Once the yen falls below the 85
yen level, confidence for corporate earnings should rise and
shares should advance.”  The Topix has dropped 6.3 percent this year, compared with
gains of 5.7 percent by the S&P 500 and 4.8 percent by the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese benchmark are valued at
15 times estimated  earnings , compared with 13.9 times for the
S&P 500 and 12 times for the Stoxx 600.  Automakers Climb  The yen depreciated to 83.59 against the dollar about 3 a.m.
in Tokyo today, the weakest level since Oct. 5. That boosts the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  Automakers advanced after the Nikkei English News said Ford
Motor Co. agreed to sell Mazda shares to companies including
Itochu Corp. and Kajima Corp.  Mazda jumped 3.1 percent to 231 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
the world’s largest carmaker, gained 0.5 percent to 3,170 yen.
Honda Motor Co., Japan’s No. 2 carmaker, rose 2 percent to 3,085
yen and was the biggest support for the Nikkei and the Topix.  “Foreign investors had seen Japanese stocks as
underperformers but they are revising their asset allocation of
Japanese stocks,” after the trend of the yen’s strengthening
stopped,  Gentoku Kiyokawa , operating officer at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners in Tokyo.  Bridgestone Gains  Bridgestone Corp., the  world’s largest tire maker , jumped
3.4 percent to 1,536 yen. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia
televisions, gained 1.4 percent to 2,882 yen. Nintendo Co., the
world’s biggest maker of portable video-game machines, advanced
1.8 percent to 21,900 yen.  Nippon Express Co., a freight company, jumped 3 percent to
340 yen after Deutsche Bank AG analyst  Seigo Ando  iterated his
“buy” rating on the company and increased a 12-month share
price estimate to 380 yen from 362 yen, citing improvement in
margins on air-freight forwarding.  “We expect it to generate greater profit growth than peers
as it recoups its upfront costs, and cuts costs further,” Ando
wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Trading companies declined after commodity prices plunged.
Mitsubishi sank 0.6 percent to 2,089 yen. Mitsui & Co., which
counts commodities as its biggest source of profit, slumped 1.3
percent to 1,298 yen and was the  heaviest drag  on the Topix.
Mitsubishi Materials tumbled 4 percent, the most in the Nikkei
225. Dowa Holdings Co., which mines, refines and smelts various
metal-related products, retreated 0.8 percent to 501 yen.  Metals, Oil Fall  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum plunged 6.3
percent yesterday, the biggest drop since May 4. Copper futures
for March delivery tumbled 4.9 percent yesterday. Crude oil for
December delivery dropped 3 percent yesterday in New York to
$82.34 a barrel, the lowest settlement since Oct. 29.  “Investors are looking toward the economic slowdown that
will likely follow tightening in emerging nations,” said Toyota
Asset Management’s Hamasaki. “The market had priced in strong
demand from emerging countries, but the view changed
significantly in a short period of time.”  Companies that rely on revenue in China also declined.
Komatsu dropped 0.5 percent to 2,226 yen. Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co., the world’s biggest maker of giant excavators,
slipped 0.2 percent to 1,870 yen.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on state television
yesterday the cabinet is drafting measures to counter overly
rapid price gains, suggesting intensified government efforts to
combat the fastest inflation in two years.  “Pressure to sell stocks, mainly commodity-related shares,
will increase,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in
Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. “There are worries
demand will decrease on China’s tightening policies.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
