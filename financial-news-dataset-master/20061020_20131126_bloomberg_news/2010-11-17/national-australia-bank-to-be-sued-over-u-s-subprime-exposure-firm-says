National Australia Bank Ltd.  will be
sued by shareholders who lost money because of the bank’s
exposure to U.S. subprime debt, Maurice Blackburn, an Australian
class-action law firm, said in an e-mailed statement.  Maurice Blackburn, with 20 offices along the east coast of
Australia, will file the lawsuit tomorrow, the firm said. Amanda
Tattam, a Maurice Blackburn spokeswoman, confirmed the
statement.  The firm has scheduled a news conference at its Sydney
office tomorrow.  National Australia Bank’s profit for the six months ended
September 2008 fell 24 percent from a year earlier as it
increased provisions for potential securities losses. Bad debts
climbed to A$2.5 billion ($2.4 billion) in fiscal 2008, from
A$800 million a year earlier, as the company set aside A$1
billion for U.S. subprime-related collateralized debt
obligations.  Bank officials didn’t immediately respond today to requests
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
