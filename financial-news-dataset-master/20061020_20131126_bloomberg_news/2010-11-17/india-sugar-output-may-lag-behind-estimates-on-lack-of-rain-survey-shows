Sugar production in India, the
world’s second-largest, may be 8.7 percent less than predicted
as rain, pests and disease reduce yields in Uttar Pradesh, the
biggest cane-growing state.  Output may total 23.27 million metric tons in 2010-2011,
according to interviews with 810 farmers across six states by
Geneva-based SGS SA for Bloomberg.  The Indian Sugar Mills
Association  and the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar
Factories Federation Ltd. forecast 25.5 million tons. The
government expects 25 million, up from 18.9 million in
2009-2010. Raw sugar futures rallied as much as 9.2 percent
today.  A smaller crop may hinder government plans to end curbs on
sugar shipments, reducing global supply at a time of sustained
demand from importers. Prices climbed to 33.39 cents a pound on
Nov. 11, the highest intraday level in almost three decades, as
drought and floods ruined crops from Russia to Pakistan.  “There is demand for Indian sugar from Pakistan, China and
Russia, and Brazil’s production hasn’t changed,”  Abinash Verma ,
director general of the mills association, said by telephone
Nov. 16. “There’s no surplus in the international market.”
Brazil is the world’s biggest grower.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed as much as 2.43 cents,
or 9.2 percent, to 28.9 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest jump for a most-active contract since Oct. 29,
2008. It was up 7.1 percent at 28.34 cents at 10:14 a.m. local
time. Prices closed at a 29-year high on Nov. 9 and slid 21
percent in the following three sessions.  Sugar Surplus  The global raw-sugar surplus will be 1.3 million tons in
2010-2011, the International Sugar Organization said yesterday.  India will decide whether to end export restrictions after
receiving “dependable estimates” for output, Farm Minister
 Sharad Pawar  said in a statement to lawmakers Nov. 16. The
country may have a 3.5 million-ton surplus, he said last week.  “Our consumption is extremely robust as demand from all
bulk users is constantly growing,”  Vivek Saraogi , managing
director of  Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd. , India’s second-biggest
producer, told analysts. “The surplus is a limited quantity.”  Shipments from the country may be 2 million to 2.5 million
tons, not enough to be a “dampening factor” for global prices,
he said. Output may be capped at 25 million tons and consumption
may be “upwards” of 23 million tons, he said today.  “The world market will be determined by Brazil” and sales
from India will happen gradually, he said. “I am not making a
point of shortage in India. All I am saying is that a perception
of an overhang and a surplus is not there in my mind.”  China Reserves  China said yesterday it will offer 200,000 tons from its
reserves on Nov. 22 to stabilize the market and cool prices.  An SGS survey last November predicted production of 17.68
million tons in 2009-2010, 11 percent more than forecast at that
time by the country’s mills association. The group now estimates
the 2009-2010 harvest at 18.9 million tons.  The cane harvest in India may climb 28 percent to 355.32
million tons in 2010-2011 from 277.75 million tons the previous
year, helped by a 25 percent increase in area and a 2.5 percent
gain in yields, the latest SGS survey showed. The study by five
teams between Oct. 16 and Nov. 1 covered states representing 93
percent of output, including Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, the
biggest growers.  Cane Damaged  About 17 percent of farmers reported damage to cane from
heavy rain this year, including 31 percent of those interviewed
in Uttar Pradesh and 1 percent in Maharashtra, the survey
showed.  The rains increased infestations in Uttar Pradesh, with 16
percent of growers reporting severe attacks, up from 3 percent
last year, the survey showed. In Maharashtra, insect and disease
outbreaks were less than last year, it said.  “Uttar Pradesh will produce less than anticipated,” said
Balrampur’s Saraogi. “Western parts of the state were affected
by concentrated rainfall in September. Yields are not going to
be very good. Maharashtra will definitely produce more.”  Growers in most of the states, excluding Tamil Nadu, the
third-biggest cane producer, expect lower prices this season
compared with a year ago because of bigger harvests, SGS said.
Farmers in Uttar Pradesh anticipate an average 220 rupees ($4.8)
per 100 kilograms of cane, down from 235 rupees last year, and
in Maharashtra they expect 193 rupees versus 224 rupees, it
said.  ‘Fairly Good Prices’  Cane supplies won’t be “a constraint,” said Kiran
Wadhwana, a director with Comdex India Ltd., a futures broker in
New Delhi. “Farmers received good payments last year and mills
are prepared to pay fairly good prices” this season, he said.  A price dispute delayed crushing last year by as much as a
month in Uttar Pradesh. Thousands of growers held demonstrations
in November near the parliament in New Delhi, seeking 280
rupees, more than double the government’s benchmark rate of 130
rupees.  India’s cane farmers are a powerful voting block and Uttar
Pradesh, home to more than 100 sugar  mills , sends the largest
number of lawmakers to parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
