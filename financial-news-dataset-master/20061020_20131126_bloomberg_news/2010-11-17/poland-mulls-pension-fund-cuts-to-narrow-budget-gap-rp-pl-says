Poland’s government is considering
reducing or suspending payments to privately managed pension
funds to narrow the country’s budget deficit, the newspaper
Rzeczpospolita reported today on its rp.pl website, citing Prime
Minister Donald Tusk.  Tusk said at a recent meeting that the government may allow
Poles to switch their contributions from private funds in the
overhauled pension system to the social security office,
according to rp.pl.  The cabinet may also consider cutting payments to private
funds by more than half or suspending them for two years, an
option favored by Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski and Jan
Krysztof Bielecki, the prime minister’s chief economic adviser,
the newspaper said, without saying how it got the information.  The proposed measures would save up to 20 billion zloty the
government pays each year to compensate the social security
office for transfers to privately managed pension funds, rp.pl
said. These expenditures add to the budget deficit and Poland’s
public debt under European Union accounting rules.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
