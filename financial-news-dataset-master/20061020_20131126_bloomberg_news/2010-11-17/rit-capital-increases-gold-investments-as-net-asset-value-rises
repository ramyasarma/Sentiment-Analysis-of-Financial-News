RIT Capital Partners Plc , the
London-based investment trust chaired by financier  Jacob Rothschild , added to its investments in gold and posted an
increase in the net worth of its assets.  Net asset value climbed 2.6 percent to 1,190.4 pence a
share at Nov. 5, from Sept. 30, the company said today in a
statement.  RIT Capital  increased its holdings of gold, gold
shares, real estate equities and oil and energy-related
investments, the company said.  “It is hard to see how public debt can be repaid without
resort to inflation,” said Rothschild, a British peer, in the
statement. “We remain cautious.”  Preserving capital rather than maximizing profit will
remain the company’s focus, RIT Capital said. The global economy
will be “unbalanced” for some time as economic power moves to
the East and the West struggles with debt, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
