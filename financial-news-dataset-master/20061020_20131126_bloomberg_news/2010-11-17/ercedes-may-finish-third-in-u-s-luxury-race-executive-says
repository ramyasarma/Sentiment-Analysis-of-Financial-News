Daimler AG’s  Mercedes-Benz brand may
come in third in U.S. luxury auto sales this year behind
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s  namesake brand and  Toyota Motor
Corp.’s  Lexus, the unit’s top executive said.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if we are No. 3,”  Ernst Lieb ,
chief executive officer of Mercedes in the U.S., said today in
an interview at the Los Angeles Auto Show.  Mercedes and BMW have gained ground on Lexus because of new
products and Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota’s record recalls.
BMW and Lexus may overtake Mercedes in sales in the final weeks
of the year, Lieb said.  Mercedes ended the third quarter about 2,700 deliveries
behind Lexus. Customer discounts in October helped Lexus take
the monthly lead and widen its position for the year.  U.S. sales for this year through October totaled 183,529
for Lexus, 178,080 for Mercedes and 176,736 for Munich-based
BMW, the global leader in luxury-vehicle deliveries.  The totals don’t include non-luxury models such as BMW’s
Mini cars or Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler’s Smart cars and
Sprinter vans.  BMW said yesterday it won’t increase customer discounts in
the final weeks of the year.  “We’re chasing profit more than we’re chasing volume,”
said Peter Miles, executive vice president of operations for
BMW’s North American unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
