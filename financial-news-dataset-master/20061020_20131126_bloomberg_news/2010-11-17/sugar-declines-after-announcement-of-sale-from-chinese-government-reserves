Sugar fell for a second day in
London and New York as China said it will make sales from
reserves to stabilize the market and curb price increases.  China will offer 200,000 metric tons of sugar on Nov. 22,
according to a statement posted on the Ministry of Commerce
website. The cabinet is drafting measures to stem the fastest
inflation in two years, Premier Wen Jiabao said yesterday.
Prices also dropped today as European Union finance ministers
started work on possible aid for Ireland’s debt-laden banks.  “Sugar fundamentals remain unchanged, with supply
uncertainties in the coming months,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at
Swiss Sugar Brokers in Rolle, Switzerland, wrote in a note dated
yesterday. “On the futures market, renewed concerns over rising
inflation in China and financial turmoil in Europe triggered
widespread falls in stocks and commodities.”  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery lost $14, or
2.1 percent, to $652.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe at 11:35 a.m. London
