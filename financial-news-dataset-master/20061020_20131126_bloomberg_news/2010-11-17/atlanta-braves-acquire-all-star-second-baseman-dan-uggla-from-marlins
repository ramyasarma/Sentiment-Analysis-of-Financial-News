The Atlanta Braves completed a trade
with the Florida Marlins for  Dan Uggla , the only second baseman
in Major League Baseball history to hit 30 home runs in four
straight seasons.  The Braves sent infielder  Omar Infante  and pitcher  Mike Dunn  to the Marlins for the 30-year-old Uggla, who was seeking a
new five-year contract and rejected a four-year, $48 million
offer from Florida.  “Recognizing that he can walk after the 2011 season, we
could either bring him back for the 2011 season and then have
him leave via free agency, or we could trade him (and) try to
get value now,” Marlins President  Larry Beinfest  told  MLB.com .
“We took the latter.”  Uggla hit .287 with 33 home runs and 105 runs batted in for
the Marlins last season. A three-time All-Star, Uggla had 154
homers in five seasons in Florida.  Infante, 28, made his first All-Star team in Atlanta last
season, when he hit a career-high .321 with eight homers and 47
RBI. Dunn, a 25-year-old left-hander, had a 2-0 record with a
1.89 earned run average in 25 relief appearances as a rookie for
the Braves in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
