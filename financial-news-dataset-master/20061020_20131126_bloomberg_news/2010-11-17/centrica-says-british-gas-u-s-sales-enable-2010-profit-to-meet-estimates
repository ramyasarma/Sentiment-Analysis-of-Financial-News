Centrica Plc , the U.K.’s biggest
energy supplier, said it will meet analysts’ estimates for full-
year earnings per share after it gained domestic customers and
raised sales in the U.S.  British Gas, the company’s gas supply unit, added 270,000
residential energy customers since the beginning of the year,
Centrica said in a statement today. Higher temperatures in Texas
and lower commodity prices improved residential sales in the
U.S., the Windsor, England-based utility said.  Centrica is likely to make 26 pence (41 cents) a share this
year, according to the average of nine  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg. Volumes of electricity sold to U.S. businesses were
18 percent higher in the first nine months than in 2009,
Centrica said.  Separately, Centrica said it acquired heat-pump
installation company Cool Planet Technologies Ltd. for 500,000
pounds. Installation of heat pumps in the U.K. is expected to
increase by 20,000 a year by 2012, boosted by government
incentives, the utility said.  The  shares  fell 0.4 percent to 332.2 pence in London. The
stock has risen 18 percent this year, valuing the company at
about 17.1 billion pounds.  While operating profits are “slightly ahead” of
estimates, interest and tax charges will offset any gains,
Centrica said. Interest charges will exceed 200 million pounds
and the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 will be about 37
percent.  British Gas announced a 7 percent increase in natural gas
and electricity prices for U.K. households last week. The
increase, to take effect Dec. 10, will raise the average weekly
bill for about 8 million customers by 1.50 pounds.  Full-year oil and gas production will be 50 percent higher
than in 2009, reflecting the acquisition of Venture Production
Plc and increased production from its Morecambe fields, the
utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
