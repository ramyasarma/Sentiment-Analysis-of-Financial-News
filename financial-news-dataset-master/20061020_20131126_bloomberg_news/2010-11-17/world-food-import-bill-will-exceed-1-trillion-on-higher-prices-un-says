World food imports will exceed $1
trillion this year, close to the record reached in the food-
crisis year of 2008, on surging commodity prices, the United
Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization said.  The global cost of importing foodstuffs will jump 15
percent to $1.026 trillion in 2010, from $893 billion last year
and compared with $1.031 trillion in 2008, the Rome-based FAO
said in a report today. The world faces “harder times ahead”
unless production of major food crops rises next year, it said.  Rising global demand for non-staple foodstuffs including
dairy and meat is inflating the international food bill,
according to the report. The “sharp” rise in grain, sugar and
oilseed prices in recent months is a cause of concern for prices
next year, the agency said.  “It is unlikely that the effects of higher prices will be
contained in their respective sectors, as many of these
commodities constitute major feedstock ingredients for the
livestock or biofuels sector,” the FAO said. “With price
increases largely reflecting scarcity in export supply, global
competition for securing foodstuffs is set to intensify.’”  Food prices rose to a record in June 2008, prompting deadly
riots in countries from Haiti to Egypt, before falling in the
second half of that year. The FAO’s world  food price index  in
October climbed to the highest level since July 2008.  ‘Harder Times’  The world should “prepare for harder times ahead unless
production of major food crops increases significantly in
2011,” the FAO said in a statement. “For major cereals,
production must expand substantially to meet utilization and to
reconstitute world reserves.”  The outlook for the global food-import bill this year was
raised from $921 billion in June.  World cereal production is forecast to decline 2.1 percent
to 2.22 billion metric tons in the 2010-2011 season, a reversal
of a June outlook for a 1.2 percent rise, the FAO said. The
decline is mainly due to a smaller crop in the former Soviet
Union and “disappointing” yields in the European Union, the
U.S. and Canada, it said.  Global grain stocks are expected to slump 7.2 percent to
512.5 million tons at the end of the 2010-2011 season, instead
of rise 0.9 percent as previously forecast.  Farmers are likely to respond to current grain prices by
increasing planting, the UN agency said. Rising prices have also
made commodities including soybeans, sugar and cotton more
attractive to grow, which may limit the production response of
some products to a level “insufficient to alleviate market
tightness,” the FAO said.  Higher Prices  “Against this backdrop, consumers may have little choice
but to pay higher prices for their food,” the FAO said.
“International prices could rise even more if production next
year does not increase significantly,” especially in corn,
soybeans and wheat, it said.  World wheat production is forecast to slump 5.1 percent to
647.7 million tons in 2010-2011, the lowest level in three
years, even as usage climbs 1.2 percent to a record 668 million
tons, the FAO said. The harvest outlook was cut from 676.5
million tons in June.  “The bulk of this downward revision reflects a sharp fall
in production in the Russian Federation and smaller-than-
expected harvests in many other countries,” the FAO said.  The agency forecast stocks of wheat will slide 9.9 percent
to 180.9 million tons at the end of this season.  Wheat Prospects  “Attention is now increasingly on production prospects for
2011,” the FAO said. With winter plantings in major producing
countries of the former Soviet Union “lagging behind last year
and unfavourable weather hampering early crop development in the
U.S., prices are expected to remain high and volatile for the
remainder of the season,” the FAO said.  Output of coarse grains, which includes corn and barley, is
forecast to slide 2.1 percent to 1.102 billion tons from 1.125
billion tons in 2009-2010. Ending stocks are expected to plunge
12 percent to 198.4 million tons, the FAO said.  “Considering that prices of coarse grains at this time of
the year, corresponding with the main harvest period in Northern
Hemisphere, should normally be at their seasonal lows, there is
a strong likelihood that prices may rise even further from these
already high levels,” the FAO said.  World rice production is forecast to rise 2.4 percent to a
record 466.7 million tons of milled rice on “relatively good
crops” in major import countries, according to the FAO. That
will help lift reserves of the grain by 5.6 percent to 133.2
million tons, it said.  The FAO forecasts a decline of 0.3 percent to 453.7 million
tons for total oilseed production in 2010-2011, down from a
record 454.8 million tons in the previous season.  Sugar production is expected to climb 7.7 percent to 168.8
million tons in the 2010-2011 season, as “strong”
international sugar prices in the past 12 months prompted an
increase in the growing area, the FAO said. Output is expected
to exceed consumption for the first time since 2007-2008, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
