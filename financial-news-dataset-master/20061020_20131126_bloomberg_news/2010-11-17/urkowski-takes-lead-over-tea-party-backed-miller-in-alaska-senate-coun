U.S. Senator  Lisa Murkowski  of
Alaska took the lead over Tea Party-backed rival  Joe Miller 
during a count of write-in votes in the still-undecided race for
her seat.  State election officials reported yesterday that Murkowski,
a Republican, had 92,715 undisputed write-in votes from the Nov.
2 election plus another 8,153 that were counted in her favor
over Miller’s challenges, for a total of 100,868 votes. Miller,
a businessman who defeated her for the Republican nomination in
August, had 90,468 votes, including 20 write-in ballots.  Murkowski, 53, is trying to become the second person
elected to the Senate by write-in vote and the first since  Strom Thurmond  won a South Carolina election through that method in
1954.  Gail Fenumiai, director of the state Division of Elections,
said in an e-mail that a "very small number" of special or
overseas ballots remain to be counted.  Miller, 43, is backed by former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin . His representatives challenged a number of the write-in
ballots for Murkowski as being misspelled or otherwise
improperly cast, and he has filed a lawsuit over standards used
by state election officials for deciding whether those votes are
valid.  Murkowski’s father  Frank Murkowski , 77, left the Senate
when he won the governor’s office in 2002 and named his daughter
to replace him. Lisa Murkowski won a full term in 2004.  Murkowski resigned as vice chairwoman of the Senate
Republican Conference after losing her race for renomination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
