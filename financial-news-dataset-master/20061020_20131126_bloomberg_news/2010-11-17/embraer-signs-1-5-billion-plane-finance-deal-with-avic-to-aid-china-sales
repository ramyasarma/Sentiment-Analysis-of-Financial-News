Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA ,
the world’s fourth-biggest planemaker, signed a $1.5 billion
aircraft-finance agreement with  Aviation Industry Corp. of
China ’s leasing arm to help boost sales in the country.  The five-year accord with AVIC Leasing Co. will cover sales
in China and overseas, Embraer said in a release distributed at
the Zhuhai air show in southern China, today.  Embraer has also sought government approval to build E-Jets,
its newest regional jets, at a venture in Harbin, China as
economic growth and urbanization spurs air travel in the world’s
most populous nation. The country will probably need 950 new
regional jets over the next 20 years, according to the Sao Jose
Dos Campos, Brazil-based planemaker.  The Harbin plant may close if Embraer fails to win
permission to make E-Jets there, the company’s China President
 Guan Dongyuan  said today. The factory, a venture with Harbin
Aircraft Industry Group Co., currently makes smaller ERJ
aircraft. It isn’t clear when the government will decide on
Embraer’s application, Guan said.  European operators of E-Jets, which sit 70 to 122
passengers, include regional units of Alitalia SpA, British
Airways Plc and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.  -- Liza Lin . Editors:  Dave McCombs ,  Neil Denslow   To contact the reporter on this story:
