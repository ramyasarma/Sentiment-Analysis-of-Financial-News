Dendreon Corp.  won the backing of an
advisory panel helping the U.S. government decide whether to pay
for its $93,000 prostate cancer treatment.  Outside advisers to the Medicare health plan said today
they were confident that Dendreon’s Provenge “clinically
significantly” improves survival in men with advanced prostate
cancer. Medicare, the U.S. insurance program for the elderly and
disabled, will take the  recommendations  into account in a
coverage proposal due by March 30 and a final decision in June.  Seattle-based Dendreon won Provenge approval in April based
on a study showing a four-month survival benefit. Three-quarters
of patients approved for the drug also qualify for Medicare,
making next year’s reimbursement decision critical for sales.
Provenge may bring in $1.75 billion in 2014 with Medicare
coverage, according to the average estimate of four  analysts 
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “It improves survival without the additional adverse
reactions that are known with some of the other cancer
therapies,” panel member  Karl Matuszewski , a pharmacology
expert and editor for Reed Elsevier NV health publications, said
today at the meeting in Baltimore. “This is really another
option.”  Dendreon shares are up 36 percent  this year  even after
having fallen 28 percent since Provenge’s approval on April 29
because of reimbursement and supply concerns. Trading on the
stock was halted today on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
