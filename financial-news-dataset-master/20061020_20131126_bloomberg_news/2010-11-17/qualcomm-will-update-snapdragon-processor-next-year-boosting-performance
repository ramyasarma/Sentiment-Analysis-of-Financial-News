Qualcomm Inc. , the biggest maker of
mobile-phone chips, will unveil a new version of its Snapdragon
processor next year, seeking a place in more smartphones and
tablet computers.  The chip will feature improved graphics, built-in
connections to Wi-Fi, the global positioning system and
Bluetooth, as well as faster processing speeds, Qualcomm
Executive Vice President  Steve Mollenkopf  said today in a
presentation in New York. It also will work with the latest
mobile-phone networks.  Qualcomm is using Snapdragon to move beyond radio chips,
which connect phones to the network, and push into processors
that run applications and handle other computing tasks. It’s
also trying to get its electronics into other kinds of devices,
such as tablets. The company says it already has the dominant
market share in phones based on  Google Inc. ’s Android operating
system, which also is starting to appear on tablets.  Qualcomm, based in San Diego, rose $1.60, or 3.5 percent,
to $47.98 at 4 p.m. New York time in  Nasdaq Stock Market 
trading. The shares have gained 3.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
