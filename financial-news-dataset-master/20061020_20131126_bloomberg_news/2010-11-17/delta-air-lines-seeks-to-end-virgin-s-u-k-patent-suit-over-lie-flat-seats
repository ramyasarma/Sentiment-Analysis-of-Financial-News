Delta Air Lines Inc. , the world’s
second-biggest carrier, asked a U.K. judge to rule that flat-bed
seats in its premium cabins don’t violate a patent held by
Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.  Delta doesn’t infringe the patent and needs certainty on
the issue before the disputed Solar Eclipse  seating system  can
be added to a planned 30-million pound ($47.8 million) retrofit
of 32 aircraft in 2013,  Mark Vanhegan , the carrier’s lawyer with
the firm 11 South Square, said today at the High Court in
London.  Delta “is reticent to issue the relevant request” to the
seat maker “whilst there’s a threat of potential contempt over
Delta’s head,” Vanhegan said. “That’s not a conducive
atmosphere in which to do business.”  Providing comfortable reclining seats, at competitive
prices, on long-haul routes can play a vital part in the success
of an airline, according to a judgment last year in a related
lawsuit by Virgin. When Crawley, England-based Virgin introduced
its  flat-bed seats  in November 2003 it increased its market
share on long-haul routes by 12 percent, it said.  Justice  Richard Arnold  didn’t make a ruling at the end of
the hearing.  Virgin, the long-haul carrier controlled by billionaire
 Richard Branson , sued Atlanta-based Delta in 2008 over claims
that its seats, designed by  Premium Aircraft Interiors Group
Ltd. , infringed Virgin’s patent. Virgin in October 2009 won a
patent lawsuit accusing Premium, a U.K. maker and designer of
airplane cabins, of infringing the same patent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
