The New York Mets will complete
second interviews with four finalists for their manager job
tomorrow and said they plan to make a decision before the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday next week.  The Mets are interviewing  Bob Melvin  and  Chip Hale  today at
the Major League Baseball meetings in Orlando, Florida, General
Manager  Sandy Alderson  said in an e-mail to fans. The team will
talk with  Wally Backman  and  Terry Collins  tomorrow, Alderson
said.  Alderson said the team expects to hire a new manager before
Thanksgiving, which is Nov. 25.  The Mets fired  Jerry Manuel  as manager last month after
missing the postseason for the fourth year in a row. They
interviewed 10 candidates before reducing the field to four
finalists, all of whom were with the organization last season.  Melvin, 49, is a Mets’ scout and was the 2007 National
League manager of the year with the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Hale, 45, was the Mets’ third-base coach last season, while
Backman, 51, managed the team’s Class-A minor league affiliate
in Brooklyn. Collins, 61, was a minor-league field coordinator
for the Mets last season and previously managed in the majors
with the Houston Astros and Anaheim Angels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
