Life insurers  are becoming more
likely to avoid downgrades after withstanding the financial
crisis better than banks, Standard & Poor’s Managing Director
 Mark Puccia  said today.  “There are improving fundamentals” in life insurance, a
business led in the U.S. by New York-based  MetLife Inc.  and
Prudential Financial Inc., Puccia said at a National Underwriter
conference sponsored by Ernst & Young LLP in New York. “The
industry is absolutely preserving capital.”  MetLife and Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential, which
shunned government assistance, have each struck deals to buy
units from American International Group Inc. after profit
rebounded on gains in stock and bond markets. AIG is one of
three insurers to receive a U.S. bailout, compared with more
than 700 lenders.  “It takes a lot to kill a life insurance company,” Puccia
said. “You can do it, but it takes a lot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
