Gold  demand rose 12 percent in the
third quarter as consumers in India boosted jewelry purchases,
the producer-funded  World Gold Council  said.  Global demand rose to 921.8 metric tons from 823 tons a
year earlier, the London-based industry group said today in a
report. Consumers bought 529.8 tons of gold for jewelry, led by
a 36 percent surge in purchases from India. Investment demand in
exchange-traded funds fell, and central banks were net buyers
for a sixth straight quarter.  Gold traded in New York averaged $1,228.81 an ounce during
the quarter, up 28 percent from a year earlier, as recovering
economies in Asia and a weaker U.S. dollar boosted demand for
the precious metal. Gold reached a record $1,424.30 on Nov. 9.  “Despite gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in
emerging markets have adjusted their price expectations,” said
 Eily Ong , an investment research manager at the Gold Council in
London. “They want to lock in their wealth in an asset that has
the preservation properties of gold. They’re very well aware of
the value of gold as a jewelry piece and an investment
product.”  Gold prices have rallied 22 percent this year in New York,
heading for the 10th straight annual gain.  Jewelry demand rose 8 percent from 489.7 tons, the council
said.  China Demand  Overall demand from India rose 28 percent as consumers
purchased 184.5 tons for jewelry and 45 tons in bars and coins,
accounting for 30 percent of total world purchases, according to
the report. China demand rose 16 percent to 153.7 tons.  China’s economy grew 9.6 percent in the third quarter and
inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in almost two years.
India’s economy probably expanded by 8.7 percent from July
through September, the Centre for Monitoring of Indian Economy
said on Nov. 15. In the same period, the  dollar  fell 8.5 percent
against a basket of six major currencies as the Federal Reserve
signaled it would buy Treasuries to help boost the U.S. economy.  Gold supply rose 18 percent to 1,028 tons from 871 tons,
the council said. Net purchases by central banks totaled 22 tons
during the quarter.  “Central banks, like investors, are looking for a global
asset,” Ong said.  The central banks of Russia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Sri Lanka purchased gold in the third quarter, the council said.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $30.10, or 2.2
percent, to $1,338.40 an ounce yesterday on the Comex in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
