Clover Industries Ltd. , South
Africa’s biggest dairy company, plans to start trading its
shares on  Johannesburg’s stock exchange  in the next quarter and
will sell shares to private investors to fund growth.  The company, based in Roodepoort, South Africa, appointed
Rand Merchant Bank, a unit of  FirstRand Ltd. , as lead adviser
and underwriter for the proposed share sale, with book-running
to start on Nov. 29, Deputy Chief Executive Officer  Manie Roode 
said in a telephone interview today. Trading of its ordinary and
preference shares in the over-the-counter market will be
suspended to facilitate the listing, the company said in a
separate e-mailed statement.  Proceeds from the listing and capital-raising will fund “a
combination of expansion of production facilities and the
distribution network, which is one of the largest in South
Africa with 40,000 delivery points,” Roode said. “We also want
to move production closer to source of milk, which gives us a
saving on primary costs.”  Clover, whose brands include Tropika, Capri-Sun juices and
Elite cheeses, started operations in 1898 and was converted to a
public company from a co-operative in 2003. Operating profit
adjusted for exceptional items for the year through June surged
to 320.8 million rand ($45 million) from 48.6 million rand a
year earlier, it said in the statement.  The company will raise as much as 500 million rand, Reuters
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Johann Vorster.  To contact the reporter on the story:
