Corn rose from a five-week low on
speculation that China’s efforts to slow inflation won’t reduce
demand for tightening supplies from the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter.  The Asian nation may impose temporary price controls on
“important daily necessities” to counter the fastest inflation
in two years, the State Council said today on its website. U.S.
corn  inventories before next year’s harvest may drop to the
lowest since 1996, the Department of Agriculture said last week.  “Even if China tries to control inflation, they will still
need more food and that means bigger imports from the U.S.,”
said  Brian Grete , the senior market analyst for the Professional
Farmers of America newsletter in Cedar Falls, Iowa. “The market
is back to focusing on the tightening supplies.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 1.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $5.4175 a bushel at 10:45 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Earlier, the price fell to $5.22, the lowest level for
a most-active contract since Oct. 8.  On Nov. 9, corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 after the
USDA said adverse weather had reduced the size of the domestic
crop.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
