South African power demand may
increase 2.4 percent this year from a year earlier, said Alison
Chikova, a chief engineer at the Southern African Power Pool.  Demand in Tanzania may increase 14 percent, while in
Botswana and Angola it is estimated to advance 9.9 percent and
8.4 percent respectively, Chikova said in a speech in
Johannesburg today.  Power-pool members are estimated to install more than
20,000 megawatts by 2015, Chikova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
