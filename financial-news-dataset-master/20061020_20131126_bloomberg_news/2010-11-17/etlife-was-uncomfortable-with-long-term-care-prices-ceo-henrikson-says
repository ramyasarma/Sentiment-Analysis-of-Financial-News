MetLife Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Henrikson  said the insurer’s retreat from the long-term
care market will make the company stronger because prices for
the coverage were inadequate.  The coverage “does not allow you to have a necessary
return on capital and still be competitively priced,” Henrikson
said today at a conference in New York, where the firm is based.
“We  felt just uncomfortable  continuing to grow” in the
business.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, will halt the sale
of new coverage after Dec. 30 while continuing to honor
previously written contracts, the company said Nov. 11.
Henrikson is focusing on expansion in  Asia  and Europe after
paying $16.2 billion on Nov. 1 to buy a life business from
American International Group Inc.  Long-term care policies provide coverage to help pay for
home-health aides or residence in a nursing home or assisted-
living facility. Rising costs for care, longer  life spans  and
lower bond yields are pressuring profits from the business.  “Because of the return on capital, we’re stronger” by not
selling long-term care insurance, Henrikson said in an interview
after speaking at the National Underwriter conference, which was
sponsored by Ernst & Young LLP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
