Swedish  house prices  increased for
an 18th consecutive three-month period in October, raising the
likelihood the central bank will stick to plans to continue
tightening monetary policy in part to cool the housing market.  The average house price rose an annual 5 percent in the
three months through October, following a 6 percent gain in the
September quarter, Statistics Sweden said in a statement on its
website today. In the quarter, prices were unchanged, the office
said.  The  Riksbank  last month raised the benchmark repo rate a
quarter point to 1 percent, its third increase since it started
tightening in July. Governor  Stefan Ingves  said in a Nov. 11
speech he “personally” has taken the development of household
debt into account when raising rates, warning of the risk of
financial imbalances if rates don’t continue to rise.  The average house price was 1.978 million kronor ($283,649),
the office said.  Household borrowing  growth has averaged a
monthly 10.8 percent over the past six years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
