Massey Energy Co ., owner of the
Upper Big Branch mine where 29 people died in April, said the
accident was caused by natural gas and not by coalbed methane,
which had earlier been suspected.  The inundation of natural gas and not methane is
“something unusual” and is difficult to anticipate, Massey
Chief Executive Officer  Don Blankenship  said today at a coal
conference in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
