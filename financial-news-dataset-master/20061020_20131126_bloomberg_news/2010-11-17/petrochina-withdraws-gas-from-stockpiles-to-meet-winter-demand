PetroChina Co. , the nation’s largest
oil producer, withdrew gas from its Dagang stockpiles to meet
rising winter demand.  The company has taken 13.7 million cubic meters of gas from
its Dagang storage facility in Tianjin to meet the heating needs
of the city and nearby Beijing, PetroChina parent China National
Petroleum Corp. said in its online  newsletter  today.  Gas pipelines carrying the fuel from the province of
Shaanxi to Beijing, Xinjiang to Shanghai and Qinghai to Gansu
have been operating at full capacity since Oct. 10 as demand
rises, the company said. PetroChina is also increasing imports
of Kazakh gas to maximum contracted volumes, according to the
newsletter.  Dagang and the newly built Huabei stockpiles currently hold
1.963 billion cubic meters of gas, 8 percent more than a year
earlier, it said. The Dagang store holds the nation’s largest
underground gas reserves and can be tapped to meet peak seasonal
demand or when pipeline supplies are disrupted, according to the
newsletter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
