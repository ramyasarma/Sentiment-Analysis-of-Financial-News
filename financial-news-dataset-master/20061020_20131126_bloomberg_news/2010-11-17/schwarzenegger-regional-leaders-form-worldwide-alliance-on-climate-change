California Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  and about 100 regional leaders from around the
world formed an alliance aimed at fighting climate change and
shifting to a global green economy.  The group, called R20, includes Schwarzenegger, a
Republican, Wisconsin Governor  Jim Doyle , a Democrat, and local
officials from countries including Mexico, Canada, South Korea
and Japan, according to an e-mailed release from
Schwarzenegger’s office yesterday.  The coalition was created as negotiators from about 190
countries prepare to meet in Cancun, Mexico, later this month to
debate terms for a new global climate-change treaty. Negotiators
say the United Nations-led talks are unlikely to result in broad
agreement because countries remain deadlocked over issues and
the U.S. has failed to set a cap on greenhouse-gas pollution.  “We can’t afford to wait for national and international
movement,” Schwarzenegger said in a statement. “Action is
needed now.”  The regional leaders will strive to move beyond gridlock by
helping public-private partnerships and accelerating development
of clean-energy initiatives, according to the news release.  The group was announced yesterday at a climate-change
conference hosted by Schwarzenegger in Davis, California, near
Sacramento.  To contact the reporter on this story:
