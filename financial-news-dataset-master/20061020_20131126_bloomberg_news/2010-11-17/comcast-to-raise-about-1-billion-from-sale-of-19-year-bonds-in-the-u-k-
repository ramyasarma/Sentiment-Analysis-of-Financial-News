Comcast Corp.  raised 625 million
pounds ($996 million) in its first bond sale in the currency as
the largest U.S. cable company funds its purchase of 51 percent
of NBC Universal.  Comcast priced the 19-year notes to yield 140 basis points
more than gilts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, which
is equivalent to 5.5 percent. That compares with a spread of 204
basis points investors demand to hold similarly-rated bonds with
an average 20-year maturity, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  “A yield of 5.5 percent is a very good long-term rate for
a BBB+ to lock in,” said  Charles Stephens , a debt capital
markets specialist at Matrix Group in London. “It was
impressive how quickly they built an oversubscribed 625 million-
pound deal for a U.S. company in its debut sterling issue.”  Companies sold 4.3 billion pounds of bonds so far this
month, 30 percent more than the whole of October, Bloomberg data
show. Philadelphia-based Comcast is using the proceeds for
working capital and general corporate purposes, according to
Standard & Poor’s, which may include its payment to General
Electric Co. for the stake in NBC.  France Telecom SA, the country’s largest phone company,
issued 250 million pounds of 40-year bonds yesterday to yield
115 basis points more than gilts. Motability Operations Ltd.,
which manages a charity for disabled people to lease a car,
powered wheelchair or scooter, and Circle Anglia Social Housing
also tapped the market this week for shorter-dated debt.  Comcast is  rated BBB+  by S&P, and an equivalent Baa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service.  To contact the reporters on this story:
