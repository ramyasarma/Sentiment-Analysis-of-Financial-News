Cotton fell for the fifth time in
six sessions on signs that demand is slowing after prices
reached a record this month and China announced plans to curb
inflation. Orange juice also fell.  China, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, may
impose temporary price controls to counter the quickest
inflation in two years, the cabinet said today. Cotton prices in
New York have surged 64 percent this year as demand in China
surged, and  inventories  plunged in the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter.  “The Chinese market was way overdone,” said  Peter Egli ,
the director of risk management in Chicago at Plexus Cotton
Ltd., a U.K.-based merchant. Prices as much as doubled in the
past year, and “at some point, the profitability for a mill
stops,” he said.  Cotton for March delivery fell 5.05 cents, or 3.9 percent,
to settle at $1.2415 a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Earlier, the fiber plunged by the exchange maximum of
6 cents. The commodity has tumbled 18 percent from the all-time
high of $1.5195 on Nov. 10.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
tumbled 3.2 percent yesterday on mounting concern that China
will take steps to cool off the economy. The gauge fell as much
as 0.5 percent today.  ‘Reasonable Level’  “The market just had to come back to a more reasonable
level” around $1.10 for cotton, Egli said.  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said yesterday that the cabinet
is drafting measures to counter rapid price gains. The nation
may impose price limits on food and toughen punishment of those
found speculating on agriculture futures, the China Securities
Journal reported, citing an unidentified person.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its global
output  estimate  on Nov. 9 to 115.25 million bales for the season
ending July 31, from 116.68 million bales a month earlier, and
forecast that stockpiles will decline to 42.2 million bales.
That would be the smallest inventory in 15 years, according to
the agency’s data.  A bale weighs about 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 0.7 cent, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $1.5195 in New York. The price dropped
3.1 percent yesterday. The commodity has gained 18 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
