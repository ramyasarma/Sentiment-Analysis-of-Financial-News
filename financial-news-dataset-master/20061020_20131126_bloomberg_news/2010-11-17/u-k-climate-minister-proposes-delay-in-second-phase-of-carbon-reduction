The U.K. government proposed a delay
in the second phase of its Carbon Reduction Commitment plan, a
move that would exempt 12,000 companies and institutions from
submitting data on their emissions.  “This will create a window for us to engage in a proper
dialogue with participants about what we need to do to improve
it,” Energy and Climate Minister Chris Huhne said today in
published remarks from a speech later today in London. “We can
also reduce the administrative burden on businesses.”  The delay would mean that U.K. businesses and institutions
that aren’t part of the European Union’s cap-and-trade program
wouldn’t need to register for the country’s CO2-reduction plan
until 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
