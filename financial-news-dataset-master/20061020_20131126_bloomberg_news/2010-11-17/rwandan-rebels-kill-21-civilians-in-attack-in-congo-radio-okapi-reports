Rwandan rebels killed 21 people
yesterday in an attack on a passenger vehicle in eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo, United Nations-supported Radio
Okapi said, citing the local police.  Rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Rwanda, or FDLR, attacked the vehicle about 100 kilometers (62
miles) from the town of Walikale in North Kivu province, the
radio station reported. All the passengers were robbed and
killed, it said.  Congo’s army is in the middle of a military operation
against the FDLR in mineral-rich eastern Congo. Some FDLR
leaders are linked to the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
