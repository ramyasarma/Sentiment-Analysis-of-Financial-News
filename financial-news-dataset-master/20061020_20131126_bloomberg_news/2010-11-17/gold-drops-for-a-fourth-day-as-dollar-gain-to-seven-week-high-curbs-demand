Gold fluctuated in New York amid
concern a failure to craft a rescue package for Ireland will
allow the nation’s banking crisis to spread to other members of
the common currency.  The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s
strength against six counterparts, earlier traded near a seven-
week high. It was little changed as European Union finance
ministers started work on possible aid for Ireland’s debt-laden
banks. Gold, which reached a record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov.
9, usually moves inversely to the greenback.  “Should fear in the euro zone escalate, gold would draw
fresh support from risk-averse buyers similar to what happened
earlier this summer when investors scrambled for the safe-haven
asset on fears of sovereign default,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, said in a report.  Gold futures for December delivery added $1.20, or 0.1
percent, to $1,339.60 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices earlier today fell as much as 0.6 percent and
gained as much as 0.3 percent. The metal for immediate delivery
in London was little changed at $1,340.27.  Bullion fell to $1,336.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,349 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Gold futures’ 14-day relative strength index, a gauge of
whether a commodity is overbought or oversold, last week rose
above 68, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. That’s near the
level of 70 viewed by some analysts who study technical charts
as a sign that prices may be poised to drop. Prices declined 2.2
percent yesterday.  ‘Exhaustion Phase’  “Gold had such a strong run up through to $1,400, and in
fairly quick time, and most of that was on the back of the
weakening U.S.  dollar ,” Fat Prophets analyst David Lennox said
today by phone from Sydney. “We were looking for an exhaustion
phase in the price.”  Irish Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  said talks with the
European Commission, the European Central Bank and the
International Monetary Fund on potential aid for the country’s
banks will start tomorrow.  Gold imports this year by India, the largest global buyer,
have already exceeded 2009 levels as consumers boost jewelry
purchases, the World Gold Council said today. Imports totaled
624 metric tons by the third quarter’s end, against 559 tons in
all of 2009, the industry group said. India bought 214 tons in
the quarter, up from 176 tons a year earlier, it said.  Silver Gains  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products added 0.55 ton to
2,088.07 tons yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65 tons on
Oct. 14. Silver holdings climbed 67.1 tons to 14,828.7 tons, the
most since at least February, data from four providers show.  Silver for December delivery in New York gained 1 percent
to $25.49 an ounce. It reached a 30-year high of $29.34 last
week and is up 51 percent this year.  Palladium for December delivery declined 0.3 percent to
$644 an ounce. Platinum for January was little changed at
$1,645.30 an ounce after falling as far as $1,630, the lowest
level since Sept. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
