Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. , the
world’s second-largest producer of the metal, increased first-
quarter output by 7 percent to take advantage of rising prices.  Gross refined platinum production climbed to 441,000 ounces
in the three months through September from 413,000 ounces a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said today in a
statement. Output at Impala’s largest mine jumped 40 percent to
251,000 ounces.  Impala received an average of $1,528 an ounce for its
platinum in the period, 31 percent more than a year earlier,
when the company lost 70,000 ounces after an accident and a pay
strike caused work stoppages. Prices may rise as high as $1,900
in the next six months, London-based market researcher Johnson
Matthey Plc said yesterday.  Impala  fell 0.6 percent to 211.40 rand at the 5 p.m. close
of trade in Johannesburg.  Anglo Platinum Ltd. , the largest
producer of the metal, dropped 1.1 percent to 692.24 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
