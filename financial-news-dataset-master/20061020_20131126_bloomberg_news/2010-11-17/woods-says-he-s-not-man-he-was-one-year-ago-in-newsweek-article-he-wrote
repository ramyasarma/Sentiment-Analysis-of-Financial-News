Tiger Woods  said he is getting more
enjoyment making lunch and watching cartoons with his children
these days than chipping buckets of golf balls, according to
 Newsweek  magazine.  In a seven-paragraph first-person account in the magazine’s
Nov. 17 issue, Woods recounts how much his life has changed
almost a year after a Nov. 27 single-car accident outside of his
Florida home led to his admission of marital infidelity and a
fall from the top of golf.  “I’m not the same person I was a year ago,” Woods writes.
“And that’s a good thing.”  Woods, who was overtaken by England’s  Lee Westwood  this
month as the No. 1 player in the Official World Golf Ranking,
went winless in 2010 and was divorced in August from  Elin Nordegren , his wife of five years.  While Woods, 34, said his “healing process” is far from
complete, he is learning to enjoy life’s ordinary events more
than he had in the past.  “Some nights now, it’s just me and the kids, an experience
that’s both trying and rewarding,” Woods wrote. “Probably like
the experience a lot of families have every evening around the
world.”  Woods and Nordegren, 30, share custody of the couple’s two
children, Sam, 3, and Charlie, 21 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
