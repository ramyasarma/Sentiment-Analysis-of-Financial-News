Soybean and corn futures fell to
five-week lows on speculation that demand will slow after prices
reached 26-month high this month and China announced plans to
slow growth to limit inflation.  China, the biggest consumer of soybeans, may impose
temporary price controls to counter the fastest inflation in two
years, the State Council said today. A consumer confidence index
in the nation fell for the first time in six quarters. Last
year, China was a net importer of corn for the first time since
1996 even as the government sold state-owned inventories.  “The markets are not out of the woods regarding slowing
demand from China,” said  Mike Zuzolo , the president of Global
Commodity Analystics & Consulting in Lafayette, Indiana. “Price
controls are not the long-term answer, but the markets are
anticipating a possible slowdown in demand.”  Soybean futures for January delivery fell 14.75 cents, or
1.2 percent, to close at $12.05 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the oilseed fell 44.5 cents
$11.7525, the lowest level since Oct. 12.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.1
percent, to close at $5.3925 a bushel, the seventh drop in eight
sessions. Earlier, the price fell to $5.22, the lowest level for
a most-active contract since Oct. 8.  Prices also fell today on speculation that China will raise
borrowing costs in a bid to slow economic growth and rein in
inflation. The nation is the world’s biggest food consumer. The
 Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  fell to the lowest level in
four weeks today on concern Chinese demand will slow.  China ‘Fears’  “Driving the sell-off were fears China will raise interest
rates and place tighter controls on consumer prices and
agriculture commodities to control inflation,” said  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana.
“Price controls could reduce the amount Chinese companies are
willing to pay for grains and soybeans.”  On Nov. 9, corn reached a 26-month high of $6.175 after the
USDA said adverse weather had reduced the size of the domestic
crop. Soybeans touched $13.485 on Nov. 12, the highest since
August 2009, as Chinese demand surged.  Corn and soybeans rose earlier today after the United
Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization warned that rising
demand will exceed production, said  Brian Grete , the senior
market analyst for Professional Farmers of America newsletter in
Cedar Falls, Iowa.  The global cost of importing foodstuffs will jump 15
percent to $1.026 trillion in 2010, compared with $893 billion
last year and $1.031 trillion in 2008, the Rome-based FAO said
in a report today. The world faces “harder times ahead” unless
production of major food crops rises next year, the agency said.  “For major cereals, production must expand substantially
to meet utilization and to reconstitute world reserves,” the
FAO said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, followed by soybeans at $31.8 billion, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
