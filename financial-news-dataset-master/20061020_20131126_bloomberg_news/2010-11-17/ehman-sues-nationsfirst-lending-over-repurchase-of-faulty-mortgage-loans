Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , the
investment bank in bankruptcy since 2008, sued Nationsfirst
Lending Inc. alleging it failed to honor contracts to repurchase
faulty mortgage loans.  Some of the loans misrepresented borrowers’ identities and
occupancy intentions, and involved kickbacks to an unlicensed
loan officer in a purported “sale by owner” contract, Lehman
said in a complaint filed Nov. 12 in federal court in Santa Ana,
California.  Nationsfirst “has refused, and continues to refuse, to
repurchase the mortgage loans” and “to indemnify Lehman” for
unspecified losses, Lehman lawyers said in the complaint.  Lehman, based in New York, claims in court papers that
Irvine, California-based Nationsfirst breached warranties in the
mortgage transactions, and “is required to compensate Lehman
immediately for all actual and consequential damages.”  Nationsfirst officials didn’t immediately answer telephone
calls at the Irvine office. Nationsfirst is listed as a
suspended corporation on the  website  of the California secretary
of state.  The case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. Nationsfirst
Lending Inc., 10CV1753, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporters on this story:
