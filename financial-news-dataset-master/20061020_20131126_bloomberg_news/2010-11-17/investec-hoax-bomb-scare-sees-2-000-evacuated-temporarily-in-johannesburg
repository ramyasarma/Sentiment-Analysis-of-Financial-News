Investec Plc , the South African
private bank and wealth manager, said it temporarily evacuated
2,000 people from its Johannesburg head office because of a bomb
scare that turned out to be a hoax.  After the police arrived at the offices in the northern
municipal area of Sandton, it was established that the
unidentified female caller who said there was a bomb in the
basement was lying, Rob Pinker, a spokesman for Investec, said
in an interview. Staff returned safely to the offices and there
is no indication yet what the caller’s motives were, he said.  In November last year,  Standard Bank Group Ltd. , Africa’s
biggest bank, evacuated 12,000 from its headquarters in central
Johannesburg after a staff member made “unspecified” threats
against the company.  Investec has operations in South Africa, the U.K. and
Australia. It is the fifth-largest bank by market value in South
Africa and is also listed in London.  Investec dropped 86 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 58.49 rand as
of 10:24 a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
