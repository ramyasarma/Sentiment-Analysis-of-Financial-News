Wheat futures rebounded from a six-
week low on renewed speculation that global grain supplies will
trail demand.  The world wheat harvest may shrink 5.1 percent to 647.7
million metric tons this crop year, the lowest in three years,
after drought slashed output in  Russia , the United Nations’ Food
and Agricultural Organization said today. Global usage is
expected to climb to a record 668 million tons. Yesterday,
prices plunged the most in three months.  “Once the market senses that we’ve fleshed out the
downside, it’ll snap back,” said  Louise Gartner , the owner of
Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek, Ohio. “Wheat has a lot of
reasons to hold support,” including  dry  U.S. weather, limited
supplies in Russia and rains in eastern Australia that left
fields in “a mess,” eroding grain quality, she said.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 6.75 cents, or 1
percent, to settle at $6.715 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.5625, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 6. The grain
tumbled 6.7 percent yesterday on concern that steps by China to
damp inflation will erode commodity demand.  Wheat has climbed 40 percent since the end of June as
global supplies declined amid adverse weather. World stockpiles
will total 172.51 million metric tons at the end of the
marketing year on May 31, or 12 percent less than a year
earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Nov. 9.  The USDA estimates that world wheat production will total
642.89 million tons in the marketing year that began June 1.
Output may rebound to 661.52 million metric tons next year, as
production recovers in Russia and the former Soviet Union,
Chicago-based agricultural researcher AgResource Co. said.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
