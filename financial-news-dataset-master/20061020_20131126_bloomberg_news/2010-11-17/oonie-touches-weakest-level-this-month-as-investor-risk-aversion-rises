Canada’s dollar dropped to the
weakest level this month versus its U.S. counterpart as crude
oil, the nation’s largest export, declined to a four-week low.  Canada’s dollar fell for a second day and was the third-
worst performer against the greenback among the 16-most traded
currencies. U.S. reports showing inflation at the lowest level
on record and a more-than-forecast decline in housing starts
added to concern economic growth isn’t accelerating for Canada’s
biggest trading partner.  “The reason why it’s weakening so much is because oil is
at $80 a barrel, the lowest level in four weeks,”  Kathy Lien ,
director of foreign-exchange research at online currency trader
GFT Forex, said by phone from New York. “The weakness that we
saw in the U.S. data today basically confirms that the Bank of
Canada is going to remain on hold for the rest of the year and
probably into the first quarter of 2011.”  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the aquatic
bird on the dollar coin, depreciated 0.2 percent to C$1.0246 at
5 p.m. in Toronto, from C$1.0223 yesterday. It touched C$1.0262,
the weakest level since Oct. 28. One Canadian dollar buys 97.60
U.S. cents.  The loonie has lost 1.9 percent versus the greenback since
Nov. 3, the day the Federal Reserve unveiled plans to buy $600
billion of Treasuries to keep U.S. borrowing costs low to
stimulate growth and inflation in the second round of a policy
known as quantitative easing.  The euro gained for a second day versus the loonie amid
European talks to support debt-laden Ireland.  Bank of Canada  Bank of Canada policy makers last month left their
benchmark overnight rate unchanged at 1 percent, after three
successive increases starting in June. The bank will be on hold
until the end of the first quarter, according to the weighted
average of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Canadian government debt fell, pushing the yield on 10-year
benchmark bonds three basis points higher to 3.10 percent. The
price of the 3.5 percent security due in June 2020 slipped 23
cents to C$103.25.  Canada sold C$1.4 billion ($1.37 billion) of 30-year bonds,
drawing an average yield of 3.638 percent. The government
received bids of C$4 billion for the 4 percent securities
maturing in June 2041, according to a statement on the Bank of
Canada’s website.  ‘Not as Bullish’  Canada’s wholesale sales declined 0.3 percent in September,
after a 1.2 percent increase in August, says the median forecast
of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Statistics Canada will
release the data tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in Ottawa, along with
figures on international securities transactions and leading
indicators.  “The market is just not as bullish as it was a few weeks
ago,”  Blake Jespersen , director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. “On the data front in
Canada it’s fairly quiet, so the loonie is really going to take
its cues from more macro European and U.S. issues.”  Crude December delivery fell $1.90 to $80.44 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since
Oct. 19. Futures have dropped 9.2 percent from the two-year
intraday high of $88.63 a barrel on Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
