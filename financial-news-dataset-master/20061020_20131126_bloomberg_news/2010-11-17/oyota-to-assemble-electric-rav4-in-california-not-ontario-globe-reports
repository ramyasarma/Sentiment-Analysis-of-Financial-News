Toyota Motor Co. ’s new electric
version of its RAV4 will be assembled in California with
unfinished car bodies shipped from a plant in Ontario, the Globe
and Mail reported.  The decision, expected to be announced today, was driven by
political decisions between Toyota and California, dealing a
setback to Ontario’s efforts to gain a bigger portion of the
electric vehicle industry, the Toronto-based  newspaper  said
today, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
