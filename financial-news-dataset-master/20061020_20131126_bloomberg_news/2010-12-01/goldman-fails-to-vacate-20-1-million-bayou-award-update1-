Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  failed to
vacate a $20.1 million award an arbitration panel had granted
Bayou Group LLC creditors who sued Goldman for failing to detect
Bayou funds for which it did transfers were a fraud.  U.S. District Judge  Jed Rakoff  in Manhattan said in a
ruling today that Goldman failed to show that the arbitration
panel had “manifestly disregarded the law” in granting the
award.  The creditors group sued  Goldman  in 2008 after Bayou Group
executives pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi scheme and the
company’s hedge funds went into bankruptcy. The creditors
alleged Goldman failed to diligently investigate the funds and
was liable for fraudulent transfers. The arbitration panel
awarded the creditors the full $20.1 million they sought.  Ed Canaday , a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment on
Rakoff’s ruling.  The case is Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing LP v. the
Official Unsecured Creditors Committee of Bayou Group, 10-05622,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
