Polish Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  said he has “serious doubts” about the country’s
plan to introduce non-tradable pension bonds and raise
employers’ welfare contributions.  The proposal to boost the amount employers give to social-
welfare funds would lead to higher unemployment and increase
taxes, Rostowski said today in an interview with private  Radio
RMF .  The comments contradict yesterday’s statement by Prime
Minister  Donald Tusk  that the government is “very close” to a
compromise on pension transfers and show a yearlong dispute
within the Cabinet on how to keep public debt from exceeding 55
percent of gross domestic product isn’t settled.  Poland is struggling to win European Union approval for
excluding pension-overhaul costs from public debt. While the EU
last month rejected Poland’s request, shared by eight other
members of the bloc, the country is insisting on the
redefinition of debt, Tusk said.  Under the Polish constitution, an increase in public debt
above 55 percent triggers mandatory spending cuts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
