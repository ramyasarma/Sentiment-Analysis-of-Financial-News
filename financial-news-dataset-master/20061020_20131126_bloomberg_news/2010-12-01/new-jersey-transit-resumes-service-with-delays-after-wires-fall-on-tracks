New Jersey Transit  resumed service
with delays after removing wires that had fallen on the tracks
and blocked trains.  The overhead wires came down near  Amtrak’s  Portal Bridge,
west of the Secaucus Junction on the Northeast Corridor line,
said Courtney Carroll, a NJ Transit spokeswoman. Service was
suspended between Newark and New York in both directions for
about three hours, she said.  The wires were blocking both of Amtrak’s tracks that carry
NJ Transit trains over the Portal Bridge. One of the tracks
resumed service at 2:30 p.m., while the second track returned at
4:30 p.m., Carroll said in an e-mail.  Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast line trains will
face 15 minute to 20 minute delays, NJ Transit said on its
 website  today. Midtown Direct trains will operate to and from
Hoboken Terminal instead of New York for the remainder of the
day with delays of 15 minutes to 20 minutes. The Midtown Direct
trains include those on the Main, Bergen County, Morris & Essex,
Montclair-Boonton, Pascack Valley and Port Jervis lines.  Repairs are under way and Amtrak employees are still
investigating the cause of the wire damage, NJ Transit said
earlier today in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
