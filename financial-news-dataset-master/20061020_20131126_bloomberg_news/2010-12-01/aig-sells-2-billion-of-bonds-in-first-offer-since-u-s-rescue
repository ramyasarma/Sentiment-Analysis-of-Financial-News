Bonds issued by  American
International Group Inc.  rose in secondary trading, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The insurer sold debt yesterday for the first time since
its 2008 rescue by the U.S. government. The New York-based
company’s $500 million of 3.65 percent notes due January 2014
rose 0.83 cent to 100.8 cents on the dollar, as of 8:39 a.m. in
New York, Trace data show. The bonds yield 179 basis points
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries after issuing at a
295 basis-point spread.  AIG’s $1.5 billion of 6.4 percent debt due December
2020 rose 0.33 cent to 100.07 cents on the dollar, a spread of
349 basis points, Trace data show. Those notes were issued with
a relative yield of 362.5 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  “It was a good deal because it was relatively cheap,” said
Michael Donelan, who oversees $3.5 billion of bonds as director
of trading and head portfolio manager at Ryan Labs Inc. in New
York. “They priced it at concession, but not as much as what we
would have hoped.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
