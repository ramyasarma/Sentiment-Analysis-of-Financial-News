GT Solar International Inc. , a
supplier of equipment for solar manufacturers, surged as much as
17 percent in Nasdaq trading after winning its first orders for
sapphire crystallization furnaces.  GT Solar  rose  $1.04, or 16 percent, to $7.73 at 3:23 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares earlier
traded as high as $7.84, for their biggest intraday percentage
gain since August 2009. The stock, which initially sold for
$16.50 in July 2008, had gained 20 percent this year through
yesterday.  The furnaces produce synthetic sapphires, which are used in
light-emitting diodes. The sales, to units of two Chinese solar
manufacturers, total more than $84 million, Merrimack, New
Hampshire-based GT Solar said today in a statement.  The buyers, Jiangsu Jixing New Material Co. and Jiujiang
Sapphire Tech Co., plan to use the furnaces to enter the
sapphire market, GT Solar said. The equipment in the two orders
has total production capacity of 8 million two-inch sapphire
wafers a year.  GT Solar entered the industrial gem market with its July
purchase of sapphire maker Crystal Systems Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
