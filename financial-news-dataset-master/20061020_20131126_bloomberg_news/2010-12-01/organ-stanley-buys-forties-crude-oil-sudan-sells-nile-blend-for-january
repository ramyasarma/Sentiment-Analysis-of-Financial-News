Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
North Sea Forties oil from Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  The bank paid 20 cents above the Dated Brent benchmark for
a cargo due to load on Dec. 14 to Dec. 16, according to traders
involved in North Sea transactions. Morgan Stanley bid for
another cargo loading Dec. 19 to Dec. 23 at a 10-cent discount,
while Total SA and Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s Phibro bid for
shipments at minus 35 cents and minus 20 cents, respectively.  The last time Forties traded at a premium was on Oct. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
a trading window that ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior
to the window,  Forties  crude loading from 10 to 21 days in the
future cost 19 cents less than Dated Brent, from 22 cents from
the previous day.  Brent crude for January settlement traded at $87.59 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the
close of the window, up from $86.79 a barrel at the same time
yesterday. The February contract traded at $87.60 a barrel,
narrowing the contango, or price spread, between the two
nearest-term contracts to 1 cent from 7 cents.  The share of North Sea Buzzard crude in the Forties blend
fell to 30 percent last week, from 32 percent in the week to
Nov. 21, BP Plc said on its website, potentially increasing the
value of the benchmark grade of oil.  Sudan Petroleum Corp., the country’s state oil company,
sold 1.2 million barrels of Nile Blend crude for loading in
January to Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. and China National United Oil
Co., or Chinaoil, said two traders who participate in the
market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
