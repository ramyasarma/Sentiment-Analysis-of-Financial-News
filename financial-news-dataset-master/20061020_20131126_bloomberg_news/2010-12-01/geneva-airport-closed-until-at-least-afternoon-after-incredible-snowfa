Geneva airport , which closed last
night because of heavy snowfall, said it won’t reopen before at
least 6 a.m. tomorrow.  “We’ve had an incredible quantity of snow,” said Bertrand
Staempfli, an airport spokesman said earlier today. Passengers
are advised not to come to the airport, it said on the Website.  As many as 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) may fall at the
airport over the day, said Dean Gill, a MeteoSuisse weather
forecaster.  The airport in the Swiss capital Bern said it will be
closed until 8 p.m., while the Basel-Mulhouse airport said take-
off and landing will probably not be possible until 7:30 p.m.  Zurich airport, Switzerland’s busiest, is open, though
reporting delays and some flight cancellations, according to
information on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
