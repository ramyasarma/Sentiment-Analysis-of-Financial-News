Foreign-exchange losses from carry
trades climbed to the highest level in more than two years as
hedge funds and other large speculators unwound bets that the
euro will strengthen amid Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s  index  for carry trades,
whereby investors tap cash where borrowing costs are low to
invest in higher rates elsewhere, fell 9.7 percent in November,
the biggest drop since October 2008. The euro sank 6.9 percent
in November against the dollar, the steepest monthly drop since
May, as Ireland joined Greece in taking a bailout and North
Korea shelled an island of its southern neighbor.  “The euro-zone’s sovereign risks and Korea tensions likely
spurred players to reduce positions in carry trades,” said
Morio Okayasu, chief analyst in Tokyo at FOREX.com Japan Co., a
unit of online currency trading firm Gain Capital in Bedminster,
New Jersey. “There’s a possibility that the euro could fall to
around the $1.2600 level by year-end.”  The euro rose to $1.3032 as of 7:01 a.m. in London from
$1.2983 in New York yesterday, when it touched $1.2969, the
lowest level since Sept. 15. The single currency bought 108.61
yen from 108.65 yen yesterday, when it reached 108.35 yen, also
the weakest since Sept. 15.  BNP Paribas SA strategists said in a Nov. 29 research
report that carry trades using the dollar as a funding currency
are “now at risk of putting the dollar into demand” as
“geopolitical and economic fears” in Asia start to spill over
into international asset markets.  Europe’s Debt Crisis  The European Union’s 85 billion-euro ($111 billion) rescue
package for Ireland failed to quell market turmoil as investors
shifted focus to the finances of Portugal and Spain.  Credit-default swaps protecting from losses on
Portugal’s debt rose 4.5 basis points to 542.9 yesterday,
according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Spain increased 13
basis points to 364 and those on Italy jumped 22 basis points to
268.  Traders reversed bets on the euro’s gains versus the
greenback, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed this
week. The  difference  in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 8,293 on Nov. 23,
compared with net longs of 8,606 a week earlier.  ‘Brink of War’  U.S. and South Korean armed forces began four days of
military exercises off the Korean Peninsula’s western coast on
Nov. 28, a move the North said was bringing the region to “the
brink of war.” The U.S. military has said the exercises are
“defensive in nature” and were planned before North Korea’s
Nov. 23 shelling of Yeonpyeong island near the disputed western
border killed four people.  Carry trades, which flourish most when interest-rate
spreads are wide and swings in exchange rates muted, have lost
4.4 percent so far in 2010, RBS  index  data show.  Higher volatility undermines the appeal of carry trades by
increasing the probability that swings in exchange rates will
erode gains. The JPMorgan Chase & Co. G7  Volatility Index  rose
by as much as 2.1 percent to 13.14 yesterday, the highest level
since July 5 on a closing basis, hurting carry trade returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
