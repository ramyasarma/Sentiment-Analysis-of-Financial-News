SM Prime Holdings Inc. and  SM
Investments Corp. , controlled by the Philippines’ richest man
 Henry Sy , rebounded in Manila trading after tumbling yesterday
amid MSCI rebalancing.  SM Prime, the largest Philippine shopping mall operator,
jumped 11 percent to 11.10 pesos as of 10:43 a.m. local time,
reversing yesterday’s 12 percent loss. SM Investments Corp.
surged 6.9 percent to 518.50 pesos, after falling 7.7 percent.  Yesterday’s “sell-off was triggered by a portfolio
realignment as the changes in the MSCI Philippines Index took
effect,” said  Alex Pomento , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
“The decline wasn’t warranted because these are some of your
steadiest companies in terms of earnings and cashflows.”  Alliance Global Group Inc.,  part owner of Manila’s biggest
casino, and Aboitiz Power Corp. were added to the MSCI
Philippines Index yesterday, raising the number of companies in
the gauge to 14 from 12.  Profit  at Manila-based SM Prime is forecast to reach a
record 7.74 billion pesos ($177 million) this year, according to
the median of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net
income  at SM Investments will likely reach an all-time high of
18.12 billion pesos based on the median of eight analyst
forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
