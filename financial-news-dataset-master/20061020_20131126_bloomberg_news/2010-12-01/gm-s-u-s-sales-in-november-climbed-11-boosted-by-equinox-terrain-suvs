General Motors Co. ,  Ford Motor Co. 
and  Nissan Motor Co.  all reported improved sales in November as
demand for pickups and sport-utility vehicles helped the
industry match its fastest sales pace of the year.  GM’s deliveries in the month climbed 11 percent to 168,739.
Sales of its Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain SUVs gained
60 percent.  Ford’s  sales rose 20 percent to 147,338, fueled by a
55 percent boost in sales of the Edge SUV. Nissan,  Honda Motor
Co.  and Chrysler Group LLC also reported light-truck gains as
they boosted results.  Toyota Motor Corp.  sales fell 3.3 percent.  Industrywide light-vehicle  sales  ran at a 12.3 million
annual pace in November, matching the October rate that was the
fastest since the U.S. government’s “cash for clunkers”
program in 2009. Annual U.S. sales plunged to 10.4 million last
year, the worst year since 1982, after averaging 16.8 million
from 2000 to 2007.  “It’s not like happy days are here again -- it’s one more
plodding step down the road in the right direction,” said
 Jeremy Anwyl , chief executive officer of Edmunds.com, an auto-
shopping research site in Santa Monica, California.  The U.S. automakers’ sales gains lagged analysts’
forecasts. GM was expected to post a 13 percent sales increase
by researcher TrueCar.com, and Edmunds.com projected a
12 percent gain. Ford deliveries were expected to rise
21 percent, the average estimate of five analysts. Chrysler
reported a 17 percent boost to 74,152, compared with a
26 percent average of five analysts’ estimates.  Nissan Increase  Nissan Motor Co. , Japan’s third-largest automaker, said
U.S. sales of Nissan and Infiniti brand vehicles rose 27 percent
from a year ago to 71,366. The average of four analysts’
estimates was for a 16 percent gain. The Yokohama-based company
benefited from higher sales of crossovers and pickups, posting a
combined 54 percent increase in light-truck deliveries.  “You’re going to see strong truck sales all day,” said
 Michelle Krebs , an analyst with Edmunds.com. “That’s being
driven by stable gas prices and pent-up demand from people who
use trucks and SUVs for work and have been putting off
purchases.”  Average regular unleaded  gasoline prices  in the U.S. have
been between $2.60 and $2.95 a gallon throughout 2010, according
to AAA.  Stocks Gain  GM rose 58 cents to $34.78 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite  trading . The shares have gained 5.4 percent
from their $33 sale price in an initial public offering last
month. Ford gained 52 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $16.46. Ford had
gained 65 percent this year. Stocks rose on speculation of
larger effort to end Europe’s debt crisis.  Chevrolet , which accounted for 70 percent of GM’s sales,
boosted deliveries 18 percent to 117,588, the Detroit-based
company said today in a statement. Buick sales climbed
36 percent to 11,725 vehicles, led by deliveries of the Enclave
SUV, GM said today. GMC sales gained 30 percent to 27,590.
Cadillac deliveries rose 21 percent to 11,801.  Sales of the Cadillac SRX climbed 36 percent, the company
said.  “We continue to see a gradual rise in overall industry
demand,”  Don Johnson , GM’s vice president of U.S. sales, said
today on a conference call. “Consumers are still cautious.
We’re starting to see an inclination for people to come back
into dealerships.”  Light-vehicle sales ran faster than the 12.2 million
seasonally adjusted annual rate, the average of eight analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Conference Board said its
monthly Consumer Confidence  Survey  rose from 49.9 in October to
54.1 in November, the highest level in five months.  More Leasing  Leasing accounted for 11 percent of GM sales, up from a
pace of nearly 8 percent for the year, Johnson said. More
leasing and subprime lending from General Motors Financial Co.
Inc., formerly AmeriCredit Corp., should help sales as the
lender and GM work more closely together, he said.  Since filing for bankruptcy last year, GM has closed
Hummer, Pontiac and Saturn and sold Saab to focus on Buick,
Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. Sales of those four remaining
brands rose 21 percent.  GM’s sales topped Lexington, Massachusetts-based research
firm IHS Automotive’s estimate of 162,000 for the month.  “They aren’t blowing the doors out, but it’s a slow,
steady recovery,” said  Rebecca Lindland , IHS’s director of
strategic review.  SUV Surge  Ford’s sales increase was driven by gains from its
redesigned Edge sport-utility vehicle, a 26 percent jump in F-
series pickup deliveries and strong demand for small cars such
as the Focus and Fiesta. Ford’s Lincoln luxury line rose
19 percent on sales of the MKZ sedan, MKX SUV and the Town Car,
which the automaker is discontinuing next year.  Since last November, Ford sold the Volvo brand to  Zhejiang
Geely Holding Group Co.  Excluding that luxury make, Ford’s sales
rose 24 percent.  Chrysler’s gains were driven by the redesigned Jeep Grand
Cherokee, sales of which more than tripled from last November to
10,984. Ram pickup sales rose 86 percent to 18,206 last month.  The Auburn Hills, Michigan-based automaker’s car sales fell
9.1 percent to 13,112.  Toyota Slips  Among the seven top sellers of vehicles in the U.S., only
Toyota reported a decline in the month. Its U.S. vehicle sales
fell 3.3 percent on an unadjusted basis. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a decline of 3 percent.  “It’s a twofold issue for Toyota: The competition has come
out with great products just as they were coming out of the
recall impact,” said  James Bell , industry analyst for
forecaster Kelley Blue Book in Irvine, California.  Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, “took a blow in
terms of public perception because of the recalls and it’s given
people a chance to stand back and take a look at the Sonata, the
Altima, the Chevy Cruze,” Bell said.  Toyota’s American depositary receipts traded in New York
rose $1.89, or 2.4 percent, to $79.58 at 4:04 p.m. It was the
highest closing price for the ADRs in more than seven months.  Honda , fourth in U.S. sales, had a 21 percent increase in
deliveries of Honda and Acura brand models last month, the
company said in a statement. Sales rose to 89,617 units from
74,003 a year ago, Honda said. Deliveries were forecast to
increase 24 percent, the average of four analysts’ estimates.  Hyundai Motor Co. , South Korea’s largest automaker, boosted
U.S. sales 45 percent in November to 40,723, a record for the
month, the company said in a statement. Growth for the Seoul-
based company was led by increased sales of Sonata and Genesis
sedans and Tucson crossovers, Hyundai said.  Detroit Races  GM’s Equinox small SUV outsold Ford’s Escape, which had a
sales decline of 1.4 percent. Ford’s U.S. sales chief,  Ken Czubay , said he wasn’t sure if Escape was losing buyers to
Equinox.  “There’s a lot of competitors in that segment,” Czubay
said on a conference call. He noted that some Escape shoppers
might have instead purchased the Edge.  One in five online car shoppers researching the Escape also
looked at the Equinox, according to Edmunds.com, while
8.6 percent of those researching the Equinox also looked at the
Escape.  GM’s Chevy Camaro widened its lead against the Ford
Mustang, which has held the annual U.S. sports car sales crown
since 1986. GM sold 4,164 Camaros in November, bringing the
total for the year to 75,685, while Ford sold 4,093 Mustangs,
for an 11-month tally of 68,264.  To contact the reporters on this story:
