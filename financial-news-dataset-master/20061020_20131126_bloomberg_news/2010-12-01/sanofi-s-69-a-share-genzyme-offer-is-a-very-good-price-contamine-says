Sanofi-Aventis SA’s  $69-a-share offer
for Genzyme Corp. is a “very good price,” Sanofi Chief
Financial Officer  Jerome Contamine  said today.  “Our price is a very good price, compelling,” Contamine
said as he left a Financial Times drug-industry conference in
London. He declined to comment on whether Sanofi will extend the
offer, which expires Dec. 10.  Genzyme Chief Executive Officer  Henri Termeer  said in an
interview published Nov. 26 by Le Figaro that a provision known
as a contingent value right, under which the price would depend
on the performance of Genzyme’s Campath drug, could be discussed
with Sanofi or another bidder.  Such a structure can help bridge valuation gaps, Contamine
said, while declining to comment specifically on its possible
use in the Genzyme deal. “It’s interesting in principle,” he
said today. “It’s a tool that exists.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
