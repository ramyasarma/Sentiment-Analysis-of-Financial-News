Nigeria’s cabinet approved the
creation of a sovereign wealth fund at a meeting today in a bid
to secure more of the country’s oil revenue for future
generations.  The bill will now go to parliament for approval,
Information Minister  Dora Akunyili  told reporters in the
capital, Abuja. The government has put aside $1 billion to set
up the fund, Finance Minister  Olusegun Aganga  said on Sept. 3.  “There are tremendous benefits” from establishing the
Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority, including a possible
improvement in the country’s credit rating, Akunyili said.  The fund will ensure that Africa’s most populous country
and top oil producer saves more revenue in periods of high oil
prices and doesn’t spend it when crude declines. Fitch Ratings
lowered its outlook on Nigeria’s BB- credit rating to
“negative” from “stable” on Oct. 22, saying it was concerned
by withdrawals from the excess crude account and a drop in
foreign currency reserves.  Nigeria relies on crude oil exports for about 95 percent of
its foreign currency earnings, according to the Finance
Ministry. The West African nation is the only member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries without a
sovereign wealth fund, according to Akunyili.  While the creation of the fund is a good idea, it won’t
solve the problem of fiscal discipline in the country,  Bismarck Rewane , chief executive officer of Financial Derivatives Co.
Ltd., a Lagos-based fund manager, said by phone today. “It has
to start from the executive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
