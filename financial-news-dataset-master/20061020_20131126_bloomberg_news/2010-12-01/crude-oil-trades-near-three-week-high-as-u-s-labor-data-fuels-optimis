world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures added 3.1 percent yesterday as companies in the U.S.

grew in Europe and China, the largest energy user, and cold
weather hit the northern hemisphere.  “The economic news certainly provided some optimism,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director of Commodity Broking

looking quite good. The market is also concerned about the
weather in Europe.”  The January contract was at $86.53 a barrel, down 22 cents,

based Markit Economics said yesterday.  Paris Cold  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed to 55.2 from
54.7 in October, the country’s logistics federation said
yesterday. That was higher than the 54.8 median estimate of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Paris temperatures will fall to minus 6 degrees Celsius (23
Fahrenheit) today compared with an average of 6 degrees for this
time of year, according to data from Customweather Inc. Cold
weather boosts demand for heating oil.  U.S. crude oil stockpiles  increased by  1.07 million barrels
to 359.7 million in the week ended Nov. 26, an Energy Department
report showed yesterday. Inventories were forecast to decrease
by 1.15 million barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst

New York oil futures, jumped 2.7 percent to 34.5 million barrels,
a third week of increases.  The Cushing gains has increased the discount between

barrel today compared with $1.05 a month ago.  Brent crude for January settlement was at $88.62 a barrel,
