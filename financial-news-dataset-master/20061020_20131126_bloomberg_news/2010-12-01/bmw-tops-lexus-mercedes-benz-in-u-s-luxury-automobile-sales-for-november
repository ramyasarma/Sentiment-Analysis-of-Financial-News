Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s 
namesake brand was the top-selling luxury auto marque in the
U.S. in November, overtaking  Daimler AG’s  Mercedes-Benz in year-
to-date deliveries and closing in on  Toyota Motor Corp.’s  Lexus.  U.S. sales for BMW in November rose 30 percent from a year
earlier to 20,097, the Munich-based automaker said yesterday in
a statement. Mercedes reported an 8.4 percent increase to
18,208, while Lexus’s deliveries fell 1.4 percent to 18,240.  BMW’s performance “definitely puts a lot of pressure on
Lexus,” said  Jessica Caldwell , an analyst with Santa Monica,
California-based Edmunds.com, which studies auto sales. “It’s
all going to come down to December.”  Lexus, owned by Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota, has been
the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. since 2000 and is
holding onto the title for the year. Lexus delivered 201,769
vehicles in the country this year through November, topping the
196,833 for BMW and 196,288 for Mercedes.  The totals don’t include non-luxury models such as BMW’s
Mini cars or Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler’s Smart cars and
Sprinter vans.  BMW and Mercedes, helped by new products and Toyota’s
recalls, offered smaller discounts last month than a year
earlier while Lexus more than doubled incentives, according to
discount-tracking website TrueCar.com.  “Japanese companies have a lot of internal pride, and I’m
sure there is a lot of internal politics and pressures that push
them in this direction,” said  Jesse Toprak , an analyst with
Santa Monica, California-based TrueCar.  Sales Incentives  BMW reduced sales incentives and discounts 43 percent to an
average of $3,162 per vehicle last month, while Mercedes’
decreased them 1 percent to $4,195, TrueCar said. Lexus
increased incentives to an average of $3,124 per vehicle from
$1,476 last year.  Lexus will top BMW and Mercedes in sales for the full year,
said  Brian Smith , vice president of U.S. Lexus sales.  “It will be an 11th year for Lexus, in terms of luxury car
and SUV sales,” Smith said yesterday on a conference call.  The sales race in the luxury market suggests the economy is
improving, said  Paul Ballew , chief economist for Nationwide
Mutual Insurance Co. in Columbus, Ohio.  “Luxury retailers, not just car manufacturers, have come
back pretty briskly,” Ballew, a former sales analyst for General
Motors Corp., said in a telephone interview. “Part of that is
higher-end, higher-educated households have weathered the
downturn and participated in the recovery faster.”  E-Class Gains  Sales of the redesigned Mercedes E-Class sedan, which was
introduced in 2009, have risen 47 percent this year, including a
3.4 percent gain in November, the company said.  Customers have pent-up demand,  Ernst Lieb , head of
Mercedes’s U.S. unit, said in a telephone interview.  “It’s just a suspicion, but maybe there’s a bit of
confidence coming back,” he said.  C-Class sedan deliveries fell 2.3 percent to 3,930 last
month, in part because a strike in South Africa earlier this
year reduced inventories, Lieb said.  Sales of BMW’s redesigned 5-Series, introduced earlier this
year, rose 58 percent to 5,042 in November. BMW’s all-wheel
drive version of the sedan, released in October, improved the
company’s sales by about 2,000 units, said  Jim O’Donnell , head
of BMW’s U.S. unit.  Lexus Lead  Lexus will keep the No. 1 spot this year because of its
increased incentive spending and current lead, O’Donnell said in
an interview.  “Next year, I would like to think we may have a go at
them,” he said. BMW will have the redesigned X3 sport-utility
vehicle and a full line of the revamped 5-Series in 2011, he
said.  U.S. deliveries of Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen AG ’s
Audi brand climbed 38 percent to 9,365 vehicles. Audi sold
91,083 cars and trucks in the U.S. this year through November.  “We will definitely achieve our 100,000-plus” goal,  Mark Del Rosso , chief operating officer of Audi’s U.S. unit, said in
an interview. “It will be a record-breaking year for Audi of
America.”  Porsche SE, the Stuttgart-based automaker merging with
Volkswagen, said sales increased 49 percent to 2,416.  Deliveries of Detroit-based  General Motors Co. ’s Cadillac
luxury line rose 21 percent to 11,801 last month.  Ford Motor Co. , based in Dearborn, Michigan, sold 7,648
Lincoln luxury vehicles in November, a 19 percent increase from
a year earlier. Ford yesterday said it hired  Max Wolff , formerly
director of exterior design for Cadillac, as design director of
Lincoln.  Honda Motor Co. , based in Tokyo, said sales of its Acura
brand rose 22 percent to 10,718 last month. Deliveries of
Yokohama, Japan-based  Nissan Motor Co.’s  Infiniti line gained 45
percent to 8,182 vehicles.  Tata Motors Ltd. , based in Mumbai, said Land Rover
deliveries rose 35 percent to 2,922 vehicles while Jaguar sales
declined 3.1 percent to 1,117.  To contact the reporter on this story:
