ADS Holding, an Abu Dhabi-based
commodities company, and Hutchison Port Holdings have formed a
group that plans to invest in African infrastructure, the
Financial Times reported, citing comments from Mark Manders,
chief executive of the venture.  The group, called Baobab Investments, is bidding for port
and railway concessions in Africa and is close to closing three
deals over the next few weeks, the FT said, citing Manders. The
group also includes South Africa’s Grindrod Ltd. and the World
Bank’s International Finance Corp., the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
