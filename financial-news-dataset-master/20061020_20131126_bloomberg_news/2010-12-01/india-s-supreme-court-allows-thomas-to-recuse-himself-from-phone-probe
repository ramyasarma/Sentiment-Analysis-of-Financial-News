India’s apex court will allow the
country’s Central Vigilance Commissioner P.J. Thomas to recuse
himself from an investigation into the award of phone licenses,
according to a two-judge panel of the Supreme Court headed by
Justice G.S. Singhvi.  Thomas was the top bureaucrat in the telecommunications
ministry before he became the corruption watchdog.  Separately, the court asked the federal investigators to
submit the original recordings of phone conversations between
public relations consultant and various company executives and
journalists, the panel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
