Cetip SA - Balcao Organizado de
Ativos e Derivativos , Brazil’s biggest clearinghouse, agreed to
buy GRV Solutions SA, a provider of credit-risk management
services, for 2 billion reais ($1.17 billion) in cash and stock.  The acquisition “will allow a significant expansion of
Cetip’s product portfolio,” the company said today in a
regulatory filing. “GRV’s activities complement the products
and services currently offered by Cetip and reach almost the
same client base.”  Cetip plans to sell 900 million reais of local bonds
maturing in seven years to finance part of the acquisition of
100 percent of GRV’s shares, the company said. After the deal’s
conclusion, GRV shareholders will own about 9.4 percent of
Cetip, according to the statement.  GRV cancelled in June a plan to sell shares in Brazil.  Itau BBA, a unit if  Itau Unibanco Holding SA , and Bradesco
BBI, a unit of  Banco Bradesco SA , advised Cetip in the
acquisition. Credit Suisse AG was the advisor for GRV.  Cetip rose 1.4 percent to 20.50 reais in Sao Paulo trading
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Helder Marinho  in Sao
