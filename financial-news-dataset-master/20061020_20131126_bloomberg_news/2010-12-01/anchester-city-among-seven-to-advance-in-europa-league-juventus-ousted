Manchester City was among seven teams
advancing to the round of 32 in soccer’s Europa League, while
three-time champion Juventus was eliminated.  Mario Balotelli scored two goals as Manchester City beat
Red Bull Salzburg 3-0 yesterday to reach the knockout stage of
Europe’s second-tier club competition. The victory leaves City
atop Group A with one game remaining.  Lech Poznan guaranteed it would also advance from Group A
with a 1-1 home draw against Juventus. The top two from each
pool qualify for the round of 32, where they are joined by the
eight third-place teams from the elite Champions League.  Bayer Leverkusen won 1-0 at Rosenborg to clinch Group B and
advance, while defending champion Atletico Madrid lost at home
3-2 to Aris Thessaloniki to leave the two tied for second place
heading to the final game.  Sporting Lisbon booked one of the spots from Group C with a
1-0 home win over Lille. Gent jumped from the bottom of the
group to second by beating Levski Sofia 1-0.  AEK Athens moved second in Group G with a 3-1 win at Hajduk
Split. Group winner Zenit St. Petersburg remained perfect
through five games with a 3-1 win over Anderlecht.  Young Boys mounted a three-goal rally to advance with a 4-2
win over Group H leader Stuttgart, which had already qualified.
Odense and Getafe were eliminated after a 1-1 draw.  PSV Eindhoven and Metalist Kharkiv advanced from Group I
with 2-1 wins over Sampdoria and Debrecen, respectively.  The remaining six groups will play their fifth matches
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
