Japanese  stocks  rose, reversing
declines as carmakers and commodity traders advanced after
reports showed improving consumer confidence in the U.S. and
faster-than expected manufacturing growth in China.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, jumped
2.8 percent. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s largest trading company,
climbed 0.9 percent. Fanuc Corp., which is Japan’s No. 1 maker
of industrial robots by revenue and gets more than 40 percent of
its sales in Asia excluding Japan, rallied 1.8 percent.  Asahi
Glass Co.  and Nippon Electric Glass Co. both slumped at least 3
percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut investment ratings.  “Consumption in the U.S. looks solid, and we’ve seen signs
of a better-than-expected recovery in the economy,” said
 Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $104 billion. “A strong
Chinese economy is positive, but at the same time that means an
increasing possibility of further tightening.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.5 percent to 9,988.05
at 3 p.m. in Tokyo after falling as much as 0.2 percent and
drifting between gains and losses about 50 times. The broader
Topix index climbed 0.6 percent to 866.07, with five stocks
advancing for every four that declined.  The Topix has decreased 4.6 percent in 2010, compared with
gains of 5.9 percent by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 3.1
percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the Japanese
benchmark are valued at 15 times estimated  earnings  on average,
compared with 13.9 times for the S&P 500 and 11.6 times for the
Stoxx 600.  U.S. Confidence Rises  Carmakers  contributed the most  to the Topix’s gain,
followed by trading companies. Toyota rose 2.8 percent to 3,310
yen, the highest close since June 16, and was the most-actively
traded stock by value in Japan. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s second-
biggest carmaker by sales, jumped 2.3 percent to 3,080 yen.
Nissan Motor Co., the No. 3, advanced 1.9 percent to 800 yen.  Nintendo Co. , the world’s largest maker of portable video-
game machines, extended yesterday’s 3.4 percent jump, gaining
2.2 percent to 23,230 yen. Nintendo said yesterday it sold more
Wii game consoles in the U.S. this year than last year in the
week including “Black Friday,” the Friday following the
Thanksgiving holiday, so named because that’s when many U.S.
retailers become profitable.  The U.S. Conference Board’s sentiment index increased to
54.1 in November, exceeding the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey, figures from the New York-based research group
showed yesterday. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc. said its business gauge advanced to the highest since April.  ‘Economic Recovery’  “As the global economy recovers and the trend of sharp yen
appreciation stops, we’re seeing the conditions for Japanese
stocks to catch up with other markets,” said  Yoshihisa Okamoto ,
who helps oversee about $34 billion at Tokyo-based Mizuho Asset
Management Co.  The yen traded at an average of 82.48 against the dollar in
November, weakening from 81.87 in October, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
income for Japanese companies when repatriated.  Mitsubishi, which gets about half of sales from commodities,
advanced 0.9 percent to 2,134 yen. Mitsui & Co., which counts
commodities as its largest source of profit, climbed 0.8 percent
to 1,318 yen. Sumitomo Corp. jumped 3.7 percent to 1,132 yen.  In China, the  Purchasing Managers’ Index , a measure of
manufacturing, rose to 55.2 from 54.7 in October. That was more
than the 54.8 median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  China Manufacturing Increases  Commodity prices increased after the report. Crude oil for
January delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $84.50 a barrel in
electronic trading in New York. Copper futures gained 0.5
percent in London.  Fanuc  climbed 1.8 percent to 12,200 yen and was the biggest
support for the Nikkei. Toshiba Machine Co., a machine-tool
maker that gets 34 percent of its annual sales in Asia outside
Japan, climbed 1.8 percent to 390 yen. Mori Seiki Co., a
machine-tool maker that gets 19 percent of its revenue in Asia
ex-Japan, jumped 3.8 percent to 893 yen.  Glassmakers  declined the most  among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Asahi Glass tumbled 3 percent to 905 yen after Goldman
Sachs reduced its rating to “sell” from “neutral.” Nippon
Electric Glass, which was cut to “neutral” from “buy,” sank
3.2 percent to 1,138 yen. Nippon Sheet Glass Co. retreated 2.6
percent to 191 yen. The three companies led declines in the
Nikkei 225.  “We decided to downgrade the two stocks not only because
we think current capacity expansion will lead to oversupply but
also because we note that LCD glass makers are starting to act
more aggressively,” Goldman Sachs analyst  Takashi Watanabe  said
in a report dated yesterday. LCDs are liquid-crystal displays.  To contact the reporter for this story:
