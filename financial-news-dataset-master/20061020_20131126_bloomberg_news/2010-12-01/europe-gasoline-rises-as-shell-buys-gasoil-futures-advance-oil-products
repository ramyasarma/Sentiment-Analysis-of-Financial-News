European  gasoline  barge prices soared
to the highest level in seven months as companies including
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA purchased lots. The fuel’s
crack, or premium to crude, narrowed.  Gasoil futures traded on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange gained as Brent crude increased. The crack shrank. BP
Plc bought three diesel barge shipments at $25 premium.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $784 to as much as $808 a metric
ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts pricing window.
That compares with deals yesterday from $782 to $787. The motor
fuel reached $809 a ton on April 26.  Shell and Koch Industries Inc. bought 4,000 tons each of
the 10,000 tons that changed hands in the morning. Total
purchased 6,000 tons in the afternoon. Gunvor International Ltd.
and BP were the main sellers. The trades are for Eurobob
grade, to which ethanol is added to make the finished fuel.  Gasoil and gasoline prices have “limited upside” in the
coming months because of a significant refining overcapacity,
Societe Generale SA said. “Any local product tightness
resulting in a spike in crack spreads is likely to be temporary
and should be sold,” the Paris-based bank said today in a note.  Gasoline’s crack  narrowed to $5.85 a barrel from $6.20
yesterday, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
broker in London.  Naphtha’s crack fell to $2.25 a barrel from $2.85
yesterday, PVM data shows. Naphtha is used in gasoline and
petrochemicals production.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil barges traded at discounts of $8 to $9 a ton to
December ICE gasoil, according to the survey of the Platts
pricing window which ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. That’s in line
with yesterday’s deals.  Gasoil for December delivery increased 1.3 percent to $739
a ton as of 5:18 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The
January contract rose 1.4 percent to $745 a ton.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profit, shrank to
$11.74 a barrel from $12.67 yesterday, according to ICE data.
Brent for January surged 2.8 percent to $88.35 a barrel on ICE.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at premiums of $23 to
$25 a ton to December ICE gasoil, the Platts survey showed. That
compares with two trades yesterday at a $21 premium. BP bought
at the higher price for Dec. 11 to Dec 15 shipments and sold at
$23.50 for Dec 6 to Dec. 10 delivery.  Rhine Barge Rates  The cost of shipping oil-products by barge on the Rhine
river fell to the lowest in almost two months as demand waned
because of high inventories.  The cost of shipping gasoil from ARA to Duisburg in Germany
fell to an average of 3.40 euros ($4.45) a ton yesterday,
according to PJK International BV, a consultant based in the
Netherlands. That’s the lowest price since Oct. 4.  “In spite of the northwest European cold spell supporting
some heating oil demand, relatively high importer stocks and
end-users only buying what they strictly needed kept interest
limited,” PJK said in a note dated yesterday.  The barge clearance level at Kaub, a potential bottleneck
40 miles west of Frankfurt, rose to 212 centimeters (84 inches)
yesterday from 200 centimeters on Oct. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The clearance level is the depth at which
a laden barge can travel without the risk of running aground.  Refinery News  Nynas AB resumed operations at its Dundee oil refinery in
Scotland following a Nov. 10 fire that was caused by leaking
crude. The refinery can process 10,000 barrels of oil a day and
mainly produces bitumen, according to Bloomberg data.  Separately, Nynas temporarily shut some production last
night at its 22,000 barrel-a-day Nynaeshamn refinery in Sweden,
the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
