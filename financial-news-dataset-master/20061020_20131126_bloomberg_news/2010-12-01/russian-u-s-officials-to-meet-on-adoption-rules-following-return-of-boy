Russian and U.S. officials will meet
next week in Washington to complete talks on more stringent
adoption regulations with a view to signing a treaty in the
“near future,” State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley 
said.  “We expect the process will be concluded” on Dec. 8,
though “the formal agreement will not be signed,” Crowley told
reporters. Officials will be “reviewing the final text so there
can be a signing in the near future.”  The last round of discussions on adding safeguards to the
adoption process was triggered by the case in June of a 7-year-
old boy who was sent back alone to Moscow by his adoptive
American mother. President  Dmitry Medvedev  called it a
“monstrous” act and said adoptions could be banned.  Adoptions from Russia accounted for more than 10 percent of
the U.S. total of 12,753 children adopted from  other countries 
in 2009, according to statistics supplied by the State
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
