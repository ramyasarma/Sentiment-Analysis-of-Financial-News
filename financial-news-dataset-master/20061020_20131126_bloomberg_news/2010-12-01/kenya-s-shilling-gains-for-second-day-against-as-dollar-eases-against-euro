Kenya’s shilling gained for a second
day against the dollar as the U.S. currency weakened against the
euro amid speculation the European Central Bank may signal its
willingness to contain the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 1 percent to 79.97 per dollar, and was trading 0.2
percent higher at 80.65 by 14:09 p.m. in Nairobi from a close of
80.80 yesterday.  “Global risk aversion that had seen the euro weaken has
tapered off,”  Rafael Owino , senior manager in the treasury at
the  Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd.  in Nairobi, said in a phone
interview today. “There is a correlation between the shilling
and the dollar and hence the shilling has strengthened.”  Investors were also reassured by the  Central Bank of
Kenya ’s comments yesterday that its purchase of dollars in the
domestic foreign-exchange market “does not distort” the market,
Owino said. The central bank also said that European countries
facing a debt crisis “are not important to Kenya’s trade
patterns or development assistance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
