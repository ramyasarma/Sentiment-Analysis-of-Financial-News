Crude rose to the highest level in
almost three weeks on greater-than-forecast growth in U.S.
private employment and Chinese manufacturing and on signals the
European Central Bank will act to prevent the spread of the
region’s debt crisis.  Prices surged 3.1 percent as companies in the U.S. boosted
payrolls the most since November 2007, according to figures from
ADP Employer Services. Chinese manufacturing expanded at the
fastest rate in seven months. Futures reached the day’s high
after Goldman, Sachs & Co. said oil will average $110 a barrel
in 2012, up from a forecast $100 a barrel next year.  “As the global economy goes, so goes oil,” said  Andre Julian , chief financial officer and senior market strategist at
OpVest Wealth Management in Irvine, California. “The economic
numbers in China and elsewhere today have been very strong and
point to accelerating growth.”  Crude oil for January delivery increased $2.64 to $86.75 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement price since Nov. 11. The contract is up 11 percent
from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for January settlement rose $2.95, or 3.4
percent, to end the session at $88.87 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the biggest gain since
May 27.  Goldman Projections  Goldman Sachs increased its forecast for U.S. gross
domestic product growth next year to 2.7 percent from 2 percent.
The U.S. economy will expand 3.6 percent in 2012, according to a
report sent to Goldman clients today. The global economy will
expand 4.6 percent next year and 4.8 percent in 2012, the bank
said.  “Goldman has been banging the bull drum all year,” said
 Phil Flynn , a Chicago-based analyst and trader with investment
adviser PFGBest.  U.S. payrolls rose by 93,000 in November, according to
figures from ADP Employer Services. The Institute for Supply
Management reported today that manufacturing in the U.S.
expanded for a 16th straight month in November.  “Today’s ADP report shows that private sector payrolls
grew last month,” said  Sean Brodrick , a natural resource
analyst with Weiss Research in Jupiter, Florida. “That means
more people will be driving and gasoline consumption will
increase.”  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index increased to 55.2 from
54.7 in October, the country’s logistics federation said today.
That was higher than the 54.8 median estimate of 14 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  European Output  Europe’s  manufacturing industries  expanded at the fastest
pace in four months in November, led by Germany, the region’s
largest economy. A gauge of manufacturing in the 16-nation euro
area rose to 55.3 from 54.6 in the previous month, London-based
Markit Economics said today.  “Today’s economic headlines point to stronger fuel demand
in 2011 and higher prices,” said  Rick Mueller , director of oil
markets at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “OPEC is not overwhelming the market and global
stockpiles should fall.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’  crude-
oil output slipped 80,000 barrels, or 0.3 percent, to an average
29.05 million barrels a day in November, according to a
Bloomberg News survey yesterday.  European Central Bank policy makers may delay their exit
from emergency liquidity measures at tomorrow’s meeting of the
Governing Council in Frankfurt. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said investors are underestimating the bank’s
determination to shore up the shared currency.  European Rescue  Oil, equities and the euro extended gains after Reuters
reported that an unidentified official said the U.S. may support
enlarging a European financial rescue program by adding cash
from the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. is not discussing
extra IMF money for Europe, a U.S. official told Bloomberg News.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 2.2 percent to
1,206.06 at 3:26 p.m. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased
2.3 percent to 11,260.96. The euro rose 1.2 percent to $1.3133
from $1.2983 yesterday, when it touched $1.2969, the lowest
level since Sept. 15.  U.S. crude oil  supplies  climbed 1.07 million barrels to
359.7 million in the week ended Nov. 26, an Energy Department
report showed today. Inventories were forecast to decrease by
1.15 million barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The weekly inventory reports have become less relevant as
the economy moves to the fore,” Julian said. “We’re reacting
to economic news.”  Oil volume on the Nymex was 548,066 contracts as of 3:26
p.m. in electronic trading in New York. Volume totaled 548,245
contracts yesterday, 21 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.34 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
