Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  and Otsuka
Pharmaceutical Co.’s Abilify drug won the preliminary backing of
the U.K.’s health-cost agency for use in treating schizophrenia
in people from 15 to 17 years old.  The drug, also known as aripiprazole, is recommended for
patients who can’t take or don’t respond to risperidone, a
generic treatment, the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence said in a statement today. The treatment was
reviewed by an independent appraisal committee.  “Although aripiprazole was not found to be as cost-
effective as risperidone as a first-line treatment, the
committee felt that people who were unable to take risperidone
may benefit from aripiprazole being available as a treatment
option,” Carole Longson, director of the health technology
evaluation center, said in the statement. A final judgment will
be issued after consultation with interested parties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
