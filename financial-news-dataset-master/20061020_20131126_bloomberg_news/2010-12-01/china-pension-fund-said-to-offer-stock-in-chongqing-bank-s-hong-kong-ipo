China’s National Social Security Fund
is offering stock in the Hong Kong initial share sale of a
commercial bank from Chongqing, expanding the size of the
lender’s offering, three people familiar with the matter said.  The state pension fund is offering 185.5 million shares in
 Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank , boosting the amount of stock
available for sale by 9.3 percent, said the people, who declined
to be identified before an announcement.  Some 2.19 billion shares are being offered to investors at
HK$4.50 to HK$6, according to a term sheet sent to investors
today. That compares with 2 billion shares previously. The price
range is unchanged, the terms show.  Morgan Stanley  and  Nomura International  are managing the
sale for Chongqing Rural, the largest lender to agricultural and
small businesses in China’s most populous city.  Chongqing Rural plans to list in Hong Kong on Dec. 16 with
the ticker 3618, the term sheet shows. The initial sale would
raise $1.69 billion if priced at the top end of the range and
before the exercise of an overallotment option, the document
shows.  Chen Han, a spokeswoman for the pension fund said she had
no information about the matter. A call to the bank’s board of
directors in Chongqing was answered by a man who declined to
comment or give his name.  Companies have raised a record $49.2 billion from Hong Kong
IPOs this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that
include overallotment shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
