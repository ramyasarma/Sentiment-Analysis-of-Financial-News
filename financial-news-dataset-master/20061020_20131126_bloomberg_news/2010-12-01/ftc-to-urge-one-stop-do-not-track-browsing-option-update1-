The U.S. Federal Trade Commission
will call for a “one-stop” do-not-track option for online
browsing, said  David Vladeck , the agency’s director of the
Bureau of Consumer Protection.  Such a requirement would need congressional action because
the agency lacks the legal authority to impose the rules,
Vladeck said today at a privacy conference in Washington.  “Consumers face a daunting burden in this marketplace to
safeguard their privacy,” Vladeck said. “We hope to provide
updated advice to consumers about how to upgrade browsers to
avoid having their history snatched when they visit a website.”  Proposals letting online users tell Internet sites not to
collect and analyze information about them based on their online
history are backed by consumer groups. The idea is based on the
“do not call” register the FTC set up in 2003 that lets
consumers block telemarketing calls at home.  The “do not track” plan is a partial solution, said Susan
Grant, director of consumer protection at the Consumer
Federation of America, which represents more than 300 national,
state and local consumer groups.  “It doesn’t resolve all the issues raised by behavioral
advertising, but it would give people more control over the
collection and use of their information until we can hash out
the rest of the complex issues that would be involved in getting
some baseline privacy regulation,” Grant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
