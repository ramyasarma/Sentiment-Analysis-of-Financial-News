Ghana’s central bank will allow the
country’s currency, the cedi, to strengthen in the next year in
order to slow inflation, according to Standard Chartered Plc.  “Ghana will become increasingly reliant on a strong
exchange rate to keep inflation under control,”  Razia Khan , the
London-based head of research for Africa at the lender, wrote in
an e-mailed note to clients sent today. “We believe the
authorities will accommodate moderate strengthening of the
cedi.”  The West African nation’s inflation rate fell from a five-
year high of 20.7 percent in June 2009 to 9.38 percent in
October after the cedi, which weakened 15 percent against the
U.S. currency in the first half of 2009, was little changed in
the past 12 months.  The slowdown in price growth enabled the central bank to
cut the benchmark interest rate by 5 percentage points from
November 2009 to July. The rate was left at 13.5 percent at the
banks’ September meeting.  “Ghana’s interest-rate-easing cycle appears to have
ended,” Khan said.  The Ghana cedi will strengthen to 1.37 against the U.S.
dollar “on a one-year horizon,” Khan wrote. The cedi snapped
four days of declines, appreciating 0.5 percent to 1.445 per
dollar at 10:25 a.m. in Accra, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
