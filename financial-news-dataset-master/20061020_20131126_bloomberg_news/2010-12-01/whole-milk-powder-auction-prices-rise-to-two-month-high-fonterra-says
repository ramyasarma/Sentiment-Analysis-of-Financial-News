Whole milk powder auction prices
rose to a two month high, according to  Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd.,  the world’s largest dairy exporter.  Powder for February delivery gained 1.3 percent from two
weeks earlier, according to a trade-weighted price index
calculated by the company after its latest  GlobalDairyTrade 
auction. The average price rose to $3,518 a ton, and is the
highest for the spot contract since Oct. 5.  Fonterra accounts for about 40 percent of the global trade
in butter, milk powder and cheese, selling $12 billion of
product a year in 140 countries. On Nov. 5, the company
reaffirmed it farmer payout forecast, saying a strengthening
currency had countered a better-than-expected performance by
global dairy prices.  Fonterra sells whole and skim milk powder and dried milk
fat at its fortnightly Internet-based auctions. It offers one-
month  contract s with delivery starting two months after the sale,
and two three-month contracts with delivery starting three and
six months later.  Whole milk powder for delivery from March through May
increased 4.1 percent, Fonterra said. Powder for shipment from
June through August increased 2.6 percent. Across all contracts
prices gained 2.6 percent.  The winning first-contract price for regular New Zealand
whole milk powder, which is the reference point for NZX Ltd.’s
futures contract, rose to $3,475. The December futures contract
settled yesterday at $3,410.  To contact the reporter on this story:
