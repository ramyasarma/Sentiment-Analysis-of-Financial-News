Citigroup Inc. , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, reorganized a commercial real-estate
business it plans to sell, with 30 employees moving to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Several workers have already left for JPMorgan and the rest
will go over the next couple of months, according to an internal
Citigroup memo obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by
 Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank.  The departures are part of an August deal in which
Citigroup sold a $3.5 billion portfolio of commercial and
multifamily loans to JPMorgan, also based in New York, for an
undisclosed sum, Bell said.  The memo was written by  Mark Mason , chief operating officer
of Citi Holdings, the division that has been selling the bank’s
unwanted assets since its $45 billion government bailout in
2008. The division valued its North American commercial real
estate loans at $5.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of
2010, down 50 percent on the previous year.  The head of the commercial real-estate group, Tom Lawyer,
is joining JPMorgan as part of the deal. He will be replaced by
Curtis McKinney, a regional manager with the bank.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  slashed the
Citi Holdings division’s overall assets by 24 percent to $421
billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
