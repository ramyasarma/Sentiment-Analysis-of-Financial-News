South Africa’s Board of Healthcare
Funders will today ask a court to clarify a law that requires
medical insurance operators to pay so-called prescribed minimum
benefits “in full,” the Star said.  The board said “in full” means paying for 270 medical
conditions and 28 chronic illnesses at medical insurance rates
and not at private tariffs charged by some healthcare providers,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported, citing BHF
spokeswoman Heidi Kruger. Since reference prices, there haven’t
been tariff guidelines for the industry, the newspaper cited
Kruger as saying.  The Council for Medical Schemes’ interpretation of the
Medical Schemes Act doesn’t provide a cap on charges and would
result in higher premiums for consumers, Kruger told the Star.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
