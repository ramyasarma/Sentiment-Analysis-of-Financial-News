Brazilian clown Francisco Everardo
Oliveira Silva, who goes by the stage name of Tiririca, can
read and write enough Portuguese to take his seat in congress,
the Sao Paulo electoral  court  said.  Tiririca, whose 1.35 million votes led all candidates in
the Oct. 3 congressional elections, was accused by a prosecutor
of forging a document to prove he could read and write.
Brazilian law bans illiterate people from public office.  “A rudimentary reading and writing knowledge is enough,”
the electoral court said in a statement posted on its website
today. Tiririca has “a minimal understanding of the content of
the text, in spite of his difficulties in writing.”  Tiririca won the lower house seat for the state of Sao
Paulo after appearing as a clown in campaign ads and using the
punch line “It can’t get any worse.”  He will be among elected deputies who will be confirmed on
Dec. 17, the electoral court said, citing the decision by
Aloisio Sergio Rezende Silveira. Lawmakers take office Feb. 1.  The public prosecutor can appeal the decision, a press
officer at the court, who can’t be identified because of
internal policy, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
