Zynga Game Network Inc. , the biggest
maker of games on Facebook Inc., will offer its “FarmVille”
title for  Mixi Inc. ’s social networking service in Japan
starting today, President  Kenji Kasahara  said in Tokyo.  The San Francisco-based company is looking to replicate the
success of “FarmVille,” Facebook’s most popular game with more
than 50 million users, on Mixi’s social network, Japan’s
largest. The game is Zynga’s first introduction of an overseas
title in Japan since it entered the market with the acquisition
of Unoh Inc. in August.  Mixi’s monthly active users, subscribers who log in at
least once a month, have reached 14.5 million, the Tokyo-based
company said in November. That compares with Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook’s more than 500 million users and 21
million for  DeNA Co. , Japan’s biggest developer of social games
for mobile phones.  Games played on social networks are typically free, with
the makers of the titles generating revenue by selling virtual
goods such as tractors in “FarmVille.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
