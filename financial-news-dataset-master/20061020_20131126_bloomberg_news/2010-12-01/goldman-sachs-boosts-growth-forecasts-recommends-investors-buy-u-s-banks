Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the most profitable Wall Street firm, increased their
forecasts for U.S. and global growth in 2011, predicted an
acceleration in 2012 and recommended investors buy banks.  The U.S. economy will grow at a 2.7 percent rate next year,
up from a previous forecast of 2 percent, and 3.6 percent in
2012, economists led by  Jan Hatzius  in New York said in a report
today. The global economy will grow 4.6 percent in 2011 and 4.8
percent in 2012,  Dominic Wilson , senior global economist, said
in a separate report.  They recommended U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds, commodities,
Japanese stocks and China’s currency as the first of the firm’s
“top trades” for 2011. The forecasts are a departure from the
pessimism that characterized Goldman Sachs’ projections since
2006.  “This outlook represents a fundamental shift in the
thinking that has governed our forecast for at least the last
five years,” Hatzius said in the report. “The hand-off from
policy stimulus to private demand -- which seemed elusive just a
couple of months ago -- now appears to be developing.”  U.S. stocks started what is historically their best month
with a rally today after ADP Employer Services data showed
companies added 93,000 jobs last month, the Federal Reserve said
the economy gained strength across most of the nation and
manufacturing in China expanded at the fastest pace in seven
months. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced as much as 2.3
percent, the most since Sept. 1.  Underlying Demand  The Goldman Sachs economists said underlying demand, a
measure of growth that excludes the effects of fiscal stimulus
and inventory restocking, has strengthened and is on track to
expand at a 5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.  On average, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the
U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent next year and 3.1 percent in
2012. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
lowered its forecast for global growth last month to 4.2 percent
for 2011 from 4.5 percent, and predicted 4.6 percent for 2012.  Even as growth accelerates,  U.S. unemployment  will remain
elevated by historical standards, declining to 8.5 percent by
the end of 2012 from 9.6 percent in October, the economists
said. The jobless rate increased to 10.1 percent in October
2009, the highest monthly figure since 1983.  Inflation, Unemployment  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is
likely to be 0.5 percent in each of the next two years, Goldman
Sachs said. The combination of high unemployment and low
inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve from raising
interest rates, the economists said.  Conditions will be “positive for risky assets,” they
wrote. The  S&P 500 , the main benchmark for American equities,
will likely end next year at 1,450, up 20 percent from 1,206.07
at 4 p.m. in New York.  The S&P 500 has gained 8.2 percent this year and recouped
three-fifths of its decline from a record in October 2007.
Concerns about the economic fallout from government debt
reduction by some European countries caused rallies to stall in
April and November and are the principal risk to Goldman’s
outlook, the economists said.  Growth in emerging markets may slow next year as
acceleration in the U.S. prompts China, other Asian economies
and Brazil to tighten monetary policy, the economists said.  For its top trades, Goldman recommended betting on a
decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese
renminbi via two-year non-deliverable forwards for an expected
return of 6 percent.  Bets on the  KBW Bank Index  will return 25 percent, and
selling protection on high-yield corporate bonds via credit-
default swaps will return 8.7 percent, they predicted.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average is likely to return 20
percent next year, while a basket of crude oil, copper, cotton,
soybeans and platinum will gain 28 percent, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
