Hong Kong’s plan for greater
democracy fails to give clear guidelines for “genuine universal
suffrage,” the city’s former top civil servant, Anson Chan,
said, according to the Financial Times.  Chan criticized the composition of a committee that will
choose candidates who can run for election as chief executive in
2012, the newspaper said. Hong Kong’s constitutional reform
package passed this year had “dressed up its proposals as
democracy in the making,” Chan was quoted as saying in an
interview with the FT.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
