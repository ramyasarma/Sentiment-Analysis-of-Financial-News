Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection
Department reported “very high” air pollution at two of the
city’s three roadside stations this morning.  The Air Pollution Index was 107 in Central and 109 in
Causeway Bay, the department said on its website.  Readings above 100 are classified “very high” and trigger
a government warning for people with heart or respiratory
ailments to avoid prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
