Hyundai Motor Co.  and  Kia Motors
Corp. , South Korea’s two largest automakers, led a 17th straight
gain in monthly global sales in November as new models helped
boost sales outside of the country.  Hyundai sold 314,569 vehicles last month, 1.4 percent more
than a year earlier, the Seoul-based carmaker said in a
statement to the Korea Exchange. Sales outside South Korea rose
5.5 percent, while sales at home fell 13 percent partly because
a strike at a plant in Ulsan, southeast of Seoul, reduced
deliveries to dealers. Kia, an affiliate of Hyundai, boosted
sales 33 percent to 222,116 units.  Industrywide sales for the country’s five automakers, which
also include Ssangyong Motor Co.,  GM Daewoo Auto & Technology
Co.  and Renault Samsung Motors Co., increased 14 percent to
633,758 vehicles in November. Domestic sales fell 3.4 percent,
while overseas sales grew 20 percent.  “Sales outside of South Korea remained brisk, helping
offset slow growth rate at home,” said  Park In Woo , a Seoul-
based analyst at LIG Investment & Securities Co. He said demand
in the U.S., China and Russia will help increase sales next
year.  Hyundai  rose 3.8 percent to close at 179,000 won in Seoul
trading today, while Kia gained 3.2 percent to 50,500 won. The
benchmark Kospi  index  rose 1.3 percent.  Production at Hyundai’s plant in Ulsan has been halted
since Nov. 15 when temporary workers began a sit-in protest
demanding they be made permanent employees. The strike had
delayed the production of 20,018 vehicles worth 220 billion won
($191 million) as of early today, the company said in a separate
e-mailed statement. Hyundai may consider shutting down the plant
if the temporary workers continue the strike, Vice President
Kang Ho Don said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
