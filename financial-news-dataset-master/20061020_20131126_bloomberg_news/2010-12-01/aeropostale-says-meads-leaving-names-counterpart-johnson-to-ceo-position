Aeropostale Inc. , the New York-based
teen apparel retailer, said Co-Chief Executive Officer  Mindy Meads  is departing and named her counterpart,  Thomas Johnson , to
the top job.  Johnson and Meads had shared the CEO role since February,
when  Julian Geiger  stepped down. Johnson previously worked at
David’s Bridal Inc. and Brooks Brothers Inc. Meads, who is
leaving to pursue other interests, will also step down as a
director, Aeropostale said today in a statement.  Aeropostale increased sales during the recession by
offering less expensive options for teens, undercutting
competitors like  Abercrombie & Fitch Co . and  American Eagle
Outfitters Inc . Today the retailer forecast fourth-quarter
profit of as much as 96 cents a share, trailing the $1.03
average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Aeropostale sank as much as 7.5 percent to $24.80 in after-
hours trading after closing at $26.80 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares have gained 18 percent this year.  The company also reported that third-quarter earnings fell
to $58.5 million, or 63 cents a share, from $62.6 million, or 61
cents, a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
