English soccer club  Fulham ’s
lawsuit against the Football Association, Premier League and
Chairman Dave Richards was sent to arbitration by a London
judge.  Fulham says in the complaint that Richards interfered with
negotiations over the transfer of striker  Peter Crouch  from
Portsmouth in July of last year. The club claims that Richards
unfairly helped  Tottenham Hotspur , a rival London team, buy the
England player despite Fulham’s interest.  Justice  Geoffrey Vos  in London said the dispute “falls
squarely within the terms of the arbitration agreements,” and
it is “legal commonsense” that the lawsuit should be stopped
to allow arbitration to take place.  Fulham had been seeking a court order removing Richards as
chairman of the league, stopping him from being a league
director, and restraining him from participating in future
player transfer negotiations, the judgment said.  “Fulham intends to take its case to the Court of Appeal so
that this important issue can be resolved in its favor,” the
club said in an e-mailed statement.  Premier League spokesman  Nick Noble  declined to comment.  The case is Fulham Football Club (1987) Limited -and- (1)
Sir David Richards, (2) The Football Association Premier League
Limited, High Court of London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
