Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA ,
Spain’s largest maker of wind turbines, has no plans to sell
itself.  The Zamudio-based company hasn’t received any offers since
UBS AG analysts named it as a potential buyout target in October
and isn’t in discussions with any potential buyers, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Jorge Calvet  said today in an interview.  Iberdrola SA , the Bilbao, Spain-based power developer that
is Gamesa’s biggest shareholder and a major customer, has
increased its stake in the company to 17 percent, according to a
regulatory filing.  Gamesa fell 3 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at 5.11 euros
today in Madrid. The shares have fallen 56 percent this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
