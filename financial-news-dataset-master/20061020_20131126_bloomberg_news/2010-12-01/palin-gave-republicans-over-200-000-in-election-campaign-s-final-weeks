Former Alaska Governor  Sarah Palin , a
potential 2012 presidential candidate, contributed more than
$200,000 to her fellow Republicans during the final three weeks
of the just-concluded midterm election campaign.  Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC, gave $244,000
to Republican candidates and state parties between Oct. 14 and
Nov. 22, new  Federal Election Commission  filings show -- almost
as much as she had given in the almost 22 months since she
started her PAC last year. Of that total, $10,000 went to post-
election ballot fights in North Carolina and Alaska.  Overall, Palin’s PAC donated $516,500 from Jan. 1, 2009, to
Nov. 22, 2010.  Of the 81 candidates she supported in the Nov. 2 elections,
more than 50 won, according to a  website  operated by her
supporters. Several Palin-backed Republican nominees for the
U.S. House, such as  Ann Marie Buerkle  in central New York,  Frank Guinta  in New Hampshire and  Paul Gosar  in Arizona, ousted
Democratic incumbents.  In her home state, Palin supported the Senate campaign of
lawyer  Joe Miller , who defeated incumbent Senator  Lisa Murkowski 
in the Republican primary. Murkowski ran a write-in campaign for
the general election, claiming victory on Nov. 18 after a
lengthy ballot count. Palin, 46, gave Miller $5,000 on Nov. 16
to help with the expenses of a recount after earlier donating
$5,000 to his campaign. In 2006, Palin defeated Murkowski’s
father, then-Governor  Frank Murkowski , in the Republican
gubernatorial primary, winning the office that November.  In the race for an open Senate seat in Delaware, Palin
backed Republican  Christine O’Donnell , who defeated 
Representative  Michael Castle  in the Republican primary, then
lost the general election to Democrat  Chris Coons .  Palin’s campaign donations preceded a post-election media
blitz for the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee,
including an interview with the New York Times in which she said
she was considering a White House run in 2012; a new book,
“America by Heart”; and a reality show, “Sarah Palin’s
Alaska,” which airs on The Learning Channel cable channel,
owned by  Discovery Communications Inc .  Palin has raised $5.4 million for her PAC, $3.6 million of
it in donations of under $200. She spent $4.1 million and had
$1.3 million in the bank as of Nov. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
