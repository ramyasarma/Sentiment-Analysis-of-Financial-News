Somalia’s  government, which controls
only parts of the capital, Mogadishu, plans to impose its
authority over the rest of the country “as soon as possible,”
National Security Minister Abdi Shakur Sheikh Hassan Farah said.  The state also intends to reduce corruption and establish
municipal offices across the Horn of Africa nation, Farah told
reporters today in the city. He didn’t provide details on how
the government plans to achieve its aims.  “Somalia’s most critical issue is insecurity, therefore we
should restore security soon, regardless of the escalating
obstacles,” Farah said.  Rebel fighters from groups including al-Shabaab, the
militia that the U.S. accuses of having links to al-Qaeda, have
been fighting the Somali government for the past three years.
Most of southern and central Somalia has been seized by the
rebels, while President  Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed ’s government
controls only parts of Mogadishu.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator  Mohamed Siad Barre  in 1991.
The country ranks as the world’s most-corrupt country, according
to  Transparency International , the Berlin-based anti-graft
advocacy group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
