Ford Motor Co.’s light November U.S.
vehicle sales rose 20 percent, compared to November 2009.  The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for an increase of 21 percent. The figure accounts for Ford’s
ownership in 2009 of the Volvo car brand, which it has since
sold.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
