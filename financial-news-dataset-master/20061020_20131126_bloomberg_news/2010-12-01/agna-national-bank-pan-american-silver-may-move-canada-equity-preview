     Dec. 1 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  rose to a 26-month
high, led by energy and bank shares, after faster-than-forecast
growth in Chinese manufacturing and U.S. private payrolls and
earnings from National Bank of Canada that topped estimates.  Suncor Energy Inc., the country’s largest oil and gas
producer, gained 2.9 percent as fuel prices advanced. National
Bank, Canada’s sixth-biggest lender by assets, climbed 2.9
percent after it raised its dividend. Magna International Inc.,
the country’s largest auto-parts maker, rallied 3.8 percent
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its  rating  on the shares.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  rose 195.47
points, or 1.5 percent, to 13,148.35, the highest close since
September 2008.  “The really positive news is the economy’s moving along
very rapidly” in China, said  Doug Davis , chief executive
officer of Davis-Rea Ltd., which manages C$400 million ($392
million) in Toronto. “If the Chinese economy keeps roaring
ahead, what Canada has to offer is wanted, and demand is in the
marketplace.”  The S&P/TSX has gained for five-straight months, surging 15
percent from July through November. Raw-material companies led
the advance as commodity prices increased in part on demand from
emerging markets such as China, whose economy may grow 10
percent this year, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  rose to a seven-month
high in November, the country’s logistics federation said today.
China is the world’s largest consumer of base metals and second-
biggest energy user behind the U.S.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. companies boosted payrolls by 93,000, the most since
November 2007, after a revised 82,000 rise in October that was
almost double the initial estimate, according to figures from
ADP Employer Services. The median projection of 40 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 70,000 gain last month.  Crude futures advanced to a two-week high. Suncor gained
2.9 percent to C$35.39. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., the
country’s second-largest energy producer by market value,
increased 4.5 percent to C$41.28. Oilfield services company
Trican Well Services Ltd. jumped 5.4 percent to a 27-month high
of C$20.80.  All major base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange
climbed.  Miners Rally  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, increased 2.9 percent to a record C$52.47. First
Quantum Minerals Ltd., the country’s second-biggest publicly
traded copper producer, climbed 6.7 percent to C$97.27. Lundin
Mining Corp., which mines base metals in Europe, surged 6.5
percent to C$7.04 after  Greg Barnes , an analyst at Toronto-
Dominion Bank, raised his rating on the company to “buy” from
“hold.”  The S&P/TSX Banks Index advanced to a five-week high after
National Bank raised its quarterly  dividend  6.5 percent to 66
cents a share. National Bank is the first Canadian lender to
boost its payout in two years.  “Everyone thinks the other banks, to be competitive, will
have to raise dividends as well,” Davis said.  National Bank rallied 2.9 percent to a record C$69.82.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest bank, gained 2.4
percent to C$56.24. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which is
scheduled to report fourth-quarter  financial results  tomorrow,
advanced 2.5 percent to a post-2007 high of C$81.05.  Magna gained 3.8 percent to a six-year high of C$50.84.
 Himanshu Patel , a JPMorgan analyst, raised his rating on the
Aurora, Ontario-based company to “overweight” from
“neutral.” Magna shares have soared 91 percent this year as
the North American auto industry recovered from the recession
and the company bought out founder  Frank Stronach ’s
controlling stake.  To contact the reporter on this story;
