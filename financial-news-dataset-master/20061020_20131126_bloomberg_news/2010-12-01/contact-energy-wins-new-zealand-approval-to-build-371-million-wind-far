Contact Energy Ltd. , New Zealand’s
biggest publicly traded energy company, said it won approval to
build a NZ$500 million ($371 million) wind farm on the North
Island.  The Environment Court of New Zealand in Wellington
overturned today the April 2009 rejection of the Waitahora wind
development by three commissioners of the Tararua District and
Horizons Regional Council.  “There will inevitably be some adverse and visual amenity
effects,” C.J. Thompson, principal environment judge, said in
the 41-page ruling, adding the impact was acceptable. “This is
after all a relatively remote rural landscape with a relatively
sparse population density.”  The proposed wind farm, southeast of Dannevirke in Southern
Hawke’s Bay, will generate about 156 megawatts, enough
electricity to power as many as 70,000 average homes, Contact
spokeswoman  Janet Carson  said. The proposal was scaled back from
65 turbines to either 58 125-meter turbines or 52 150-meter-high
ones, following the commissioners’ rejection and complaints from
residents, she said. The cost remains unchanged, she said.  The proposed 150-meter turbines would be the biggest in New
Zealand, Carson said in a phone interview.  Contact, based in Wellington, hasn’t yet determined when
construction on the wind farm will begin, Carson said.  “Renewable energy developments will play a major role in
the company’s future growth,”  David Baldwin , Contact’s managing
director, said in a statement.  Contact shares rose 0.8 percent to NZ$5.98 at the 4 p.m.
close of trading on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The shares
have risen 1.4 percent this year.  The case is Between Contact Energy Ltd and the Manawatu-
