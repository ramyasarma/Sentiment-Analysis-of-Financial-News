Merck & Co. ’s enlarged-prostate
treatment Proscar failed to win the support of a U.S. advisory
panel for use in preventing prostate cancer.  Outside  advisers  to the Food and Drug Administration voted
17-0 with one abstention today that Proscar has an unfavorable
balance of risks and benefits in healthy men at least 55 years
old. Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, asked to
add data from its studies in prostate cancer to the prescribing
information for Proscar, approved in 1992.  “Merck continues to believe that incorporating more
comprehensive and relevant clinical data” from the Proscar
study in prostate cancer prevention “is important in ensuring
health-care professionals and patients have access to all the
information available to make informed treatment decisions,”
the company said today in an e-mail after the vote.  The FDA panel, by a 14-2 vote, also declined to back
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc ’s application for formal approval to expand
use of its similar medicine Avodart in men at risk for prostate
cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
