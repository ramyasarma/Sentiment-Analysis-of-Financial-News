FXCM Inc. , which provides currency
trading on the Internet for individual investors, raised $211
million selling its initial public offering at the midpoint of
the forecast price range.  The operator of the  DailyFX.com  website sold 15.1 million
shares at $14 each after offering them at $13 to $15, according
to a  filing  with the Securities and Exchange Commission and data
compiled by Bloomberg. At the midpoint, the IPO valued FXCM at
16 times earnings, an 42 percent discount to the median of five
companies cited in the IPO prospectus as competitors, data
compiled by IPOdesktop.com and Bloomberg show.  The initial offering was the first by an online trading
platform since  Interactive Brokers Group Inc.  in May 2007 and
followed the busiest month for U.S. IPOs in three years, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Foreign-exchange trading by
individual investors has surged 12-fold since 2001, according to
Boston-based Aite Group LLC.  The initial sale from FXCM is the only IPO scheduled for
this week after 23 companies completed offerings last month, the
most since November 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Detroit-based  General Motors Co.  sold $18.1 billion of common
shares in the second-largest U.S. IPO on record.  Sales Growth  FXCM’s  profits climbed 16 percent to $79.4 million in the
first nine months of 2010 after rising 12 percent in the
previous four years, according to its SEC filing.  Revenue  increased 6.5 percent to $264 million in the first
three quarters of this year. Trading from individual investors
accounted for 94 percent of sales in 2009, the prospectus said.  The IPO midpoint valued FXCM at 16 times 2010 earnings,
according to Marina del Rey, California-based IPOdesktop.com.  Interactive Brokers , the Greenwich, Connecticut-based
options market maker, trades at 27.5 times estimated 2010
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  OptionsXpress
Holdings Inc. , the online derivatives brokerage in Chicago that
completed an IPO in 2005, is valued at 20.1 times profit.  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.  the Omaha, Nebraska-based
retail brokerage, trades at 17 times earnings for the year ended
in September. E*Trade Financial Corp. of New York is valued at
437 times estimated 2010 profit and 26 times 2011 earnings,
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gain Capital’s IPO  Gain Capital Holdings Inc. , the Bedminster, New Jersey-
based operator of FOREX.com, registered with the SEC in August
2009 to sell $125 million of stock in an initial offering. The
company said in an amended filing last week that it may raise
$190 million.  FXCM and Gain Capital were seeking to go public after
foreign exchange trading totaled an average of $4 trillion a day
in April 2010, about 20 percent higher than three years earlier,
according to data compiled by the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank
of International Settlements.  Average daily currency trading by individual investors
totaled about $125 billion in 2009, an increase from $10 billion
in 2001, according to  Sang Lee , managing partner at Aite Group,
an advisory firm for the financial-services industry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
