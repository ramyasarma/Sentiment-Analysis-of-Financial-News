The Asian Development Bank expects a
fund it established to identify and develop sun-powered projects
to help increase solar capacity in the region sixfold to 3,000
megawatts by 2013.  The  Asia Solar Energy Initiative , established in May, will
help countries in the region install 1,000 megawatts by the end
of 2011, up from 500 megawatts before the initiative began, the
bank said today in a statement. The ADB may fund about $2.25
billion of the estimated $9 billion cost to reach 3,000
megawatts,  Haruhiko Kuroda , president of the Asian Development
Bank, said at a briefing today in Tokyo.  The announcement occurs as two weeks of United Nations-led
talks aimed at reaching a global agreement to tackle climate
change are underway in Cancun, Mexico. Kuroda said negotiators
there are seeking to strike a balance between economic
development and sustainability, and that solar power can be a
key contributor to mitigating climate change in Asia.  “Asian countries will need to aim to maintain economic
progress and improve energy security, while simultaneously
charting a new low-carbon development path,” he said. “This
initiative could contribute significantly to the issues under
consideration in Cancun.”  The bank set a target of 3,000 megawatts to provide enough
scale to create momentum and drive down costs, Kuroda said.
While wind power is currently cheaper than solar in the region,
the bank expects the cost differential to narrow and eventually
be reversed as more solar is installed, he said.  “Solar power has the greatest potential,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
