Bharti Airtel Ltd., India’s largest
mobile-phone operator, dropped 3.4 percent to 347.9 rupees as of
1:22 p.m. in Mumbai trading, set for its sharpest decline since
Nov. 12.  A reduction in call rates by Bharti’s Nigerian unit may
trigger a price war, BusinessDay newspaper reported, citing
analysts it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
