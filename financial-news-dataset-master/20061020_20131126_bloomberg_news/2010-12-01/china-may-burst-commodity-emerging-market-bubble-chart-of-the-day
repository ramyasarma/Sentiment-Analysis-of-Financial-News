Emerging-market stocks and
commodities are in a bubble that will deflate as China’s
economic expansion slows, according to  Albert Edwards , a
strategist at Societe Generale.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows what may lie ahead by tracking
year-over-year percentage changes in a Chinese leading economic
indicator, compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development. The chart also includes MSCI’s Emerging Markets
 Index  and the Continuous Commodity  Index , a gauge that used to
be the Commodity Research Bureau Index.  For 10 straight months, the OECD’s  index  has risen at a
slower rate. The indicator stood at 9.8 percent in September,
the latest month available, after peaking at 26.9 percent in
November 2009.  “Commodity and emerging-market bulls ignore the weak
Chinese leading indicator at their peril,” Edwards wrote in a
report today.  September’s reading was comparable to the level in June
2008, as the chart shows. Back then, emerging-market stocks were
starting to tumble and commodity prices were peaking. History is
likely to repeat itself, the report said.  “We are witnessing a bubble of epic proportions which will
burst,” Edwards wrote. He added that investors are likely to be
caught unaware by this collapse, as they were when a mid-1990s
surge in Asian  stocks  gave way to a plunge.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
