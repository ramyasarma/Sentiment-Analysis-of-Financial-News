U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after a private report showed U.S. companies added more
jobs than economists forecast last month, bolstering optimism in
the economic recovery.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month rose 1.3 percent to 1,195.1 at 8:18 a.m. in New York. Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures rallied 132 points, or 1.2
percent, to 11,128.  Companies in the U.S. added 93,000 workers to payrolls in
November, according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The
ADP number was forecast to show a gain of 70,000 jobs, according
to the median estimate of 40 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Projections ranged from gains of 40,000 to
125,000.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent yesterday, taking the
measure to a 0.2 percent decline for November, as concern
mounted that Europe’s government debt crisis will worsen and as
 Google Inc . faced an antitrust probe.  Today’s factory index from the Institute for Supply
Management will show U.S. manufacturing expanded for the 16th
consecutive month in November, a sign that the world’s largest
economy continues to recover. Economists forecast a reading of
56.5, little changed from the index’s five-month high of 56.9 in
October, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. Another report may show construction spending fell. Both
reports are due at 10 a.m. New York time.  The Federal Reserve will release its report on regional
economic activity, known as the Beige Book, at 2 p.m.  Chinese Manufacturing  Earlier today, China’s logistics federation reported that
the country’s manufacturing industry grew at a faster rate for a
fourth straight month in November. The federation’s Purchasing
Managers’ Index rose to 55.2 last month, the fastest pace in
seven months, from 54.7 in October. That beat the 54.8 median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Fed, under orders from Congress, will today identify
who received $3.3 trillion in emergency aid that the central
bank provided as it fought the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression.  The Fed intends to post the data on its website at midday
in Washington to comply with a provision in July’s Dodd-Frank
law that overhauled financial regulation. The information spans
six loan programs as well as currency swaps with other central
banks, purchases of mortgage-backed securities and the rescues
of Bear Stearns Cos. and  American International Group Inc .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
