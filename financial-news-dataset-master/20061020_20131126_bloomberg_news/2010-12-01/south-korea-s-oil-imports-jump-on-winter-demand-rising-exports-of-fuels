South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest
crude buyer, increased oil imports for a seventh month to meet
winter demand and as fuel exports gained.  Imports rose to 76.8 million barrels last month from 59.1
million barrels a year earlier, the  Ministry of Knowledge
Economy  said in an e-mailed statement today.  SK Energy Co. , South Korea’s biggest refiner, raised the
operating rate at its crude distillation units to 82 percent
last month from 68 percent a year earlier. The country’s oil-
product exports jumped 29 percent as overseas diesel and jet
fuel demand gained, according to the ministry.  South Korea’s crude import bill climbed 42 percent to $6.3
billion last month from a year earlier as Asian benchmark Dubai
prices advanced 7.6 percent to $83.60 a barrel, the government
said. Gas import costs increased 43.9 percent.  Petrochemical exports rose 24.9 percent by value from a
year earlier as higher crude costs pushed up the price of
naphtha, the raw material used to make plastics, the ministry
said. The export price of the petrochemical rose 15 percent to
$1,374 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
