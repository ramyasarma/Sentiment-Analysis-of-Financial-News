The productivity of U.S. workers
rebounded more in the third quarter than previously estimated,
showing companies were focused on controlling costs.  The measure of employee output per hour rose at a 2.3
percent annual rate, compared with the 1.9 percent initially
calculated and a 1.8 percent drop in the previous three months,
revised figures from the Labor Department showed today in
Washington. Labor expenses fell.  Gains in payrolls and the workweek so far this quarter
indicate companies are coming up against limits on how much more
efficiency they can wring from current staff to meet rising
sales.  General Motors Co.  is among businesses planning to boost
employment in a bid to take advantage of a growing market.  “In the third quarter, companies were still trying to
squeeze whatever they could out of their workforce, but it’s
pretty evident the current labor levels are about as tight as
they come,” said Russell Price, a senior economist at
Ameriprise Financial Inc. in Detroit. “We’re beginning to see
better momentum in the economy.”  Economists projected productivity would increase 2.3
percent, according to the median of 66 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey. Estimates ranged from increases of 1.9 percent to
2.8 percent.  Companies boosted payrolls more than forecast in November,
propelled by increased hiring at small businesses, separate data
from a private report showed today.  Small Firms  Employment increased by 93,000, the most since November
2007, after a revised 82,000 rise in October that was almost
double the initial estimate, according to ADP Employer Services.
The median projection of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a 70,000 gain last month. Small firms added more
workers than at any time since the recession began in December
2007.  Stock-index futures maintained gains and Treasuries fell
after the reports. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring this month rose 1.3 percent to 1,195 at 8:46 a.m. in
New York. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves
inversely to price, rose to 2.91 percent from 2.80 percent late
yesterday.  Labor costs, adjusted for efficiency gains, fell at a 0.1
percent pace, the same as previously estimated, the Labor
Department report showed. Costs were projected to fall 0.2
percent, according to the Bloomberg survey median. Expenses in
the second quarter jumped 4.9, the most in almost two years,
reflecting the Commerce Department’s revised data on gross
domestic product and personal income issued last week.  More Growth  The economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in July
through September, more than the 2 percent initially calculated,
the Commerce Department reported on Nov. 23.  Corporate profits rose 2.8 percent from the previous three
months and have been up every quarter since the first three
months of 2009, the GDP report showed.  Wages and salaries  jumped
by $97.4 billion at an annual pace in the second quarter and
$51.4 billion from July through September.  Hours worked climbed 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the
biggest gain since 2006, today’s report showed.  Among manufacturers, productivity rose at a 0.6 percent
annual pace after rising 5.6 percent in the second three months
of the year.  The economic recovery has spurred enough demand to support
an increase in trucking shipments that may boost truck sales and
production next year as companies replace the oldest fleet in at
least 31 years.  Sales Improving  “We think both 2011 and 2012 will be years of significant
growth in the North American heavy duty truck market,” Eaton
Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Sandy Cutler  said in a Nov. 11
interview. He didn’t say whether the parts maker would increase
its production.  Compared with the third quarter of 2009, productivity rose
2.5 percent. Efficiency has cooled since reaching a 6.3 percent
year-over-year increase in the first quarter, the biggest since
1962, as growing sales prompted companies to hire and boost the
workweek.  The Labor Department may report on Dec. 3 that the U.S.
added 145,000 jobs in November and private firms expanded their
workforce for an 11th straight month, according to economist
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  General Motors will hire 1,000 engineers in Michigan to
help expand the automakers’ lineup of electric-drive vehicles,
the maker of the Chevrolet Volt gasoline-electric car said
yesterday. GM plans to sell 10,000 Volts next year and 45,000 in
2012.  The pace of job and employment growth will have to pick up
further to bring down the unemployment rate, currently hovering
near 10 percent. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month
projected the jobless rate will average 9.3 percent next year,
compared with 9.6 percent in 2010 and 9.3 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
