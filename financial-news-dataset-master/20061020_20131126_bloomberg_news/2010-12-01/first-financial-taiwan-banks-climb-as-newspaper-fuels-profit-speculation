First Financial Holding Co.  led
Taiwan banking stocks higher in Taipei after the Commercial
Times reported that local banks made a record pretax profit in
the first ten months of 2010.  First Financial surged 6.9 percent to NT$21.80 as of 11:23
a.m., set for the highest close since Sept. 12, 2008.  Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank  jumped 6.9 percent to NT$21.65.  Hua Nan
Financial Holdings Co.  climbed 6.9 percent to NT$21, set for the
biggest advance since May 19, 2009.  “Investors expect the banks to make more profit in future
with more loans and also these banks may soon set up branches in
China,”  Eric Zhang , an analyst at Grand Cathay Securities Corp,
said in a telephone interview in Taipei.  A gauge of 36 financial and insurance companies in the
Taiex Index gained 3.9 percent, the biggest advance since Feb.
22, and the best performer among 28 industry groups.  Thirty-seven domestic banks made a total pretax profit of
NT$156.37 billion in the first ten months of the year, the
Commercial Times said. The record earnings can be attributed to
lower non-performing loans and improved asset quality, the
Chinese-language daily reported, citing  Lin Tung-liang , chief
secretary at the  Financial Supervisory Commission .  Lee Jih-chu , vice chairwoman and spokeswoman at the FSC,
wasn’t immediately available for comment at her office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
