U.S. equities  will rise next year as
companies continue to boost profits and the Federal Reserve
keeps its $600 billion commitment to expanding the economy, RBC
Capital Markets said.  The firm raised its rating for  industrials  stocks and
recommends energy, health care and technology companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, saying it “modestly increased”
the portfolio’s economic sensitivity, according to a report
today. Combined earnings for the index rise to $88 a share next
year, RBC said. For  Canadian  companies, RBC has an overweight
rating on energy, consumer discretionary and telecommunications
shares.  “Stabilization in leading global macro data points to an
ongoing economic and earnings recovery,”  Myles Zyblock , RBC’s
Toronto-based chief institutional strategist, wrote in today’s
report. “Fundamental growth combined with supportive monetary
policy settings will probably carry equities higher.”  U.S. equities have gained as the Federal Reserve said it
would buy up to $600 billion of securities through June, marking
the second round of quantitative easing since the financial
crisis began in 2008. Better-than-estimated  earnings  also helped
the S&P 500 climb 5.9 percent in 2010.  The benchmark gauge for American equities increased 1.6
percent to 1,199.96 as of 9:50 a.m. in New York.  The economic benefits from government spending will fade
next year and must be offset by an increase in business spending
and an improved jobs market, Zyblock said. A Labor Department
report last week showed jobless claims last week fell by 34,000
to 407,000, the lowest level since July 2008.  Beating Estimates  RBC’s S&P 500 earnings forecast equates to a roughly 8.6
percent gain from this year’s $81 a share, according to today’s
note. The average estimate among stock analysts is for earnings
to increase to $96.53 a share in 2011, Bloomberg data show.
About 71 percent of S&P 500 companies beat their earnings
estimates last quarter, marking the sixth straight period in
which more than  70 percent  of companies exceeded forecasts.
That’s the longest stretch since at least 1993.  Cost cuts have boosted results in 2010, expanding the
average profit  margin  for companies outside the financial
industry to about 11 percent, the highest since 2005, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zyblock said that while he
expects margins to flatten next year, revenue should grow 6
percent, leading earnings higher.  Risks to expansion next year include the European sovereign
debt crisis and the Korean conflict, Zyblock said.  There is “downside acceleration possible on the back of
more negative news out of Europe or Korean peninsula,” he
wrote. “We recommend that investors maintain a positive
strategic bias towards the equity market and tactically add
exposure on pullbacks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
