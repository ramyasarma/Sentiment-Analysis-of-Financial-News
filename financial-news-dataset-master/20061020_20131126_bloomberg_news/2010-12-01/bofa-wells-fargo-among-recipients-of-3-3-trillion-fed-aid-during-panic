Bank of America Corp.  and Wells Fargo
& Co. were among the top borrowers from the Term Auction
Facility, one of the Federal Reserve’s first and longest-lasting
efforts to combat the financial crisis.  Bank of America had three loans for $15 billion each
outstanding from the facility as of Jan. 15, 2009, while Wells
Fargo had three loans for $15 billion each on Feb. 26, 2009,
according to documents released today by the Fed to comply with
orders from Congress to identify recipients of emergency aid.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  created the TAF in December
2007 to let banks obtain cheaper funding without risking the
stigma of loans from the central bank’s discount window. Under
the program, banks bid for Fed loans at a rate determined
through auctions. Borrowing peaked at $493.1 billion in March
2009 and began declining until the TAF closed in April 2010.  Because the program lent to banks, the Fed didn’t invoke an
emergency legal clause allowing borrowing by non-banks in
“unusual and exigent circumstances.” The central bank used the
provision in 2008 to set up loan facilities for investment
banks, money-market mutual funds and corporations.  “The funding and guarantee programs were an example of a
successful government initiative at no taxpayer expense,” said
 Robert Stickler , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America. “The programs enabled the U.S. financial
system to continue to operate, preventing a recession from
becoming much more severe.”  Wells Fargo spokeswoman  Mary Eshet  declined to comment.  The Fed announced the TAF after the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, for one-month loans rose to 5.25 percent
in December 2007 from 4.66 percent the prior month, even after
the Fed reduced its  benchmark  short-term rate to 4.5 percent
from 5.25 percent.  The initial TAF loans carried an interest rate of 4.65
percent. TAF started with loans maturing in 28 days; from August
2008 through October 2009, the Fed also offered 84-day loans
through auctions. The TAF data disclosed by the Fed included a
total of 4,214 transactions.  Societe Generale  Banks with headquarters outside the U.S. were among the
first to begin using the facility in December 2007 and were also
among its heaviest borrowers. These included the U.S. affiliates
of banks such as Manama, Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp.,
Madrid-based Banco Santander SA, and Paris-based Societe
Generale SA. Beginning on June 18, 2009, Barclays Bank Plc had
two loans totaling $23.45 billion outstanding.  Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. also availed
themselves of the TAF. Citigroup’s Citibank NA subsidiary had
three loans under the facility totaling $20 billion on Jan. 15,
2009. JPMorgan’s JPMorgan Chase Bank NA had two loans totaling
$25 billion on Feb. 26, 2009.  In a footnote, the Fed reported that for two loans, the
borrowers did not have adequate collateral on the day the loan
settled. “The Federal Reserve worked with all relevant parties
to obtain adequate collateral and to guard against any
recurrence of similar problems,” the report said. The loans
were repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
