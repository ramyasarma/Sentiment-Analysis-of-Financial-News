Japan’s sale of 2.2 trillion yen ($26
billion) in 10-year bonds may have a lowest-accepted price of
100.10, according to the median forecast of 14 traders surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  Estimates for the lowest-accepted price of the 1.2 percent
bonds ranged from 100.01 to 100.13, according to the survey.  Five traders said 100.10, two each said 100.13, 100.12 and
100.04, and one each reported 100.08, 100.05 and 100.01.  The lowest-accepted price is the minimum at which the
government sells the securities. The Ministry of Finance will
announce the results at 12:45 p.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
