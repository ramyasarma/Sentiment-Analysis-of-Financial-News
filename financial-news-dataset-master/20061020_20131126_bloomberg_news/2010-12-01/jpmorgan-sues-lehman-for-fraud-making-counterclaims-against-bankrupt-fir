Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
completed a $1.6 billion plan to save Aurora Bank FSB and
Woodlands Commercial Bank from being seized by regulators, said
 Douglas Lambert , a director of the two banks.  After a settlement with regulators, “both institutions are
now well capitalized, and can resume normal banking operations
for the first time in 26 months,” he said in an interview
today.  Bankrupt Lehman said in September that past and future
capital infusions into the banks would total $1.6 billion. By
spending the money, Lehman aimed to save creditors from
potential priority claims of $2.7 billion and recoup an
estimated liquidation value of $2 billion, it said in a
September filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. Lehman
said it planned to sell or close the banks.  The infusion was completed this week in a closing with
regulators, said Lambert, an executive of the Alvarez & Marsal
restructuring firm that runs Lehman’s bankruptcy. If the banks
had failed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s insurance fund
and creditors of Lehman would have been losers, he said.  Woodlands is based in Salt Lake City. Aurora is in
Wilmington, Delaware.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
