Europe’s “distress” is being
reflected in the rising dollar’s performance, which can be
regarded as a “flight to safety,” said Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas President Richard Fisher.  The dollar proved to be last month’s best investment,
beating stocks, bonds and commodities, confounding officials
around the world who said Federal Reserve policies would debase
the U.S. currency. Fisher spoke to reporters after a speech
today in Texas.   To contact the reporter on this story:
