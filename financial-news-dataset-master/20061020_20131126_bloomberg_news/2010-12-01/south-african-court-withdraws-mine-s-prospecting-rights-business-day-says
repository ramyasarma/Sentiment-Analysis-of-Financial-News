South Africa’s Constitutional Court
yesterday withdrew prospecting rights awarded to Nkwe Platinum
Ltd.’s Genorah Resources because the community that owned the
land wasn’t properly consulted, Business Day said.  Genorah lost its right to prospect for platinum group
metals at the Nooitverwacht and Eerste Geluk farms owned by the
Bengwenyama-ye-Maswati people, on the eastern limb of the
country’s Bushveld Complex, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said, citing the judgment.  Nkwe will “engage” South Africa’s Department of Mineral
Resources to ensure its rights remain intact, the Perth-based
company said in a statement to Australia’s stock exchange today.
Xtrata Plc, which has an option to buy as much as 50 percent of
one or more of Nkwe’s properties, declined to comment on the
ruling when contacted by Business Day yesterday, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
