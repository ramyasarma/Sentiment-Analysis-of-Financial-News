Absa Group Ltd., South Africa’s
biggest home-loans provider, will limit its business with
mortgage originators and change the way it deals with estate
agents, Sake24 reported.  Buyers using mortgage originators will need a deposit of 60
percent of the property’s value before a home loan will be
considered by Absa, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited a
letter from the lender to Bond Choice Home Loans as saying. Most
South Africans have home loans of 80 percent of the value of
their properties, Sake24 said.  Estate agents will need to use Findex, an independent
mortgage origination company owned by black investors, when
applying for a home loan on behalf of their customers, Sake24
said. Absa remains “serious” about growing mortgage lending,
the newspaper cited Gavin Opperman, the head of small business
at the company, as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
