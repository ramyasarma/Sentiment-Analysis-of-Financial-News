Gold futures rose for the third
straight day, touching the highest level in more than two weeks,
as Europe’s debt woes boosted demand for a haven.  Investors are shunning Europe’s highest-rated bonds after
bailouts for Greece and Ireland failed to ease concern that the
debt crisis will spread. The cost of insuring Portuguese,
Spanish and Italian bonds rose to records, and gold priced in
euros reached an all-time high.  “Gold is swiftly becoming the next reservable currency,”
said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia Gartman Letter.  Gold futures for February delivery rose $2.20, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1,388.30 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $1,398.30, the
highest since Nov. 12. The metal reached a record $1,424.30 on
Nov. 9.  Gold may average $1,500 next year and $1,600 in 2012,  Anne- Laure Tremblay , a London-based analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said
in a report. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects prices to peak at
$1,750 in 2012.  Silver rose as much as 2.4 percent after surging 15 percent
in November, the most since May 2009. Deliveries for the
December futures contract have been “extremely light,” said
Frank McGhee, the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
in Chicago.  Silver Deliveries  The number of contracts pledged for delivery totaled 34
yesterday, down from 56 contracts on Nov. 29, according to Comex
data. Last December, 2,748 contracts were delivered. Open
interest in the December contract is 1,945 contracts.  “There’s a lot of talk that there might not be any silver
to be delivered,” said Lannie Cohen, the president of  Capitol
Commodity Services Inc.  in Indianapolis. “If they don’t have
the metal to deliver, the price will have to go up.”  Silver futures for March delivery gained 20.1 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $28.413 an ounce. The price has jumped 69 percent
this year, reaching a 30-year high of $29.34 on Nov. 9.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose $29.30, or 4.2
percent, to $732.30 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Platinum futures for January delivery advanced $17.60,
or 1.1 percent, to $1,684 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
