The United Nations will appeal for
$530 million to fund 229 humanitarian projects in Somalia, the
 UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  said.  The money will be used next year “to respond to the most
urgent humanitarian needs in Somalia,” the agency said in an e-
mailed statement today in Nairobi, the capital of neighboring
Kenya. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will
conduct the appeal.  Two good rainy seasons this year in Somalia have helped to
improve crop yields, reducing the number of people “in crisis”
by a quarter, to 2 million, the UN said yesterday.  Workers providing humanitarian relief in Somalia face
regular intrusions from armed groups, while eight aid
organizations are banned from the southern and central regions,
OCHA said. Local organizations in partnership with the UN have
taken over the delivery of services in the affected areas, the
agency said.  Rebel fighters from groups including al-Shabaab, which has
pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda, have been battling the U.S.-backed
Somali government for the past three years.  Most of southern and central Somalia is controlled by
rebels, while President  Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed ’s
government controls only portions of the capital, Mogadishu.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991,
and the chaos has made it one of the world’s poorest countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
