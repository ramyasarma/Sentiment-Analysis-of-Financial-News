Prudential Plc  plans to double profit
in Asia within the next three years as the U.K.’s biggest
insurer outlined a growth strategy following its failed bid for
 AIA Group Ltd.   Prudential wants to raise pretax operating profit in Asia
to about 930 million pounds ($1.6 billion) by 2013 from 465
million pounds in 2009, the London-based insurer said today in a
statement. Chief Executive Officer  Tidjane Thiam  will announce
the plan at an investor conference in London today.  “We view these as challenging especially given the current
economic climate,”  Eamonn Flanagan , a Liverpool, England-based
analyst from Shore Capital Group Ltd. wrote in a note to clients
today. “The question remains unanswered as to what the group
aims to do with all this cash.”  Thiam is redoubling his efforts to squeeze profit and
growth from the company’s existing Asian division after an
investor rebellion caused him to drop his bid to buy American
International Group Inc.’s Asian unit for $35.5 billion earlier
this year. The purchase would have more than doubled the size of
the insurer and been its biggest acquisition on record.  Prudential  rose  23.5 pence, or 4.1 percent, to 591.5 pence
at 8:46 a.m. in London trading, valuing the firm at about 15.1
billion pounds.  Generating Cash  The insurer also plans to double profit from new business
in Asia to about 1.4 billion pounds by 2013 from the 713 million
pounds it made in 2009. The region will aim to generate 300
million pounds in cash by 2013 compared with 40 million pounds
in 2009, Prudential said. Insurers typically use cash to pay
dividends and invest in new business.  “The objectives for Asia reflect our belief that Asia will
continue to offer the highest growth and highest return
opportunities for a generation or more,” Thiam said in the
statement. “Market conditions in Asia continue to be positive,
with Asian economies performing strongly in spite of a
challenging global environment.”  The investor day will reveal no new information on current
trading, Prudential said.  Prudential Plc is a separate company from and has had no
historical relation to Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential
Financial Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
