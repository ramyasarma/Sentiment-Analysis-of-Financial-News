Serm Suk Pcl , the Thai bottler of
 PepsiCo Inc.  beverages, fell the most in at least two decades in
Bangkok trading as a tender offer for its shares is scheduled to
end tomorrow.  Serm Suk  slid  19 percent to 47 baht at the 4:30 p.m. close,
the steepest decline since at least 1990, when Bloomberg data
was available. That made it the worst  performer  in the 479-
member  SET Index , which rose 1.3 percent.  SS National Logistics Co. will close its offer to buy all
remaining shares in  Serm Suk  tomorrow. Closely held SS National,
which offered to buy the stock at 42 baht each, said Nov. 26 it
acquired 31.9 percent of the company during the tender offer.  “ Serm Suk ’s recent rally is purely on the story about the
battle to take majority control of the company,”  Parin Kitchatornpitak , an analyst at Far East Securities Co. in
Bangkok, said by telephone. “Without that, the current share
price is at a ridiculous level far beyond its true
fundamentals.”  The beverage maker, whose biggest  shareholder  is PepsiCo,
has more than doubled in  market value  since the U.S. beverage
company announced in April an offer to buy shares it didn’t
already own at a 44 percent premium to the closing price before
the announcement.  PepsiCo  later scrapped the proposed acquisition after the
company’s board rejected the offering price as too low and it
failed to acquire enough shares from investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
