Morocco will sign three or four oil
and natural-gas exploration agreements with international
companies next month, said M’Hammed El Moustaine, director of
exploration at the government’s energy regulatory body.  Office National Des Hydrocarbures et Des Mines, also known
as ONYM, is currently in negotiations with the companies over
six offshore and onshore blocks, El Moustaine said in an
interview in Marrakech, declining to identify the companies.  “The value of the contracts will depend on the talks and
the characteristics of the blocks under negotiation,” he said.  Morocco wants to attract more foreign companies to explore
for oil and gas to increase its energy supply security as energy
consumption is expected to grow by between 5 percent and 6
percent a year, according to El Moustaine.  There are 28 foreign companies working in Morocco,
including  Circle Oil Plc  and Repsol YPF SA, both of which made
small discoveries, El Moustaine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
