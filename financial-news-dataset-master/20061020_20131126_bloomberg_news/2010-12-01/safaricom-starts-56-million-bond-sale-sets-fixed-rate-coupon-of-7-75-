Safaricom Ltd. , the mobile-phone
operator that is  Kenya’s  biggest company by market value,
started the sale of 4.49 billion shillings ($56 million) of
five-year bonds today.  The fixed-rate securities will pay a coupon of 7.75 percent
a year, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The bonds will start trading on the  Nairobi Stock
Exchange  on Jan. 17.  The floating-rate coupon is the prevailing 182-day
treasury-bill rate plus 185 basis points, Safaricom Public
Relations Officer Wachira Kang’aru said by phone from Nairobi
today. The weighted average rate of accepted bids was 2.464
percent at the most recent auction, while the cut-off rate was
2.8 percent, the Central Bank of Kenya said on Nov. 25.  “Interest will be paid semi-annually in arrears beginning
May 2, 2011,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
