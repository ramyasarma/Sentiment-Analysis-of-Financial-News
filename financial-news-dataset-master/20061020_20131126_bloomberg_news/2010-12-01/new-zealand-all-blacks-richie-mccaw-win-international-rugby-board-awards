New Zealand’s All Blacks won the
three major prizes at the International Rugby Board’s annual
awards, a year before the nation hosts the Rugby World Cup.  Captain Richie McCaw became the first man to win the IRB
Player of the Year in consecutive years, and also the first to
win the accolade three times, the IRB said in an e-mailed
statement. Graham Henry was named Coach of the Year and the All
Blacks were Team of the Year for the fourth time in six years.  The top-ranked All Blacks last won the World Cup in 1987.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
