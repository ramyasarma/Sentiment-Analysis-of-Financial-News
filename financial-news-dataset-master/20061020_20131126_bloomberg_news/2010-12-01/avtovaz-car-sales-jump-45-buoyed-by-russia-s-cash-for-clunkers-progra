OAO AvtoVAZ , Russia’s largest
automaker, said domestic sales rose 45.3 percent in the first 11
months from the same period last year to 467,550 vehicles as the
government’s cash-for-clunkers program boosted demand.  The company’s sales “more than doubled” in November to
49,534 vehicles, AvtoVAZ said in an e-mailed statement today
without giving figures for 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
