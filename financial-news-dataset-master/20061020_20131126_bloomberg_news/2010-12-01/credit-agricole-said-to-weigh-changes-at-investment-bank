Credit Agricole SA , France’s third-
largest bank by market value, is planning changes in senior
management at its corporate- and investment-banking unit, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Patrick Valroff , chief executive officer of the division
since 2008, may step down as Credit Agricole CEO  Jean-Paul Chifflet  shuffles the leadership nine months after taking the
top job, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the matter is confidential.  Jean-Yves Hocher , 55, Credit
Agricole’s deputy CEO overseeing the investment bank, insurance
and asset management, is a candidate to replace Valroff, one
person said.  Valroff, 61, may move to a different role at the division,
they said.  Alain Massiera , deputy CEO of the unit, and  Gilles de Dumast , head of coverage and investment banking and a member of
the Credit Agricole CIB executive committee, may also change
roles, the people said.  Valroff took over the unit from  Marc Litzler  following
subprime-related losses, and helped return it to profit.  Credit Agricole will make a statement relating to its
corporate- and investment-banking unit later today, a Paris-
based spokeswoman said by phone. She declined to comment on
possible management changes at the division. A spokeswoman at
the investment bank also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
