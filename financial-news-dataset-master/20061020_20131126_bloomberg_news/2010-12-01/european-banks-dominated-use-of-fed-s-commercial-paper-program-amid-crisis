The U.S. subsidiaries of European
financial institutions, led by Zurich-based UBS AG and Brussels-
based Dexia SA were among the largest users of a government
program to provide emergency short-term funding to U.S.
companies and banks during the credit crisis.  Six European banks were among the top 11 companies that
sold the most debt overall to the Commercial Paper Funding
Facility. They sold a combined $274.1 billion, according to data
made public today by the U.S. central bank. UBS sold $74.5
billion, the most among all borrowers. The largest U.S.-based
user was insurer American International Group, selling $60.2
billion.  UBS’s figure of $74.5 billion represents the company’s
total sales over the life of the program. The bank’s CPFF
borrowings peaked at $37.2 billion, an amount the firm rolled
over, or re-sold at maturity, once. Other companies rolled over
debt in the program as well.  The CPFF was the only Fed program during the crisis that
lent directly to non-financial companies, including Peoria,
Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc., and Harley-Davidson
Inc. in Milwaukee. None of the debt purchased defaulted and the
Fed earned $6.1 billion in interest income and usage fees
through CPFF, according to the Federal Reserve.  The Fed released details about the commercial paper
facility to meet disclosure requirements in the Dodd-Frank
financial-oversight law signed by President Barack Obama in
July. The central bank has never before revealed specific,
transaction-level aspects of its lending.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
