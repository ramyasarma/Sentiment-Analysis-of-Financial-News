Coal producers that ship from
Australia’s Newcastle port, the world’s biggest harbor for
power-station fuel, are seeking a 35 percent increase in export
capacity by 2014, according to a terminal operator.  Coal companies want shipping capacity to rise to 153
million metric tons a year from 113 million tons now, Port
Waratah Coal Services Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement today.
Documentation on the development of an additional terminal will
be submitted to the New South Wales government “in coming
days,” Port Waratah said.  Xstrata Plc,  BHP Billiton Ltd.  and Anglo American Plc are
among mining companies that ship the fuel from the harbor, which
has three export terminals. Coal imports by China are forecast
to increase by 80 million tons in the next three years,
according to an Oct. 19 note from Deutsche Bank AG. China
shipped in 125.8 million tons of the fuel last year, customs
figures show.  Port Waratah, operator of two of the terminals, in February
approved a A$670 million ($642 million) expansion that will take
its capacity to 133 million tons by the end of 2011. Studies are
underway to raise capacity to 145 million tons by the end of
2012, the company said today.  Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group, partly owned by BHP
Billiton, operates the third terminal, which has a capacity of
30 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
