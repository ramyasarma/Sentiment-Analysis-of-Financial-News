Sharp Corp. , Japan’s largest maker of
solar panels, said it will invest 15 billion yen ($180 million)
in a new production line to meet the rising demand for cells.  Sharp is adding an annual production capacity of 200
megawatts in single crystalline silicon solar at its factory in
Sakai City, Japan, according to a statement today. The mass
production of cells and modules will start by March, the Osaka-
based company said.  Sharp in October forecast  revenue  from solar batteries may
rise 34 percent to 280 billion yen in the 12 months to March
from a year earlier. Annual shipments will probably increase 64
percent to 1,300 megawatts, it said.  The solar modules to be produced at the new line will have
an energy efficiency of 17 percent, up from about 14 percent for
the company’s similar models, according to  Sharp . The company
plans to improve the rate to 20 percent in future, Tetsuo
Onishi, head of the renewable energy business, said at a press
conference in Tokyo today.  Sharp’s overall production capacity of solar cells will
increase to 1,230 megawatts by the end of 2011, from 870
megawatts currently, Onishi said. That includes production at
its venture in Italy which will likely start in the second half
of next year, he said.  Enel SpA’s Green Power unit, chipmaker
STMicroelectronics NV and Sharp said in January they will
jointly make thin-film solar panels at a factory in Catania,
Sicily, with an initial annual production capacity of 160
megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
