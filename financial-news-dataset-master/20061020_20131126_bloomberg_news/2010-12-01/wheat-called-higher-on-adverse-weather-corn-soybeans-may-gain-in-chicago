What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 22 cents to 27 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade
and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange on mounting concern that
adverse weather reduced global production and crop quality, said
 Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  -- Soybean futures may open 15 cents to 20 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT on speculation that Chinese demand for imports of
oilseeds and cooking oils will increase, Schultz said. Soybean-
meal futures may open $1.50 to $2.50 higher per 2,000 pounds,
and soybean oil is expected to open up 0.8 cent to 0.9 cent a
pound.  -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on bets that China’s demand for U.S. imports
of the grain will climb, Schultz said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
