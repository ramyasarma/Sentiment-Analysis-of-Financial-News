Li Ka-shing’s Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
will buy 14.1 million shares in  Husky Energy Inc.  for C$345.5
million ($337 million) under a private placement by the Canadian
oil producer, also controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire.  Hutchison will acquire the shares at C$24.50 apiece through
a wholly owned unit, the Hong Kong-listed company said in a
statement to the city’s stock exchange. Husky fell 0.4 percent
to close at C$24.47 in Toronto trading yesterday.  Husky aims to raise about $1 billion for acquisitions, debt
payment and capital spending by offering about $293 million of
shares to the public and a combined $707 million of stock to its
main holders including Hutchison, the Calgary, Alberta-based
company said Nov. 29. All 11.9 million shares are being offered
at the same price.  Hutchison’s stake in Husky will remain unchanged at 34.55
percent after the transaction, the Hong Kong company said.  Husky said Nov. 29 that it has agreed to buy C$860 million
of oil and natural-gas properties in western Canada from Exxon
Mobil Corp., adding production and reserves in areas where it’s
already operating. The deal is part of C$4.86 billion in planned
capital spending next year, a 20 percent increase.  The Canadian energy producer will sell stock to finance its
expansion, including initial development of the Sunrise oil-
sands project it shares with BP Plc and a planned venture in
Southeast Asia with China National Offshore Oil Corp., Husky
said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
