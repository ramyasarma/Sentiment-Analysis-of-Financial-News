Oil traded near $84 a barrel in New
York after falling amid concern Europe’s debt crisis may crimp
economic growth and demand for fuel.  Futures dropped 1.9 percent yesterday after the dollar
gained to highest in more than 10 weeks against the euro as
Portuguese, Italian and Spanish government bonds slumped and
global stocks slipped. A report from the American Petroleum
Institute showed U.S. fuel inventories rose last week.  “With so much uncertainty in the market place, we could
easily see the price of oil go back down to $81 and possibly
test $80,” said  Mike Sander , of Sander Capital Advisors in
Seattle. “Portugal is likely next on the bailout wagon, and
Spain is close.”  The January contract was at $84.20 a barrel, up 9 cents, in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:14
p.m. Sydney time. Earlier, it declined as much as 0.6 percent to
$83.63. Yesterday, it lost $1.62 to $84.11. Prices added 3.3
percent last month and are up 5.8 percent this year.  The euro decreased 1.1 percent to $1.2983 in New York
yesterday, after reaching $1.2969, the lowest since Sept. 15. A
stronger dollar curbs investor demand for raw materials.  Concern that Europe’s debt crisis will worsen has shifted
to Portugal and Spain since Nov. 28, when the region’s
governments sought to bolster the euro by giving Ireland an 85
billion-euro ($111 billion) rescue package.  Fuel Supplies  U.S. stockpiles of distillates, which include heating oil
and diesel, climbed 224,000 barrels last week to 157.5 million
barrels, according to the American Petroleum Institute. An
Energy Department report today  may show  they fell 1.1 million
barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Gasoline supplies increased 1.07 million barrels, the API
said. The Energy Department will  probably show  they gained
300,000 barrels, according to the survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Brent crude for January settlement slumped $1.42, or 1.6
percent, to $85.92 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
