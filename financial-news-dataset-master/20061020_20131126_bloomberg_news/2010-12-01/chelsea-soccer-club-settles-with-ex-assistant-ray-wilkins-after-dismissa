Chelsea soccer club settled a dispute
with former assistant coach Ray Wilkins, who had said his Nov.
11 departure from the team was “undoubtably unfair.”  Wilkins and the club “amicably resolved all outstanding
matters,” the League Managers Association said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The former player left after his contract wasn’t renewed,
and was replaced by Michael Emenalo, the team’s head opposition
scout.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
