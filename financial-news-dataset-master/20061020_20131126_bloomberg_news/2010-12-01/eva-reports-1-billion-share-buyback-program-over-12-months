Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
will buy back as much as $1 billion in shares and American
depositary receipts over the next 12 months.  Teva will use its own cash to fund the share repurchase
program and may buy back the stock either in the open market or
in private transactions, the Petah Tikva, Israel-based company
said today in a statement.  The program, which has been approved by the board, isn’t
expected to affect the  company ’s goal to reach $31 billion in
revenue and $6.8 billion in net income by 2015, Teva said. The
generic drugmaker is also sticking to its plan to make
additional acquisitions.  “It’s a good sign and it shows that management thinks the
stock is cheap,”  David Levinson , an analyst at Bank Hapoalim,
said in a telephone interview. “They’re also still on track
with their plans for 2015.”  Teva shares fell 1.2 percent to 185.50 shekels in Tel Aviv.
The stock has lost about 13 percent this year, compared with a
2.8 percent rise in the  Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
