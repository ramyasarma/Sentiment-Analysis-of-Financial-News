Crude oil storage capacity at U.S.
terminals stood at 385.6 million barrels, the Energy Department
said today in a  report .  Capacity in Cushing, Oklahoma, the biggest U.S. trading
hub, is 55 million barrels, according to the department. Working
capacity, or the maximum amount of useable tanks considering
space needed to keep some grades separate and coordinate
pipeline shipments, is 45.9 million barrels.  Crude-oil inventories at Cushing, the delivery point for
New York futures,  rose 910,000  barrels to 34.5 million last
week, the Energy Department said today. Supplies at the hub were
at 75 percent of capacity, based on the working capacity.  The amount of U.S. crude oil storage that is leased out is
39 percent. At Cushing, the largest U.S. trading hub, 59 percent
of the capacity is leased to others, according to the
department.  Today’s report is the first to show capacities at
terminals. The data will be released on a semi-annual basis, the
Energy Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
