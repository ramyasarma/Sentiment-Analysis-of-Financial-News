India, the fourth-biggest producer of
natural rubber, may allow imports of as much as 100,000 metric
tons at a lower duty to meet surging demand for tires as rising
incomes boost car sales, Trade Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said.  The finance ministry may make a decision after the end of
the current session of parliament which runs to Dec. 13, Khullar
said in an interview in New Delhi yesterday. The trade ministry
has recommended imports at a concessional rate for a maximum of
100,000 tons and tax changes on tire imports, he said, declining
to elaborate. Rubber imports are taxed at 20 percent.  Rising incomes in the world’s second-most populous nation
may help more than double annual car sales to 3 million by 2015,
according to the government, boosting demand for natural rubber.
 Prices  in India reached a record last month on concern that the
low-output season in Southeast Asia will worsen a deficit.  “Domestic production is not going to increase dramatically,
demand is going through the roof because factories are being set
up to make radial tires,” Khullar said. “The pressure on
prices will continue tight through next year, until you resolve
the availability issue.”  Bridgestone Corp.  and its Indian rivals including  Apollo
Tyres Ltd.  and  MRF Ltd.  are investing $3 billion in plants to
meet demand that’s forecast by Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’
Association to expand 10 percent to 106 million tires in the
year to March 31. Rubber makes up 42 percent of raw material
costs, according to the manufacturers’ group.  Stocks Rally  Tire makers’ shares jumped in Mumbai trading. Apollo gained
as much as 2.7 percent to 67.9 rupees, after losing 7.7 percent
last month.  JK Tyre & Industries Ltd.  added as much as 3 percent
to 149.4 rupees and MRF climbed 3 percent to 8,100 rupees.  Futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange reached a 30-year
high of 383 yen on Nov. 11 as rain in Thailand, Indonesia and
Malaysia, the top three growers, interrupted tapping and lowered
production. May-delivery rubber on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
gained as much as 1 percent to 363.8 yen per kilogram ($4,351 a
ton) before settling at 363.5 yen.  Passenger-vehicle  sales  in India in October increased 38
percent from a year ago to a record 231,957 units, the Society
of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said on Nov. 10. About 1.4
million units were sold in the April-October period, compared
with 1.53 million for the whole of the last fiscal year,
according to the group.  “Demand-supply gap has been widening over the past two to
three years because of stagnant rubber production and rising car
sales,” said  Vaishali Jajoo , an analyst with Mumbai-based Angel
Broking. “There will be imports in the coming years if there’s
no fresh supply and the auto sector continues to do well.”  She has a “accumulate” rating on Apollo and a “buy”
recommendation on  JK Tyre.    Imports in the year to March 31 may exceed 200,000 tons,
from 170,048 tons a year earlier, tire makers association’s
Director General Rajiv Budhraja said on Nov. 11. Natural-rubber
output may drop for a second straight month in November after
falling 7.6 percent to 82,000 tons in October, as rains hinder
tapping in Kerala, India’s top producer, he said.  Purchases surged 81 percent in October to 18,148 tons,
according to the state-run  Rubber Board , as tire companies
stepped up purchases to bridge the shortage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
