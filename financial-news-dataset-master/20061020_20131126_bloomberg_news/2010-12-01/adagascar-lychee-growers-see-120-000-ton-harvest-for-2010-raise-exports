Madagascar, the biggest source of
lychee imports by Europe, will export 8.8 percent less of the
tropical fruit this year as reduced rainfall cut the size of the
fruits, the growers’ association said.  Madagascar will export 18,250 metric tons of this year’s
harvest, Narison Rafidimanana, head of the country’s Lychee
Growers’ Association, said in a telephone today from the
capital, Antananarivo. That compares with an annual average of
20,000 tons, he said.  The association of 32 growers, which represents 90 percent
of Madagascar’s lychee producers, exported 17,500 tons of the
fruit to Europe this year as it prioritized “quality rather
than quantity,” he said. “Some fruits are smaller due to less
rain but it’s not catastrophic,” Radifimanana said of this
year’s month-long harvest.  The Indian Ocean island nation, whose harvest is estimated
at 100,000 tons to 120,000 tons annually, is expected to produce
120,000 tons of the tropical fruit this year, Rafidimanana said.  Imports of lychees from the southern Indian Ocean region
represent around 80 percent of total annual imports to Europe,
with Madagascar holding around 70 percent of the market, the
European Commission  said on its website . Late rains will delay
the season by two weeks, Commerce Minister Freddie Mahazoasy
said on Nov. 25.  The industry needs to improve administration and promotion
to prevent 80 percent of the nation’s lychee output from going
to waste, Mahazoasy said. Madagascar is working toward exporting
the fruit to the U.S., whose Food and Drug Administration didn’t
accept Madagascar’s cultivation process, he said.  Lychees sell for 700 ariary ($0.34) a kilogram (2.2
pounds), Radifimanana said, declining to provide an estimate for
how much the industry was worth annually. but could not give an
estimate on how much the industry was worth per year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
