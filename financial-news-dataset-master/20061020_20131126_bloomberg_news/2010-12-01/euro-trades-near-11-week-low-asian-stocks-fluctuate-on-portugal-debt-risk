Stocks jumped, sending U.S. benchmark
indexes to their biggest gains in three months, while the euro
and commodities rallied and Treasuries slid amid improving data
on the American and Chinese economies and speculation of a
larger effort to end Europe’s debt crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.2 percent, the
most since Sept. 1. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  rose 2.2
percent, its biggest gain since Aug. 2. The euro rebounded above
$1.31 while Spanish 10-year bonds snapped an 11-day drop. The
rate on 10-year Treasury notes increased 17 basis points to 2.97
percent, a four-month high. Oil and copper advanced more than 3
percent. After the U.S. close, S&P 500 futures added 0.1 percent
at 7 p.m. in New York and Japan’s stocks rose in early trading.  U.S. equities started what is historically their best month
with a rally after ADP Employer Services data showed companies
added 93,000 jobs last month, the Federal Reserve said the
economy strengthened across most of the nation and manufacturing
in China expanded at the fastest pace in seven months. European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday that
investors are underestimating policy makers’ determination to
halt the region’s debt crisis and shore up the euro ahead of a
meeting of the bank’s Governing Council tomorrow.  “We’re working our way back,” said  David Joy , chief
market strategist at Columbia Management in Boston, which
oversees $347 billion. “The ADP number shows that we’re clearly
going in the right direction,” he said. “The strength out of
China shows that, even if there’s some tightening, they will be
successful in engineering a soft landing.”  December Rallies  The S&P 500 erased three days of declines as Exxon Mobil
Corp., Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and General Electric
Co. paced gains that sent commodity producers and industrial
companies to the top  performances  among 10 groups, all of which
rose at least 1 percent.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  surged 249.76 points, or
2.3 percent, to 11,255.78. The Dow has rallied in December more
than in any other month over the last century, according to
Bespoke Investment Group. The 30-stock gauge rose 1.3 percent on
 average  in the month during the past 100 years and gained 1.5
percent and 1.7 percent over the last 50 and 20 years,
respectively, the Bespoke data show.  Today’s gains came after a report on private payrolls
bolstered optimism before the government’s November employment
data, which is forecast to show on Dec. 3 that 145,000 jobs were
added last month. The jobs growth reported by ADP topped the
median forecast of 70,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of manufacturing in
the U.S. fell less than estimated to 56.6 for November.  IMF Speculation  Stocks and the euro extended gains after Reuters reported
that an unidentified official said the U.S. may support
enlarging a European financial rescue program by adding cash
from the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. is not discussing
extra IMF money for Europe, a U.S. official in Washington told
Bloomberg News.  The Fed’s Beige Book survey showed the economy gained
strength in 10 of 12 regions as manufacturing expanded and
retailers anticipated a stronger holiday shopping season. Five
Fed banks, including Boston and San Francisco, said the economy
grew “at a slight to modest” rate, while five others,
including New York and Chicago, reported a “somewhat stronger
pace of economic activity.” Conditions were reported as
“mixed” in the Philadelphia and St. Louis regions.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  rallied 2 percent, the most in
three months. Spain’s IBEX 35 led gains in national benchmark
gauges, surging 4.4 percent for its biggest advance since May.
Banco Santander SA, the nation’s largest lender, and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA jumped more than 7 percent.  Asian Stocks  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.9 percent. China’s
Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed to 55.2 last month, beating
the 54.8 median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. South Korean exports rose 24.6 percent from a year earlier
after gaining a revised 27.6 percent in October.  The euro appreciated against 15 of 16 major counterparts,
climbing 1.8 percent to 110.6 yen, snapping a three-day decline.
The Swiss franc slipped against 14 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts, weakening 1.1 percent versus the euro. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six trading
partners,  declined  for the first time in four days, falling 0.6
percent to 80.699.  There’s “a calm of sorts returned to financial markets,”
 Peter Frank , a currency strategist at Societe Generale SA in
London, wrote in a report today. “Both equity and commodity
prices were resilient to the ongoing European Union sovereign
crisis thanks to another bout of solid manufacturing results for
China.”  Europe Bonds  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year
bonds instead of benchmark German bunds tumbled 34 basis points
to 249 basis points. Irish 10-year yields declined 32 basis
points to 9.13 percent.  Portuguese bonds  rose , sending the 10-year yield 21 basis
points lower to 6.86 percent, as the government sold 500 million
euros ($655 million) of 12-month bills today. The auction
attracted bids for 2.5 times the amount offered, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 1.8 in November.  S&P said late yesterday it may cut Portugal’s credit rating
on concern the nation may have to seek a bailout. Yields on debt
from Italy and Spain climbed to euro-era records relative to
bunds this week, while the spread on higher-rated Belgian bonds
over bunds  increased  yesterday to the most since at least 1993.  The ECB bought Irish government bonds today, according to
three traders with knowledge of the transactions. The central
bank also purchased Portuguese debt, said two people, who asked
not to be identified because the deals are confidential. An ECB
spokesman in Frankfurt declined to comment. The ECB’s Governing
Council will meet tomorrow amid speculation it will again delay
its exit from emergency liquidity measures.  Default Swaps  The cost of insuring against a default on corporate debt
decreased, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-
default swaps on 50 mostly junk-rated European companies
declining 31 basis points to a mid-price of 494.25, according to
Markit Group Ltd. The index surged to a two-month high yesterday.  Credit default swaps insuring the government debt of
Belgium, Ireland, Spain and Portugal all decreased from records.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities gained 3 percent, the
most since May 27. Oil jumped 3.1 percent to $86.75 a barrel and
copper climbed 3.2 percent to $3.9475 a pound in New York.  Fed Buys Bonds  The 30-year Treasury yield jumped 13 basis points to 4.24
percent. The drop in U.S. bonds came even as the Fed bought $8.2
billion of Treasuries with maturities from June 2016 and
November 2017 as part of an asset-purchase program aimed at
lowering borrowing costs and stimulating economic growth. The
central bank is buying Treasuries every day this week.  Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable
Wall Street firm, increased their forecasts for U.S. and global
growth in 2011, predicted an acceleration in 2012 and
recommended investors buy banks. The U.S. economy will grow at a
2.7 percent rate next year, up from a previous forecast of 2
percent, and 3.6 percent in 2012, economists led by  Jan Hatzius 
in New York said in a report today.  The global economy will grow 4.6 percent in 2011 and 4.8
percent in 2012,  Dominic Wilson , senior global economist, said
in a separate report.  Goldman recommended U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds,
commodities, Japanese stocks and China’s currency. They are the
first of the firm’s “top trades” for 2011, they said. The
forecasts are a departure from the pessimism that characterized
Goldman Sachs’ projections since 2006.  To contact the reporters on this story:
