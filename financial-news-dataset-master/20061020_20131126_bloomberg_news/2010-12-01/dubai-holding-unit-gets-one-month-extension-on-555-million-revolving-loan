Dubai Holding Commercial Operations
Group LLC, a real estate and hospitality group owned by Dubai
Holding, received a one-month extension on a $555 million
revolving credit line until Dec. 30.  “The extension is required to finalize a new long-term
facility,” the company said in a  statement  to Nasdaq Dubai
today.  Dubai Holding Commercial in September received a two-month
extension on the loan at “commercical terms,” the second such
extension after getting one in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
