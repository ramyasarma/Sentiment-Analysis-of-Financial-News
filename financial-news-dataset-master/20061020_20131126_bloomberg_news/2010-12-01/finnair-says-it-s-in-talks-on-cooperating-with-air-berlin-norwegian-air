Finnair Oyj , Finland’s biggest
airline, said it is talking to  Norwegian Air Shuttle AS  and  Air
Berlin PLC  about cooperating on feeder traffic to lower costs.  “We have ongoing negotiations with them and have the
objective to get some kind of commercial agreement,” spokesman
 Taneli Hassinen  said about Norwegian in a phone interview.  “We would also be happy to expand our cooperation with Air
Berlin. We are very firm that we will create or be part of
production platforms that have lower costs,” he said.  Finnair already has a feeder traffic agreement with Air
Berlin on routes between Helsinki and Berlin and Dusseldorf.
That arrangement is working well and is providing competition to
other European airlines such as  Deutsche Lufthansa AG , Hassinen
said.    Finnair Chief Executive Officer  Mika Vehvilaeinen  said
yesterday the carrier would consider structural changes and
increased partnerships to cut costs as most of its flights were
cancelled after the Finnish Cabin Crew Union started a strike in
a work-rules dispute.  Finnair and the union have not agreed on when to resume
negotiations, Hassinen said. Some flight attendants have left
the union to return to work, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
