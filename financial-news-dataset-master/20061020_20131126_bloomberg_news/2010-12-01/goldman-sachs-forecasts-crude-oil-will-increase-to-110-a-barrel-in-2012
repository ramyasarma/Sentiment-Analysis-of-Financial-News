Oil futures traded in New York will
average $110 a barrel in 2012, up from a forecast of $100 a
barrel next year, according to Goldman, Sachs & Co. analysts led
by  David Greely  in New York.  “Looking toward 2012, the stage is set for a return to a
structural bull market in oil,” the analysts said in the report
dated today. The 2012 forecast is based on “the better
prospects for continued robust world economic growth.”  A 2.4 million-barrel-a-day increase in global oil demand in
2010 will be sustainable at more than 2 million barrels a day in
2011 and 2012 and require OPEC to tap into its spare capacity,
the Goldman analysts said.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had spare
capacity of 5.64 million barrels a day in November, according to
Bloomberg estimates. That compares with 2 million barrels a day
in July 2008, when New York-traded oil futures reached a record
$147.27 a barrel.  Oil for January delivery gained $2.64, or 3.1 percent, to
settle at $86.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the highest closing price since Nov. 11. Crude has averaged
$78.72 a barrel so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
