Freezing weather across Britain will
last until Dec. 8 to Dec. 10 and temperatures will rise to usual
levels for the time of year after that, according to British
Weather Services.  Snow and ice across the U.K. has made natural gas and power
the most expensive in almost two years. National Grid Plc
predicted gas demand may reach its highest level since January,
according to  information  on its website. Gas is used to heat
about 80 percent of the country’s homes and businesses and is
used to generate about half of Britain’s electricity supply.  “There will be an assault on the freeze from the Atlantic
this Saturday, which will largely fail,” Jim Dale, senior risk
meteorologist at British Weather Services, in High Wycombe,
England, said by e-mail. “The period Dec. 8 to Dec. 10 should
see a gradual change in fortunes for the U.K., Ireland and the
near continent, with temperatures heading closer to the norm for
the time of year.”  London temperatures may decline as low as minus 6 degrees
Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit) on Dec. 3 from today’s minus 5
degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data. The minimum
averaged 7 degrees over the last 10 years, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
