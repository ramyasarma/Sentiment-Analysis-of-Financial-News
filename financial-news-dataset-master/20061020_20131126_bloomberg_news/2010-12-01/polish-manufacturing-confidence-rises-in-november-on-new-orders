Central European manufacturing
expanded in November as the euro area’s economic recovery
boosted export demand, according to purchasing managers’ indexes
published today.  The HSBC PMI was 57.3 in the Czech Republic in November,
compared with 57.2 in the previous month, the bank said today in
an e-mailed report. In Poland, the Markit Economics PMI advanced
to 55.9 from 55.6 in October, the third-highest reading in the
survey’s history. In Hungary, the  PMI  rose to 54.9 from 51.5 in
October, the Hungarian Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory
Society said. A value above 50 signals growth.  East European manufacturing is expanding as most countries
in the region recover from recessions last year, helped by
rising export demand from Germany. Poland was the only country
in the European Union to avert a recession in 2009.  "It seems that the strength of industry in these countries
owes much to robust manufacturing growth in core eurozone
countries, notably Germany,"  Neil Shearing , a London-based
economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note today.  The zloty traded at 4.0227 per euro at 1:41 p.m. in Warsaw
from 4.0255 yesterday, strengthening for a second day. The
koruna firmed for the first day in five, to 24.92 per euro from
24.965 and the forint advanced for a second day to 279.92 per
euro from 280.92.  Poland’s  2010 gross domestic product  is forecast by the
government and the World Bank to grow 3.5 percent, allowing the
country to outperform other EU members for a third year.  The Czech economy may grow 2.3 percent this year, the
Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said on Nov. 4. Hungary’s
 economy , which contracted 6.7 percent last year, will grow 1.1
percent this year and 3.1 percent next year, the central bank in
Budapest said today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
