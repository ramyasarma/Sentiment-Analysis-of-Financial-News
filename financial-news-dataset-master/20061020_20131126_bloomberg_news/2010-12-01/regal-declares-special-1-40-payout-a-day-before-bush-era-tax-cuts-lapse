Regal Entertainment Group , the
largest U.S. cinema operator, declared an extraordinary dividend
of $1.40 a share payable Dec. 30, the day before Bush-era tax
cuts are set to expire.  The one-time dividend will cost about $215 million,  David Ownby , chief financial officer, said today in an interview. The
company’s largest shareholder, billionaire  Philip Anschutz ,
stands to collect more than $100 million based on his
controlling stake in the company.  The expiring Bush-era tax cuts, which included a reduction
in the levy on dividends to 15 percent, were a factor in the
decision, Ownby said. Regal, operator of 6,703 screens, has paid
four special dividends since 2002, according to Ownby and  data
compiled by Bloomberg . The Obama administration and Congress are
negotiating over a possible extension of the lower rate.  “At this point in time, we felt like the best use of this
cash was to return value to our shareholders,” Ownby said.  The dividend is payable to shareholders of record on Dec.
20, according to a statement today. The regular quarterly payout
will increase 17 percent to 21 cents a share from 18 cents
previously, the Knoxville, Tennessee-based theater operator said
in the statement. The payment increase will cost the company
about $4.5 million a quarter, Ownby said.  Regal rose 30 cents to $14.06 after the announcement and
the close of regular New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The stock gained 26 cents to $13.76 at 4:15 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
