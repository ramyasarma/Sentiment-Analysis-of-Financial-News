A novel about a high-school girl who
takes inspiration from the teachings of  Peter Drucker , the
Austrian-born management consultant who died in 2005, is set to
become Japan’s biggest seller this year.  “What If the Female Assistant of a High-School Baseball
Team Read Drucker’s ‘Management’,” written by Natsumi Iwasaki,
sold 1.21 million copies in the year ended Nov. 21, beating out
 Haruki Murakami ’s “1Q84” and a dieting guide, database
provider  Oricon Inc.  said today on its  website .  Iwasaki’s story is about a teenager named Minami who is
trying to help her high school’s baseball team get into Japan’s
national tournament at Koshien stadium. After mistakenly picking
up  Drucker’s  “Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices”
in a store, she decides to read through the 1973 book and apply
his methods in her dealings with both players and coaches.  “Japanese loved the book because they want advice for
living in an uncertain world,” Eiji Hiruma, a spokesman for
Diamond Inc., the book’s publisher, said today by telephone.
“Drucker sticks to basic principles, so what he said can be
applied to almost anyone.”  Drucker, who was born in Vienna and studied at Frankfurt
University before moving to the U.S. in 1937, taught at several
colleges before joining the faculty of the Claremont Graduate
School in California. His work has been cited by business
leaders including former General Electric Co. CEO  Jack Welch  and
Intel Corp.’s  Andrew Grove .  To contact the reporter on this story:
