Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s
biggest lender, said it last week sold two bonds backed by
residential mortgages worth 1.7 billion rand ($242 million) as
part of its securitization program.  The sale, which was concluded on Nov. 22, included a 1.1
billion rand note with an expected maturity on Nov. 21, 2015,
that was priced to yield 160 basis points more than the three-
month Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate, Reynold Leegerstee,
Standard Bank’s head of securitisation, said in a telephone
interview today. Standard Bank also sold a 560 million note with
an expected maturity of Nov. 21, 2011, priced at 75 basis over
so-called three-month Jibar, he said from Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
