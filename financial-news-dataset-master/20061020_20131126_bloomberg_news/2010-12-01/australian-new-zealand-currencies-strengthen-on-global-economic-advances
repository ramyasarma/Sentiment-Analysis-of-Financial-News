The Australian and New Zealand
dollars strengthened versus their U.S. counterpart, erasing
earlier declines, as positive economic data from Europe to China
increased demand for assets linked to growth.  The Aussie earlier fell after a government report showed
the nation’s economy grew in the third quarter at half the pace
analysts forecast. China’s manufacturing purchasing managers
index rose more than forecast. The New Zealand dollar gained
against the greenback amid speculation the European Central Bank
may act to prevent the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  “The Chinese PMI, stronger data out of Europe and the U.S.
is all pointing toward some sort of growth, and that’s directly
helping the Aussie dollar rebound,” said  Dean Popplewell , an
analyst in Toronto at the online currency-trading firm Oanda
Corp. “The world is slightly changing toward risk
appreciation.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to 96.41 U.S. cents at
11:39 a.m. in New York, from 95.88 cents yesterday. Earlier it
fell as much as 0.5 percent to touch 95.37 cents, the lowest
level since Sept. 24. The currency climbed 1.2 percent to 81.17
yen, from 80.23 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.5 percent
to 74.65 U.S. cents, from 74.26 cents yesterday, when it
declined to 73.98, the lowest level since Oct. 5. The kiwi
appreciated 1.1 percent to 62.84 yen, from 62.14 yen.  European Manufacturing  Europe’s manufacturing industries expanded at the fastest
pace in four months in November, led by Germany, the region’s
largest economy, data showed. A gauge for the 16-nation euro
area rose to 55.3, from 54.6 in the previous month, London-based
Markit Economics said today.  The euro rose against most major counterparts on
speculation ECB policy makers at a meeting tomorrow will signal
their willingness to act to curb spread of the region’s
sovereign-debt problem.  The Chinese manufacturing measure rose to 55.2 in November,
from 54.7 the prior month, a report from the nation’s logistics
federation showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a reading of 54.8. China is Australia’s largest
trading partner.  The Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index showed U.S. manufacturing expanded for a 16th
straight month in November.  Australia’s dollar earlier weakened after the Bureau of
Statistics said gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent last
quarter from the previous three months. Economists forecast a
0.4 percent gain, according to a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
