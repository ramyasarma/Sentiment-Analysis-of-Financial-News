Brazil’s  Federal Accounting Council 
is probing  Carrefour SA ’s local auditors after the world’s
second-largest retailer reported writedowns at its Brazilian
unit that were more than three times higher than expected.  “The council will form a working group that will establish
the kind of information we’ll request,” Juarez Domingues
Carneiro, the council’s president, said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Paris. “It’s necessary to investigate the
responsibilities. The council will investigate whether there was
a fraud.”  The probe into accountants at Deloitte & Touche LLP comes
less than a month after the council, an industry group with
power to fine, suspend or ban accountants from working, began
looking into auditors of  Banco Panamericano SA , the Sao Paulo-
based bank that required a 2.5 billion-real ($1.5 billion)
bailout after regulators found accounting irregularities.
Deloitte, based in New York, also worked for Panamericano.  Carrefour’s one-time charges in Brazil will total 550
million euros ($722.8 million) this year, up from an October
estimate of 180 million euros, the Paris-based company said Nov.
30. Carrefour replaced its management team in Brazil and hired
KPMG LLP to audit the unit’s accounts, the retailer said in
October. Carrefour will co-operate with any investigation by
authorities in Brazil, a company official said yesterday.  Deloitte said in a statement yesterday it hasn’t been
alerted by Carrefour on the adjustments to its financial results
for this year, and the accounting firm can’t comment on the
changes.  Shares Fall  Carrefour  rose 2.8 percent to 33.83 euros in Paris trading.
The stock dropped 5.6 percent yesterday, its biggest decline
since May. Panamericano gained 2.7 percent to 4.60 reais in São
Paulo trading at 1 p.m. New York time. The bank has plummeted 32
percent since Nov. 9, when the rescue was disclosed and the
central bank opened an investigation, through yesterday.
Prosecutors have since begun a probe into allegations of fraud
at the bank.  Grupo  Silvio Santos , the bank’s controlling shareholder,
said after the bailout that it hired PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
to investigate  Panamericano ’s accounting irregularities,
according to an e-mail from the group’s press office.
Panamericano also replaced its board and chief executive
officer. Deloitte sent a statement at the time declining to
comment.  Carrefour has also commissioned a separate probe to
determine who may be responsible for the changes.  Two Cases  “In the past month, two cases appeared,” Carneiro said.
“It may be isolated situations or it may have something that we
don’t know.”  Depending on the outcome of the investigations, accountants
may be warned, fined, suspended or banned, Sergio Prado de
Mello, the council’s vice president for oversight, ethics and
discipline, said in a telephone interview in Sao Paulo
yesterday. The council is first collecting data, including
financial statements, Mello said.  “Then we’ll ask the auditing company to make its case,”
Mello said. The council, which gained the power in June to ban
accountants from the profession, has never taken such an action,
he said.  Brazil’s Federal Accountant Council received documents from
the country’s central bank on Panamericano on Nov. 25, Carneiro
said. He said the council is still waiting for Panamericano and
Deloitte to file the documents to proceed with the
investigation. Deloitte said it didn’t receive any request from
the council seeking information on Panamericano, according to an
e-mailed statement yesterday.  “We are determined to do what it takes to get to the
bottom of this and clean up what I call earlier mismanagement,”
Carrefour Chief Executive Officer  Lars Olofsson  said Nov. 30 on
a conference call. The situation in Brazil, which was discovered
by Carrefour’s internal teams, is “flabbergasting” and “a
malfunction that evidently we cannot accept,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
