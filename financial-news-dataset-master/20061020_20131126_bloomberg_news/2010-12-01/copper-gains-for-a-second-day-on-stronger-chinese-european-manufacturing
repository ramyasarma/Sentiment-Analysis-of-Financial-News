Copper prices had the biggest gain in
almost four weeks as factory output expanded in China, the
world’s biggest consumer. Aluminum jumped the most in seven
weeks.  Chinese manufacturing grew at a faster pace than forecast,
government data showed today. The country’s infrastructure
spending will create sustained demand, said Zhou Zhongshu, the
president of China Minmetals Corp., the nation’s biggest metal
trader. In November, the price climbed 2.5 percent, the fifth
straight monthly advance.  “Prices are up on the heels of upbeat Chinese
manufacturing data, which in theory leads to more copper
consumption.” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Copper futures for March delivery climbed 12.2 cents, or
3.2 percent, to settle at $3.9475 a pound at 1:44 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the biggest gain since Nov. 4. Earlier, the
price reached $3.9505, the highest since Nov. 15.  The metal has jumped 37 percent since July 1, reaching a
30-month high of $4.0875 a pound on Nov. 11, as global
inventories declined.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $225, or 2.7 percent, to $8,8585 a metric ton
($3.89 a pound). The commodity reached a record $8,966 on Nov.
11.  Prices have also rallied on concern that a strike at the
world’s fourth-largest mine will curb supply.  Workers at Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc’s Collahuasi
copper mine in Chile have been off the job for 27 days.  Aluminum rose $65, or 2.9 percent, to $2,340 a ton in
London, the biggest gain since Oct. 8.  Zinc, tin, nickel and lead also gained on the LME.  To contact the reporters on this story:
