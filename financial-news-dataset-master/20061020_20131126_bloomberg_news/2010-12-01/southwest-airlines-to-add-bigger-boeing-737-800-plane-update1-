Southwest Airlines Co. , the world’s
biggest low-fare carrier, will add a larger model of  Boeing
Co. ’s 737 to its fleet to carry more passengers on high-demand
routes and boost fuel efficiency.  The airline’s decision to switch some existing orders for
737-700s to 737-800s followed the approval today by pilots of
contract changes letting them fly the bigger jet, the Dallas-
based carrier said in a statement. Flight attendants last month
approved similar contract revisions.  The larger  plane  will let Southwest increase seating
capacity even as it holds its fleet of 737s steady, taking new
aircraft only as replacements for older ones. The carrier will
also be able to pack more passengers on high-demand routes and
fly to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.  “The 737-800 is the sweet spot of Boeing’s narrow-body
family,” said  Douglas Runte , a managing director with Piper
Jaffray & Co. in New York. “If you can fill up the plane, it is
far more efficient for an airline to operate than the smaller
737-700.”  The -800 has 175 seats, 28 percent more than the -700, is
about 10 percent more fuel efficient per seat and should trim
costs to fly each seat a mile by about 15 percent. Southwest is
the  largest operator  of Boeing 737s, the only type of aircraft
it flies.  Pilot Contracts  The carrier will complete talks with Boeing on changing an
unspecified number of -700 orders, equipment options for the
larger planes and seating configuration. The airline expects to
take delivery of the first -800 in the first quarter of 2012.  “It is normal for customers to switch aircraft models,”
said  Vicki Ray , a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing.  Southwest said July 29 that it had exercised options to buy
25 737-700s valued at $1.7 billion, based on list prices, with
deliveries to start in 2011.  More than 75 percent of pilots voting approved changes to
include the -800 in their contract, the Southwest Airlines
Pilots’ Association said today. The revisions also provide for a
September 2011 pay increase of either 2 percent, or an amount
linked to Southwest’s profitability, whichever is greater; and a
profitability-based raise in September 2012, as well as a one-
year extension of the agreement to 2012.  Changes approved earlier by the  Transport Workers Union 
provide for one additional flight attendant on the -800s and a
contract extension, a profitability-based raise and company-paid
training.  Southwest will divert from its long-held strategy of flying
only 737s, the world’s most widely flown jetliner, when it
acquires AirTran Holdings Inc. and adds that carrier’s Boeing
717s. Southwest agreed in September to buy AirTran for $1.4
billion in cash and stock.  Southwest  rose  10 cents to $13.42 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 17
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
