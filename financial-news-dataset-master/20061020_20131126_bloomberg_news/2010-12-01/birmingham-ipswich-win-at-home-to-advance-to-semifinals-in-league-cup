Birmingham and Ipswich won home games
to advance to the semifinals of English soccer’s League Cup.  Birmingham beat Aston Villa, last season’s runner up, 2-1,
while Ipswich of the second-division Championship beat West
Bromwich Albion 1-0. The two join Arsenal and West Ham in the
final four of England’s second-tier club competition.  Nikola Zigic ’s goal in the 85th minute gave Birmingham the
win over local rival Villa.  Birmingham took a 1-0 lead on  Sebastian Larsson ’s 12th-
minute penalty kick after  Lee Bowyer  was taken down by  Richard Dunne . Villa tied the game in the 30th minute on a goal from
 Gabriel Agbonlahor .  Zigic got the winner with five minutes remaining with a
shot that deflected off a defender over lunging Villa goalkeeper
 Brad Friedel .  Ipswich, which is 16th in the Championship, is the lone
team from outside the top flight left in the competition
following its win over West Brom.  Grant Leadbitter scored the only goal with a penalty kick
in the 69th minute after Graham Dorrans brought down Carlos
Edwards.  Birmingham will next face West Ham, which last night beat
defending champion Manchester United 4-0. Ipswich will face
Arsenal, which beat Wigan 2-0. The two-match semifinals will be
played the weeks of Jan. 10 and 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
