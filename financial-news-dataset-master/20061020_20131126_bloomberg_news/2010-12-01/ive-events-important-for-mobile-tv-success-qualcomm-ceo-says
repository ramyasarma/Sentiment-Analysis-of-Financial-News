Broadcasting live events is crucial
to the success of TV on mobile phones and tablet computers,
Qualcomm Inc. Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs said at a
technology industry event in Silicon Valley late today.  “I believe in mobile TV still. Our approach to it didn’t
get enough subscribers,” said Jacobs, speaking at the event in
San Jose, California, hosted by the Churchill Club. Qualcomm
garnered nearly 1 million subscribers for its Flo TV mobile-
television service, he said.  The San Diego-based company suspended sales of Flo TV after
it struggled to attract more subscribers. Jacobs said in an
interview with Bloomberg Nov. 16 that he was considering a range
of options for the Flo TV business, including putting it in a
joint venture or shutting it and selling the spectrum.   Live sports and other events may be vital for TV 
services on phones and tablets, and vendors should allocate
sufficient bandwidth to those broadcasts, Jacobs said today.  Requiring consumers to tune in to watch a show
at a specific time was a “total non-starter” for Flo TV,
Jacobs said. He appeared on stage with Jon Rubinstein, the
Hewlett-Packard Co. executive responsible for the company’s Palm
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
