World food prices climbed for a fifth
month, rising to the highest level in more than two years in
November on higher costs for cereals, sugar and cooking oil, the
United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization said.  The FAO’s  index of 55 food commodities  jumped to 205.4
points, the highest level since July 2008, the Rome-based agency
said in a monthly  report  on its website today. The indicator
rose from 198.1 points in October.  Food prices may rise further unless global grain production
rises “significantly” next year, the FAO said in a Nov. 17
report. The cost of food rose to a record in June 2008,
prompting deadly riots in countries from Haiti to Egypt.  The advance is the longest since January, when the price
index rose for six months before declining in February. Prices
climbed for an uninterrupted 18 months through March 2008,
falling the next month before rising to a record.  The cereal-price index jumped to 224.9 points from 219.9,
while the indicator for cooking-oil prices rose to 243.3 points
in November from 220 points in the previous month. The gauge for
sugar prices advanced to 374.7 points from 349.3.  The index for dairy prices rose to 207.8 from 202.6 points
and the meat-price index was unchanged at 138.5 points, the FAO
data showed.  The basis for the FAO index is 2002-04. The gauge includes
commodity quotations that the agency considers representative
for international food prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
