China will become the world’s biggest
computer market within three years, overtaking the U.S.,  Acer
Inc.  Chief Executive Officer  Gianfranco Lanci  said.  “We see China as huge potential,” Lanci said at a press
conference in the western city of Chongqing. Acer, the world’s
second-largest computer maker behind  Hewlett-Packard Co ., is
aiming for the No. 2 slot in the Chinese market, he said today.  Computer sales in China, the world’s fastest-growing major
economy, may rise 21 percent this year from last year’s 54
million units, according to IDC. That is faster than the 14
percent gain in global shipments, the research company said.  Acer overtaking the Chinese market leader  Lenovo Group Ltd. 
in its home seems “impossible,” Lanci said. The Taipei-based
company is currently ranked sixth in China with a third-quarter
market share of 4.3 percent, while Lenovo had 28.8 percent,
according to IDC.  “We never said we want to be number one in China,” Lanci
said. “We want to become number two in China, and we are almost
number two. That is much more achievable.”  Globally, Acer aims to displace HP from the top spot, he
said, reiterating a target the company set previously.  Lanci was in Chongqing to sign agreements with the
municipal government related to a $150 million investment in a
distribution center in the city that was announced last month.  -- Edmond Lococo . Editors:  Vipin V. Nair ,  Garry Smith   To contact the reporter on this story:
