Ghana , the West African nation set to
begin exporting oil this month, will see reserves reach 5
billion barrels in five years as more fields start production,
according to the chairman of the parliament’s energy committee.  The country may also start exploring for crude onshore,
Moses Asaga, a member of President  John Atta Mills’  ruling
National Democratic Congress party, told lawmakers in Accra, the
capital, today.  State-owned Ghana National Petroleum Corp. and the
government are “expecting to do technical exploration in the
Volatain basin so that in the next five to 10 years we can start
doing oil production on shore,” Asaga said. The region stretches
from the south along the Volta River to the north of the
country, along its border with neighboring Togo, according to
the GNPC’s website.  Production at the country’s offshore Jubilee field,
discovered in 2007, in due to begin Dec. 15, field operator
Tullow Oil Plc said Nov. 29. Tullow has also announced finds at
the Tweneboa and Owo wells, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles)
west of Jubilee. Other foreign companies with licenses in the
nation’s offshore territory include  OAO Lukoil , Nigeria’s Oranto
Petroleum Ltd., and U.S.-based  Hess Corp. , and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
