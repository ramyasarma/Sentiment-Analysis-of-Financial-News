The rand strengthened after faster-
than-expected manufacturing growth in China boosted the outlook
for the global economy, encouraging purchases of higher-yielding
assets. South Africa’s purchasing managers’ index also rose.  The currency appreciated as much as 1.1 percent to 7.0110
per dollar and traded at 7.0476 by 4:19 p.m. in Johannesburg,
from a previous close of 7.09. Against the euro, the rand
advanced 0.1 percent to 9.2386 for a third day of gains.  China’s  Purchasing Managers’ Index  grew at a faster pace
for a fourth straight month in November, climbing to 55.2 from
54.7 in October, according to a logistics federation report.
That was more than the 54.8 median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey and followed a report yesterday by the U.S. Conference
Board that showed sentiment amongst consumers in the world’s
biggest economy rose to a five-month high in November.  “U.S. consumer confidence yesterday was the latest in a
string of statistics that suggest that the world’s largest
economy is picking up while China’s PMI data this morning shows
that the world’s second-largest economy is continuing to expand
at a breakneck pace,”  John Cairns , head of foreign-exchange
research at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, wrote in a
client note today.  South Africa’s  purchasing managers’ index  climbed above 50
in November, indicating an expansion in manufacturing output and
a strengthening in the economy’s recovery,  Kagiso Securities
Ltd.  said. The seasonally adjusted index rose to 52.9 from 49.8
in October, Johannesburg-based Kagiso said in an e-mailed
statement today. The index had been below 50, indicating a
contraction in factory output, for the past two months.  Government bonds rose for a second day in South Africa,
with the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015
adding 30 cents to 124.35 rand. The yield on the security
declined 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.36
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
