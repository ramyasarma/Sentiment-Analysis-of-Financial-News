Nevada ’s outlook was lowered to
negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service, citing a $3
billion budget gap and an unexpected decline in the gaming
industry, “a sector that was previously believed to be
recession proof.”  The state that’s home to Las Vegas, the biggest U.S.
gambling center, retained its rating of Aa1, second-highest,
Moody’s said in a report today.  The negative outlook reflects “a very large expected
budget gap for the next biennium; uncertainty around how the
state will solve the gap, given the fact that the state has
drawn down almost all of its reserves already; a very weak
economy, and uncertainty around the recovery of gaming in the
state,” Moody’s analysts  Emily Raimes  and  Julius Vizner  said in
the report.  Nevada’s gaming industry, the state’s economic engine, has
show signs of stabilizing, according to the report. Las Vegas
Strip casino gambling rose 2.8 percent in September to $520.6
million, the Nevada Gaming Control Board said Nov. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
