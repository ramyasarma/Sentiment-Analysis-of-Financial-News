Brazilian President-elect  Dilma Rousseff  plans to name  Paulo Bernardo  as communications minister
and  Sergio Cortes  as health minister, a government official
familiar with the matter said.  Bernardo, 58, is currently planning minister and said last
week he was offered a ministerial position in Rousseff’s
government. Cortes, 44, a doctor, is health secretary for the
state of Rio de Janeiro. The official asked to remain anonymous
as the appointments have not yet been made public.  Rousseff said last week she will announce all cabinet
appointments by Dec. 17. Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  will
remain in his post,  Alexandre Tombini  will replace  Henrique Meirelles  as central bank president and  Miriam Belchior  was
named as planning minister.  The presidential palace staff will include former Finance
Minister  Antonio Palocci  as chief of staff and  Gilberto Carvalho 
as secretary general of the presidency, an official familiar
with the matter said last week, requesting anonymity as the
selections aren’t yet public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
