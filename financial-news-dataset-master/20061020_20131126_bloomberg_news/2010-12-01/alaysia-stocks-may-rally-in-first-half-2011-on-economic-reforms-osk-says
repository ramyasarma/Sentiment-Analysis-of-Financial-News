Malaysia’s  stock index  may rally in
the first half of 2011 as economic reforms accelerate, according
to OSK Research Sdn., a unit of the nation’s biggest retail
brokerage.  The benchmark  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI index  may rise to
1,648 by the end of June, said  Chris Eng , an analyst at the unit
of OSK Investment Bank Bhd. The gauge, which has risen 16
percent this year, fell 0.2 percent to 1,482.26 as of 2:30 p.m.  The  index  reached an intraday  record  of 1,531.99 on Nov. 10
as international investors purchased more of the nation’s stocks
than at any time since at least 1995, according to data compiled
by EPFR Global. Shares may extend gains on the government’s
economic reforms, rising foreign fund flows to Malaysia and Asia
and a possible early general election.  “All the conditions are right for a rally early next year,
go for big,” he said in an interview. He recommended investors
become “buyers for December ahead of 2011.”  Investors should buy big companies such as  CIMB Group
Holdings Bhd.  and Malayan Banking Bhd., phone company Axiata
Group Bhd. and property developer SP Setia Bhd., Eng said.  On Nov. 1, Eng predicted the nation’s equities will fall in
November on “profit taking.” The index sank 1.4 percent,
halting five monthly gains, the longest stretch in more than
three years, as monetary tightening in China and Europe’s debt
crisis threatened to stall a global recovery.  “We were correct,” said Eng in a strategy report today.
“For December, we would advise investors to return to the
market to position for a potential rally in the first half of
2011.”  Historically, December has been a “good” month since 1996,
posting positive returns 86 percent of the time, he said.  Malaysian Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said in his Oct. 14
budget speech that the government plans a 100-floor tower and a
mass rail project to boost spending and spur growth.  Stocks may also rally as the government may hold general
elections early next year to capitalize on its strengthening
political fortunes, he said. Polls must be held by 2013.  OSK Investment is part of OSK Holdings Bhd., a Kuala
Lumpur-based investment banking, broking and asset management
group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
