General Motors Co. ’s GM Daewoo Auto &
Technology Co. unit said it will fully repay a $1 billion
revolving credit facility led by Korea Development Bank this
month, reducing the company’s borrowing costs.  GM Daewoo also said it will continue talks with Korea
Development Bank, its main creditor, relating to technology
agreements and an equity rights issue.  “We are in the middle of discussing these issues with KDB
and our talks are progressing positively,”  Jay Cooney , a
spokesman for Incheon, South Korea-based GM Daewoo, said in an
e-mailed response to questions today. Cooney said he couldn’t
provide more details on the rights issue and technology pacts.  The full repayment reflects GM Daewoo’s strong financial
performance this year, the unit’s Chief Executive Officer  Mike Arcamone  said in a statement. Korea Development Bank has
extended the credit facility seven times since May, Cooney said.  GM Daewoo sold 680,305 vehicles in the first 11 months of
2010, 33 percent more than a year earlier, according to a
separate company statement. The units sold included exports of
568,888.  To contact the reporter on this story:
