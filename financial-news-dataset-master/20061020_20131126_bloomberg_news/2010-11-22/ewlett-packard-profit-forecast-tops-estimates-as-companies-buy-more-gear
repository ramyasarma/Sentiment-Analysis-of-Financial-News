Hewlett-Packard Co. , the world’s
largest computer maker, forecast first-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates as corporations step up buying of
personal computers, printers, servers and networking gear.  Excluding some costs,  profit  will be at least $1.28 a share
in the quarter ending in January, Palo Alto, California-based HP
said today in a statement.  Sales  will be $32.8 billion to $33
billion. Analysts had  estimated  $1.22 in earnings and $32.8
billion in revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, led by new Chief Executive Officer  Leo Apotheker , is benefiting from business customers replacing aging
PCs and servers. HP is boosting research and development efforts
to make its products and services more compelling and better use
HP inventions across consumer and business products, Apotheker
said today on a conference call with analysts.  “It’s not simply about spending more on R&D,” said
Apotheker, who became CEO on Nov. 1. “Just as we help customers
knock down their technology silos, we have the opportunity to
knock down a few of our own.”  HP rose 3.2 percent to $44.62 in  late trading  after gaining
76 cents to $43.25 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. HP
has lost about 7 percent since former CEO  Mark Hurd  resigned on
Aug. 6.  Research and development costs rose 16 percent to $814
million in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, outpacing
 revenue growth .  “We expect this trend to continue,” Apotheker said.  Fourth Quarter  Fourth-quarter net income rose 5.2 percent to $2.54
billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.41 billion, or 99 cents, a
year earlier. Excluding some costs,  earnings  climbed to $1.33 a
share in the period, which ended Oct. 31.  Sales rose 8.1 percent to $33.3 billion. Analysts had
projected earnings of $1.27 a share and revenue of $32.8
billion. HP has topped analysts’ predictions in 22 of the past
23 quarters.  Revenue  in the PC group rose 4.3 percent to $10.3 billion,
while sales in the business storage and server business climbed
25 percent to $5.27 billion. Revenue from printers and printing
supplies increased 8.4 percent to $7 billion.  “They clearly beat on the top and the bottom line,” said
 Shannon Cross , an analyst at Cross Research in Livingston, New
Jersey. She recommends buying HP shares and doesn’t own any
herself. “The strength in their numbers right now is what
they’re seeing in the commercial segment” and growth in the
networking business, she said.  Full Year  HP expects fiscal 2011 revenue of $132 billion to $133.5
billion. Excluding some  acquisition  costs and other expenses,
earnings will be $5.16 to $5.26 a share. Analyst predicted
$132.3 billion in revenue and $5.09 in earnings.  Apotheker also said today that the company will reinstitute
salary raises in the coming fiscal year.  Global PC shipments rose 11 percent in the third quarter, a
slowdown from 22 percent in the second quarter, according to IDC
in Framingham, Massachusetts. HP is the No. 1 global PC
supplier, ahead of Acer Inc. and Dell Inc.  HP named Apotheker to replace Hurd, who resigned after a
company investigation found he had an improper personal
relationship with an HP contractor. Hurd now serves as co-
president at  Oracle Corp.   Apotheker was ousted from German software maker SAP AG in
February after less than nine months as CEO. Last month, he told
analysts he would use software to make HP’s other computing
 products  more attractive to customers and try to boost growth in
emerging markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
