Gourmet Master Co. , operator of
Taiwan’s largest coffee-shop chain, surged 138 percent on its
first day of trading in Taipei after raising funds in an initial
public offering to finance an expansion in China.  Gourmet Master , which operates stores under the 85C brand
in Taiwan, China, Australia and the U.S., rose to NT$400 at the
close of 1:30 p.m. from its IPO price of NT$168 a share. The
company sold 14.25 million new shares to the public and
employees, raising NT$2.39 billion ($79 million), Michelle
Hsieh, a spokeswoman for the company, said by phone today.  “Investors are pinning hopes on the company’s expansion in
the China market,”  Tu Jin-lung , chairman of Grand Cathay
Investment Services Corp., said in a phone interview today. "
"People believe in these China leads and they are eager to jump
on the bandwagon."  The restaurant operator will use the proceeds of its IPO to
increase its Chinese outlets more than sixfold to 1,000,
challenging  Starbucks Corp.  in the fastest-growing major
economy, Chairman  Wu Cheng-Hsueh  said on Nov. 8. Coffee-chain
operators are expanding in China, which Starbucks predicts will
be its biggest growth market in two years.  Gourmet Master will open stores in cities including
Shenzhen, Chengdu and Wuhan in China, aiming to reach its
expansion target by 2015, Wu said.  Taiwan IPOs  Its initial share sale is the second-largest on the local
bourse so far this year, second only to the NT$6.2 billion
raised by  TPK Holding Co.  last month. TPK also more than doubled
on its first day of trading in Taipei and rose 3.9 percent to
NT$566 today, compared with its IPO price of NT$220.  “The enthusiastic response the new stocks received from
the Taiwan market would lure more foreign companies to trade on
the local bourse going forward,” Sam Lee, Investment and
Corporate Bank chief at  Yuanta Securities Co. , said in a phone
interview today. Yuanta was underwriter for both Gourmet Master
and TPK.  Jih Sun Securities Investment Consulting Co. set an
estimated price forecast for Gourmet Master of NT$240 on its
China expansion plans and estimated earnings of NT$8.97 per
share in 2011.  Gourmet Master’s IPO price of NT$168 gave it an estimated
price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7, using Jih Sun’s estimates. That
compares with a current price-to-earnings ratio of 39 for
 Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd.  and 38 for  Ajisen China Holdings
Ltd. , which operates fast-food restaurants in Hong Kong and
mainland China.  Cheaper Than Starbucks  Gourmet Master has 325 stores in Taiwan, of which 41 are
wholly owned, compared with 231 directly owned outlets for
closely held President Starbucks Coffee Corp., a joint venture
established in 1998 between the world’s biggest coffee-shop
chain and  Uni-President Enterprises Corp . and President Chain
Store Corp. President Starbucks has said it aims to have 235
stores in Taiwan by the end of the year.  Gourmet Master’s 85C outlets sell a 16-ounce serving of
latte for NT$65 ($2.15) compared with NT$110 at Starbucks.
Gourmet Master offers American coffee for NT$50 for a 16-ounce
serving compared with Starbucks’ NT$95 Caffe Americano.  President Chain Store Corp.  sells latte for NT$50 at the
more than 4,700 7-Eleven stores it operates in Taiwan. Its stock
fell 0.4 percent to NT$124.50.  Uni-President Enterprises closed unchanged at NT$41.00
today. The benchmark Taiex Index rose 0.8 percent to 8,374.91.
Taiwan allows share prices to rise or fall by a maximum 7
percent per day. Stocks are exempt from the rule for their first
five trading sessions.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
