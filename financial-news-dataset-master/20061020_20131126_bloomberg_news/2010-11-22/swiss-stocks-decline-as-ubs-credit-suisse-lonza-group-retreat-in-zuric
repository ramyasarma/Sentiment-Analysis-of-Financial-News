Stocks in Switzerland fell, trimming
last week’s rally for the Swiss Market Index, as Ireland’s
request for a bailout failed to ease concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will spread further.  The benchmark SMI fell 0.3 percent to 6,571.1 at 12:59 p.m.
in Zurich after earlier climbing as much as 0.5 percent. UBS AG
and Credit Suisse Group AG, the nation’s largest banks, fell 1.6
percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. Lonza Group AG led
declines on the SMI, losing 2.8 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
