Comet Properties Ltd., a  Ghanaian

million) in an initial public offering set to begin Dec. 28,

Exchange likely by early March, said Rexford Adomako-Bonsu,
Worldwide’s chairman, in a phone interview today. Comet will be
the first real-estate company listed on the Ghanaian bourse.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
