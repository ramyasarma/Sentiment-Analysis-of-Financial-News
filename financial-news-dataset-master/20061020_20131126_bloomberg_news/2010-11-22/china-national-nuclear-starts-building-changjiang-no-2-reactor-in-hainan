China National Nuclear Corp. , the
country’s biggest operator of nuclear power plants, started
construction of a 650-megawatt reactor in the southern island
province of Hainan.  The No. 2 reactor, one of two to be built in the first
phase, will start commercial operations in 2015, China National
Nuclear said in a  statement  on its website today. Investment in
the initial phase of the Changjiang plant will exceed 20 billion
yuan ($3 billion), the Beijing-based company said.  China wants at least 15 percent of its energy mix to come
from non-fossil fuel by 2020 and is accelerating construction of
nuclear plants to help meet that goal. The Hainan facility will
join 23 other reactors being built in China, the nation with the
biggest nuclear-power capacity under construction, according to
the official Xinhua News Agency in May.  Work on the No. 1 reactor at Changjiang started on April 25
and operation at the facility will begin end-2014, China
National Nuclear said in today’s statement. The reactor will
also have a capacity of 650 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
