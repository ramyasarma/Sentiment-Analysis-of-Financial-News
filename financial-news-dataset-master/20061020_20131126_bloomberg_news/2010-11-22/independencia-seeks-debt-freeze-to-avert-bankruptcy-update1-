Independencia SA, the Brazilian
meatpacker whose creditors include Citigroup Inc., is seeking to
suspend debt payments for 60 days and convert $800 million of
liabilities into stock of a new company to avert bankruptcy.  Investors seeking to restructure the company are asking for
a so-called standstill agreement with bondholders, suppliers and
other creditors while they conduct due diligence, representative
Alfredo Chang said at a meeting with creditors in Sao Paulo
today, without disclosing the investors. Failure to reach an
accord may lead to bankruptcy, Independencia lawyer Luiz
Fernando Paiva said at the same meeting.  “Independencia’s bankruptcy will be almost inevitable in
case creditors don’t approve the recovery plan we are presenting
today,” Paiva said.  Independencia, which filed for bankruptcy protection in
February 2009 and halted production last month, had debt of 1.5
billion reais ($872 million) and cash of 5.4 million reais as of
June 30. On Sept. 30, it missed an interest payment on its 2015
senior notes. The company was due to pay interest of about $12
million on $165 million of the 15 percent bonds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Independencia owes Citigroup 24.9 million reais, according
to documents provided by a bankruptcy court.  JPMorgan Chase &
Co . is owed about 138 million reais, the documents show.  The Brazilian meatpacker owns 14 slaughter plants and three
warehouses, according to a presentation on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
