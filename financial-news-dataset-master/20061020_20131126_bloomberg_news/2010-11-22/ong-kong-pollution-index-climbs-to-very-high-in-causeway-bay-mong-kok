Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at the Causeway Bay and Mong Kok roadside
monitoring stations as of 10 a.m. today, the city’s
Environmental Protection Department said on its website.  Pollution was 115 in Causeway Bay and 102 in Mong Kok, the
department said.  Roadside readings above 100 trigger a government warning
for people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid
prolonged stays in heavy traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
