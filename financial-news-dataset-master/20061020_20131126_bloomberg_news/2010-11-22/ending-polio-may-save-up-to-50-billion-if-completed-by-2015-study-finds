A global  polio -eradication program,
the world’s largest international public health project, could
save as much as $50 billion over the next few decades if the
crippling disease is wiped out within five years, a study found.  The research, published in the November edition of the
medical journal  Vaccine , estimates the net benefits of the
program from 1988 to 2035 to be about $40 billion to $50
billion, most of which will be generated in poor countries.  The  Global Polio Eradication Initiative  will prevent about
8 million cases of potentially deadly paralytic polio, while
assisting the distribution of life-saving vitamin A, the study’s
authors said. A $2.6 billion plan to root out the last vestiges
of the disease by 2013 faces an $810 million funding gap.  “This study finds a strong economic justification for the
GPEI despite the rising costs of the initiative,” they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
