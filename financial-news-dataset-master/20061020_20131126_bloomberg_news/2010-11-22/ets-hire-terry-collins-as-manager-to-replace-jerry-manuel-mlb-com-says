Terry Collins  was hired as manager
of the New York Mets, who missed the Major League Baseball
playoffs the past four seasons,  MLB.com reported .  Collins, 61, a former manager of the Houston Astros and
Anaheim Angels, will probably be introduced as  Jerry Manuel ’s
successor in a press conference tomorrow, MLB.com said without
saying where it obtained the information.  Mets spokesman  Jay Horwitz  said in an e-mail that the team
had made a decision and is in the process of negotiating a
contract. He declined to comment on whether the negotiations
were with Collins or another of the Mets’ other finalists --
 Wally Backman ,  Chip Hale  and  Bob Melvin .  Collins, the Mets’ minor league field coordinator in 2010,
has a major-league managerial record of 444-434 and had success
leading rebuilding phases even though his teams never reached
the playoffs.  Collins took Houston to three straight second-place
finishes in the National League Central from 1994 to 1996. He
was fired after the 1996 season with one year remaining on his
contract and was hired by the Angels after Anaheim lost 91 games
the previous season.  Under Collins, the Angels finished second in the American
League West in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, after starting the season
51-82 and losing the support of a number of his veteran players,
Collins was fired with 29 games remaining.  Collins managed in Japan in 2007 and 2008, and coached
China in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.  The Mets finished below .500 each of the last two seasons
and haven’t made the World Series since losing in five games to
the New York Yankees in 2000.  With the league’s fifth-highest payroll, the Mets finished
79-83 last season and were 18 games behind the Philadelphia
Phillies in the NL East. The Mets fired Manuel and General
Manager  Omar Minaya  on Oct. 4 and hired  Sandy Alderson  as
Minaya’s successor on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
