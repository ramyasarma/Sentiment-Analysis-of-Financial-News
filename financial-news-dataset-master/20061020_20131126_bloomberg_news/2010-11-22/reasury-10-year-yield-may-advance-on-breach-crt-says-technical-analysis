The Treasury 10-year note yield is
poised to move higher if it breaks 2.97 percent, according to
CRT Capital Group LLC, citing technical analysis.  A breach of that level would mean the yield stands a “good
potential” to touch 3.17 percent,  David Ader  and  Ian Lyngen ,
CRT government bond strategists in Stamford, Connecticut, wrote
in a note to clients. The 3.17 percent mark is a 50 percent
retracement of the  drop  from the 2010 high of 4.01 percent
reached in April.  The level of “2.97 percent is a very important technical
level as opposed to a trend,” Ader said. “It’s an area where
people have done some buying. It’s a clearing price for the
market, and it has held us.” Resistance lies at 2.76 percent to
2.79 percent, while support is at 2.97 percent, said CRT.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note minus the year-over
year consumer price index, known as the real yield, was 1.63
percent today, down from a 2010 high of 2.07 percent in July.  “We’d be a hands-down buyer,” the strategists wrote.
“The spread there to current year-over-year CPI would be about
2 percent versus the mean over the last 10 years of 1.81
percent.”  The  yield  on the 10-year note reached 2.96 percent on Nov.
16, the highest level since Aug. 5, before closing the week at
2.87 percent. The yield touched an intraday high today of 2.90
percent and a low of 2.80 percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is a level where sell
orders may be clustered, while support is where orders to buy
may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
