Sugar rebounded on signs of lower
production in India, the world’s second-biggest grower. Coffee
and cocoa declined.  Output in Maharashtra, India’s biggest state producer of
refined sugar, dropped 29 percent from Oct. 1 to Nov. 20 from a
year earlier as heavy rains slowed the harvest, an industry
group said. The price of raw sugar has more than doubled since
touching a 13-month low on May 7 as adverse weather threatened
global crops. Brazil is the top grower.  “The fundamentals support higher prices,”  said  Bruno Zaneti , a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group in
Campinas, Brazil.  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.35 cent, or 1.3
percent, to settle at 26.5 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. In the previous two weeks, the price
tumbled 18 percent.  Output in India may total 24.5 million metric tons in the
year that started Oct. 1, K.V. Thomas, a junior agriculture
minister, said on Nov. 19. That compares with a government
forecast earlier this month of 25 million tons.  “There seems to be a little bit of a trend for talking
down the Indian crop,” said  Jake Wetherall , a trader at
Rabobank International in London.  Futures had slumped in the previous two weeks after China
took steps to cool its economy, spurring speculation that demand
for raw materials will drop.  In London, refined-sugar futures for March delivery fell
$5.40, or 0.8 percent, to $673.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery dropped 4.1
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.0715 a pound in New York. In
London, robusta-coffee futures for January delivery declined
$62, or 3.2 percent, to $1,848 a ton.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell $29, or 1 percent, to
$2,839 a ton in New York. In London, cocoa futures for March
delivery fell 10 pounds, or 0.5 percent, to 1,869 pounds
($2,980) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
