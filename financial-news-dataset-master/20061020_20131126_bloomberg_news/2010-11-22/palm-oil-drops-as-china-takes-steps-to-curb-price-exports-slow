Palm oil plunged the most in more
than 15 months on concern that China’s plans to cool domestic
prices by selling cooking-oil stockpiles will reduce demand from
the world’s biggest user of the commodity.  The contract for delivery in February fell 4.3 percent to
3,184 ringgit ($1,026) a metric ton at close on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange in Kuala Lumpur, the most since Aug. 17,
2009. September-delivery futures on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 3.3 percent to 8,538 yuan ($1,286) a
ton, before closing at 8,558 yuan.  China’s government will increase packaged grain and cooking
oil stockpiles for timely release onto the market,  Nie Zhenbang ,
director of the State Administration of Grain, said on Nov. 19.
The country will also sell soybeans and vegetable oil from its
stockpiles starting this week to cool prices, the agency said in
a separate statement that day.  “China’s measures to control inflation are impacting not
just the palm oil market but all commodity markets,” said  Ben Santoso , analyst at DBS Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte. in
Singapore. “It’s going to be a wait-and-see strategy as price-
control operations lasted about two months in 2008.”  The People’s Bank of China on Nov. 19 ordered a 50 basis
point increase in the amount of money that lenders must keep
aside to cool the fastest rise in consumer prices in two years.  “Any release of stockpiles will eventually have to be
restocked because of demand prospects, hence driving up prices
again,”  Bernard Ching , an analyst at ECM Libra Capital Sdn.,
said in a report today. “At the current juncture where supplies
of soybeans and crude palm oil are vulnerable, it would be all
the more difficult to keep prices suppressed.”  Exports Slow  Palm-oil exports from Malaysia, the second-biggest producer,
rose 12 percent to 1.05 million tons in the first 20 days of the
month compared with the same period in October, Intertek said.
Shipments slowed from a 26.6 percent gain in the first 15 days
of the month, data from the surveyor show. Exports gained 18.3
percent to 1.1 million tons, rival Societe Generale de
Surveillance said.  “Exports will slow as Diwali demand is over and Chinese
New Year is sometime away,” said Santoso. “Palm oil may pause
for a while from the recent run-up or correct a bit.”  Palm oil fell 0.8 percent last week, snapping an 11-week
rally that drove prices to more than a two-year high.  Edible-oils demand from China normally increases in the
months before the Lunar New Year holiday in February.  Heavy Rainfall  Malaysia has no plans to change its 2010 palm-oil output
forecast even as the La Nina weather event may impact harvest,
Industries and Commodities Minister  Bernard Dompok  said in Kuala
Lumpur today. Production may total 17.8 million tons, according
to a government report on Oct. 15.  Rainfall in Malaysia may be as 40 percent above normal in
November and December, the state forecaster said in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg News. Rain over the northern and eastern
coast states of Peninsular and Sabah will be slightly above the
long term average, it said.  January-delivery soybean oil jumped as much as 1.7 percent
to 50.14 cents a pound in Chicago and traded at 49.36 cents at
6:10 p.m. in Singapore, while soybeans for delivery in the same
month rose as much as 1.7 percent to $12.22 a bushel and was at
$12.11 a bushel at 6:11 p.m. in Singapore.  Soybean oil September delivery in Dalian slumped as much as
3 percent to 9,230 yuan a ton and ended at 9,254 yuan. CME Group
Inc.’s March palm oil contract, pegged to the Malaysian
benchmark price, climbed as much as 2.3 percent to $1,055 a ton.  -- With assistance from  Ranjeetha Pakiam  in Kuala Lumpur.
