Moody’s Corp. , the New York-based
ratings firm, bought CSI Global Education Inc. from Onex Corp.
for C$155 million ($151.4 million) in cash to expand its
financial education offerings.  The acquisition will have a negligible impact on fourth-
quarter and 2011 results, and will add to earnings after that,
Moody’s said today in a statement.  CSI has provided financial education and credentials for
more than 40 years, and offers more than 170 training courses
for securities, commercial banking, wealth management and
insurance, including the Canadian Securities Course. Toronto-
based CSI will continue operating under the CSI Global Education
name as a separate unit within the Moody’s analytics business,
Moody’s said.  CSI was bought by the private-equity unit of Toronto-based
Onex, Canada’s largest buyout firm, in January 2006. Terms
weren’t disclosed. Onex confirmed the sale in a separate
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
