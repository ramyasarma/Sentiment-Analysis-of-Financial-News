Boeing Co. , the world’s largest
aerospace company, plans to deliver its first commercial scale
high-efficiency solar-power cells for Earth-based electricity
production in January.  The concentrating photovoltaic cells, developed by Boeing’s
Spectrolab unit for satellites and the International Space
Station, can convert as much as 39.2 percent of sunlight into
electricity, Chicago-based Boeing said today in a statement.  Spectrolab, which says its solar panels supply power for
60 percent of the satellites orbiting Earth, plans to boost
output of the higher-efficiency cells for land-based production.
Efficiency may average 40 percent next year as improvements are
made during production, Boeing said.  The cells are made from single-crystal germanium
substrates, said Russ Jones, a Spectrolab business development
director. The company will produce as many as 10 million of the
cells next year, depending on demand. He would not discuss
production costs.  The top polysilicon-based solar panels manufactured by
 SunPower Corp ., based in San Jose, California, can convert a
maximum of 22 percent of the sun’s rays into electricity. In
June, a SunPower solar cell reached a 24.2 percent conversion
efficiency, the record for large silicon wafers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
