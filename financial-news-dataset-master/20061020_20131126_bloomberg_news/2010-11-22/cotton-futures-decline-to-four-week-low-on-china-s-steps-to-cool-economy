Cotton declined to a four-week low
as China, the world’s biggest consumer, took steps to curb
speculative trading and cool the economy, eroding demand from
textile producers.  Last week, China increased bank-reserve requirements
following the fastest rise in consumer prices in two years, and
Premier  Wen Jiabao  held a Cabinet meeting to call for a
crackdown on speculation in agricultural goods, saying price
controls may be needed on “daily necessities.” Cotton dropped
13 percent in the previous two weeks.  “When the market’s falling like this, the mills don’t want
to jump in and catch the falling knife,” said  Andy Ryan , a
senior risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers & Textiles
in Nashville, Tennessee. In China, “mills have gotten very
confused and nervous,” he said.  Cotton for March delivery fell 5.36 cents, or 4.4 percent,
to settle at $1.1779 a pound at 2:45 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Earlier, the price tumbled by the exchange limit of 6
cents to $1.1715, the lowest since Oct. 22.  Cotton has gained 56 percent this year, reaching a record
$1.5195 on Nov. 10, amid surging demand from China and plunging
 inventories  in the U.S., the leading exporter.  “The market got way ahead of itself, way ahead of the
fundamentals,” said  Keith Brown , the president of Keith Brown &
Co., a brokerage in Moultrie, Georgia.  Cash prices in Beijing  dropped to 28,520 yuan a metric ton
today, down 9.5 percent from 31,526 yuan on Nov. 11, the highest
since at least 2003, according to data from Shanghai JC
Intelligence Co.  Regional authorities in China must report before Nov. 30 on
their progress in stabilizing prices of essential goods
including food, the State Council said on Nov. 20.  China’s new-crop harvest was 68 percent completed at the
end of October, the China Cotton Association said today, citing
a National Development and Reform Commission report. A year
earlier, 82 percent was gathered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
