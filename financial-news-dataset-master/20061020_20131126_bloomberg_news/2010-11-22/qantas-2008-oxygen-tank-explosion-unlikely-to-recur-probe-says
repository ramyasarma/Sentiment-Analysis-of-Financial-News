An oxygen-tank explosion that forced
a  Qantas Airways Ltd.  plane to make an emergency landing in
Manila two years ago was a “very rare event” that is unlikely
to happen again, according to Australian investigators.  “Given the widespread and long-term use of this type of
cylinder in aerospace applications, it was clear that this
occurrence was a very rare event,” the Australian  Transport
Safety Bureau  said in its final report into the incident,
released today. The chance of a recurrence is “very low,” it
said.  A Boeing Co. 747-400 flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne
diverted to Manila on July 25, 2008, after the oxygen-tank
explosion blew a hole in the plane’s fuselage and caused a loss
of cabin pressure. None of the 369 people on board were injured.  Qantas “welcomed” the findings of the report, spokesman
Thomas Woodward said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
