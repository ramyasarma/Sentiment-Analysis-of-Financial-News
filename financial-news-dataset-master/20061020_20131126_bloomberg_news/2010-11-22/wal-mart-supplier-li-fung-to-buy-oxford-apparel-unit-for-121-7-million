Li & Fung Ltd. , the biggest supplier
to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., agreed to buy
 Oxford Industries Inc. ’s apparel division for $121.7 million.  Li & Fung, based in Hong Kong, is looking to acquire
manufacturers of brands amid an increase in orders, President
 Bruce Rockowitz  said in January.  Oxford, an Atlanta-based clothing maker, said the sale will
strengthen its  balance sheet  and improve liquidity to help
develop its Tommy Bahama and Ben Sherman brands, according to a
statement distributed on PRNewswire today.  The asset sale by Oxford will result in a gain of about
$2.80 a share and cash proceeds of about $90 million after
certain expenses and income taxes. Oxford said it plans to keep
its Oxford Golf business and a Lyons, Georgia, distribution
center that are part of the apparel division  To contact the reporter on this story:
