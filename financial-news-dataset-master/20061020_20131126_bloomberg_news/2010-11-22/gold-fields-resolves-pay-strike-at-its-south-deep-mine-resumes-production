Gold Fields Ltd. , Africa’s second-
biggest producer of the metal, resolved a nine-day strike at its
South Deep mine by  National Union of Mineworkers  members over
increasing the number of black managers at the company.  Output resumed yesterday, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a statement, after the strike began on Nov. 12.  Workers demanded the company appoint more black people as
senior managers and buy more supplies from black-run businesses
to help compensate for their disenfranchisement under apartheid
rule that ended in 1994. The gold mining company “will work
with us to ensure there is representivity at mine level,” said
Lesiba Seshoka, a spokesman for the NUM.  The effect on output at South Deep, still in development,
will be released with the results for the three months through
December,  Sven Lunsche , company spokesman, said by mobile phone.  Gold Fields declined 25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to 117.25
rand by the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
