The U.S. is coordinating a response
to evidence that North Korea has advanced its nuclear program
and is taking steps to pressure  Kim Jong Il ’s regime back
to negotiations, a White House spokesman said.  “The North Koreans have to be serious about living up to
their obligations” to dismantle their nuclear-weapons program
if they expect progress in negotiations toward more normal
relations with other countries, press secretary  Robert Gibbs 
told a White House briefing yesterday. “We do not wish to talk
simply for the sake of talking.”  U.S. State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley  said
North Korea often uses advances in its nuclear program as a
bargaining chip to draw the U.S. and other countries into
negotiations.  “We will not be drawn into rewarding North Korea for bad
behavior,” Crowley told a State Department briefing.  The North Korean claim to have built a uranium enrichment
facility “violates its international obligations,” Crowley
said, referring to a 2005 joint statement by the so-called six-
party nations -- the U.S., North Korea, South Korea, China,
Japan and Russia -- in which North Korea pledged to abandon its
nuclear program.  The administration learned of North Korea’s advances after
U.S. scientists were invited to the country to tour its latest
nuclear plant for enriching uranium this month. The finding
prompted President  Barack Obama  to dispatch envoy  Stephen Bosworth  to the region to talk with other nations involved in
the six-party talks.  U.S. Tactical Nuclear Weapons  Bosworth said today in Tokyo the disarmament talks won’t
resume while North Korea pursues the uranium program, according
to the Associated Press. Bosworth travels to Beijing today on
the last day of his trip, which included a stop in South Korea.  Deploying U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea
could be considered as a response to North Korea’s nuclear
threat, South Korea’s Defense Minister Kim Tae Young said
yesterday. Kim was responding to a lawmaker’s question on
whether he was open to considering the option.  The ministry in Seoul later issued a  statement  that the
government is not officially considering asking the U.S. to
redeploy tactical nuclear weapons, which were removed in the
early 1990s.  ‘Astonishingly Modern’  “The control room was astonishingly modern,” Stanford
University professor Siegfried S. Hecker wrote in a Nov. 20
 report  of his visit eight days earlier to the main reactor site
at Yongbyon.  “We saw a modern, clean centrifuge plant of more than a
thousand centrifuges,” he wrote, referring to the high-speed
spinning devices that enrich uranium.  Victor Cha , director of Asian affairs at the White House
from 2004 to 2007, said that the advanced quality of the
equipment was striking.  “It appeared to be much further advanced and much further
along than anything we suspected North Korea capable of doing,”
Cha said, speaking at an event at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.  Not Just One  The advanced nature of the control room and its equipment
could also indicate that it isn’t the only facility of its kind,
he said.  “Just the fact that the facility is so sophisticated and
complete leads one to believe there must be other facilities,”
said Cha, who holds the Korea Chair at CSIS and is a former
deputy head of delegation to the six-party talks.  Ambassador  Sung Kim , the current U.S. special envoy to the
six-party talks, said the situation had gotten “more
dangerous.”  He noted that the last round of talks had taken place in
December 2008, almost two years ago. “The negotiation process
is broken,” he said.  “This is what one person described to me as the land of no
good choices,” Sung said of North Korea. “Your choices are
bad, worse and the worst, and this is a quintessential example
of that.”  One key factor moving forward will be to ensure China’s
involvement in reining North Korea in, both Cha and Sung said.  Closest Ally  China is North Korea’s closest ally and often protects the
isolated regime when it comes under fire, as it did after it was
accused of sinking a South Korean naval vessel in March.  Sung said that assuming the six-party talks restart, the
U.S. goal would aim to get back into them “with the Chinese on
your side.” The Chinese, he added, would see a resumption of
talks as in their interests.  North Korea “is clearly destabilizing to the region and
China knows that,” he said. “We do share a common goal.”  Cha sounded a more cautious note about China’s cooperation.  “The Chinese position is very important,” Cha said. “We
want the Chinese to say this is a violation of the six-party
commitments. That’s where we want the Chinese to start, not make
excuses.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
