Indonesia’s rupiah rose for a third
straight day on speculation a rescue deal for Ireland’s banks
will revive investor appetite for higher-yielding emerging-
market assets.  The currency climbed to its strongest level in a week as
the euro advanced after Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said
Ireland will seek less than 100 billion euros ($137 billion) in
aid from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
The rupiah has appreciated 5.1 percent this year as official
data show overseas investors’ holdings of Indonesian bonds
climbed 78 percent to 192.8 trillion rupiah ($21.6 billion).  “The market is still expecting inflows from offshore
players, mostly on investments into the bond market,” said
 Wiling Bolung , head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta.
The rupiah may trade between 8,900 and 8,950 this week, he
predicted.  The rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 8,931 per dollar as of
9:03 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 8,875 on Nov. 5, the strongest level since
June 2007.  Gains in the currency will be limited by Bank Indonesia’s
purchases of the dollar, Bolung said. “BI wants to reduce
volatility,” he said.  Indonesia’s policy rate of 6.50 percent is the highest
among Asia’s largest economies, and its benchmark 10-year bonds
 yield  4.53 percentage points more than similar-dated U.S.
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
