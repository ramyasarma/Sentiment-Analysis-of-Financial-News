CEZ AS, the biggest Czech power
producer, should be exempt from paying tax on carbon credits,
 E15  reported, citing an interview with Supervisory Board
Chairman Martin Riman.  If CEZ is forced to pay the tax, devised to finance
subsidies for renewable energy producers, it could see its
rating reduced, the newspaper cited Riman as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
