Google Inc. is in advanced talks to
buy Groupon Inc., a Chicago-based startup, for about $2.5
billion, the New York Post reported, citing two people familiar
with the talks.  The merger would give Google a bigger slice of the
estimated $133 billion local advertising market, and the deal
may be announced as early as next month; Groupon gets merchants
to advertise coupons and if enough of its subscribers demand
them, Groupon makes them available and keeps a cut of the sale,
the newspaper said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
