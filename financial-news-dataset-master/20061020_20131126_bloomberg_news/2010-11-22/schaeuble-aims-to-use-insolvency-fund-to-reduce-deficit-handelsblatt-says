German Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble will indirectly use 1.1 billion euros from the Federal
Labor Agency’s fund to support employees at insolvent companies
to lower the deficit, Handelsblatt reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The federal government plans to transfer 5.8 billion euros
to the Labor Agency instead of the expected 6.9 billion euros
for 2010 after funds for insolvent companies benefitted from the
good economy, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
