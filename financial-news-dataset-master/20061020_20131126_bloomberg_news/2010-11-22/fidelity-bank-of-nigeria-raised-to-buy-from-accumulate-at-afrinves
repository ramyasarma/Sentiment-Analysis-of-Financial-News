Fidelity Bank Plc, a Nigerian
lender, had its recommendation raised to “buy” at Afrinvest
West Africa Ltd., the Lagos-based brokerage said in an e-mailed
note to clients dated Nov. 19.  The recommendation was increased from “accumulate,”
analyst Babatunde Obaniyi said separately in a telephone
interview from the city today. Afrinvest has a six-month price
estimate of 3.49 naira per share.  “Fidelity is one of the best banks when it comes to
containing costs and this reflects in its margin improvement”
for the nine months through September, Obaniyi said. Interest
margins improved by 4.7 percent in the period, Afrinvest said in
the note.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
