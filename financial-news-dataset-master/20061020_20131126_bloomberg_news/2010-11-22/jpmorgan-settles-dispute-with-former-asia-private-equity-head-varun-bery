JPMorgan Chase & Co.  settled a
dispute with  Varun Bery , who had sued the bank in Hong Kong for
breaching an agreement that allowed him to leave with the
private equity team and platform he managed.  Bery will provide private equity consultancy services to
JPMorgan, they said in a joint statement announcing the
“amicable resolution.”  Bery, who co-founded private equity firm TVG Capital
Partners Ltd., sued JPMorgan Private Capital Asia Corp. in April,
claiming damages “in the region of $30.8 million.” Bery joined
JPMorgan in 2008 to head the bank’s Asian private equity
business and was told in 2009 that the bank wouldn’t commit more
capital to it, or allow it to be spun out, according to the
lawsuit. He left the bank in November 2009.  Bery continues to operate as managing director of TVG and
JPMorgan wishes him every success in the future, according to
the statement.  JPMorgan spokesman  Ray Bashford  and TVG spokeswoman Emily
Chow declined to comment on whether the spin out will be allowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
