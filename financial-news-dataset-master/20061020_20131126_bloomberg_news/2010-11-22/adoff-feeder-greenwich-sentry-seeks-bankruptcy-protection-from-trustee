Greenwich Sentry LP, a feeder fund
for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc., sought
bankruptcy protection from creditors including the Madoff
trustee, who is trying to recover $206 million.  The fund and affiliate Greenwich Sentry Partners LP listed
assets and debts of as much as $500 million each in a Nov. 19
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Madoff trustee
 Irving H. Picard , who is pressing claims of fraudulent transfer
against Greenwich, is the largest unsecured creditor.  The funds’ “immediate objective is to obtain a breathing
spell from the various litigations,” Greenwich Sentry General
Counsel  Mark McKeefry  said in court papers. In addition to
Picard, investors brought lawsuits in state court against the
fund’s managers for aiding the Madoff fraud.  The investment partnerships used a form of “non-
traditional options trading” implemented by Madoff, McKeefry
said. Madoff was arrested in 2008 for operating the largest
Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. He is serving a 150-year prison
term after pleading guilty to fraud.  The Greenwich funds have been conducting “good faith”
discussions with Picard and will propose a plan to settle all
the suits, McKeefry said.  The main bankruptcy case is In re Greenwich Sentry LP, 10-
16229, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
