Rwanda plans to raise 17.5 billion
francs ($29.5 million) from the sale of its 25 percent stake in
 Heineken NV’s  Brasseries et Limonaderies du Rwanda SA through an
initial public offering, said Finance Minister  John Rwangombwa .  The offer, which starts tomorrow and runs until Dec. 17,
will sell 128,570,000 shares at 136 francs each, he told
reporters in Kigali, the capital, today. The shares will start
trading on the East African country’s bourse on Jan. 21, he
said.  The government sold an additional 5 percent stake to
Amsterdam-based Heineken, which already owns 70 percent of the
brewer, on Nov. 11, Rwangombwa said.  The offer “marks a significant step in the transformation
and maturity of Rwanda’s nascent capital market,” he said.
Rwanda’s over-the-counter exchange currently lists two
companies:  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd.  and  Nation Media Group
Ltd.  Both are cross-listed and have their primary issues on the
Nairobi Stock Exchange in neighboring Kenya.  Rwangombwa said other partially state-owned companies may
sell shares through the bourse, including cement-maker Ciments
du Rwanda Ltd. and lenders Bank of Kigali, Rwanda Commercial
Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
