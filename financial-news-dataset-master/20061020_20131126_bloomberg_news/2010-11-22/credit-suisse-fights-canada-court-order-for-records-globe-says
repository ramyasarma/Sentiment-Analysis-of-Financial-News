Credit Suisse Group AG  is fighting a
federal court order requiring the Swiss bank to surrender
records to Canadian tax collectors, the Globe and Mail reported.  Canada Revenue Agency auditors obtained an order in October
demanding the bank provide the records, based on a client’s
claims that he was encouraged by his investment adviser to hide
savings abroad, the Globe said, citing court documents. Credit
Suisse, which ran private banking offices in Vancouver, Toronto
and Montreal until 1998, applied to the court to nullify the
order, calling it “inordinately broad”.  No date has been set for the case.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
