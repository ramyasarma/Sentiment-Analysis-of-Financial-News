Sky Deutschland AG , the German pay-
television operator part owned by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp.,
said the nation’s financial regulator found flaws in its
statements regarding profit, credit risks and subscriber counts.  BaFin’s findings in the annual 2007 and first-half 2008
statements, if conclusive, may lead to corrected financial
reports, fines and claims for damages, the company, based in
Unterfoehring near Munich, said yesterday in a statement. Sky
Deutschland said the claims are “inapplicable” and will be
legally reviewed.  The regulator said the pay-TV operator reported profit that
was “too high” by at least 10 million euros ($13.6 million) in
the six months ended June 2008 because of incorrect accounting
for the purchase of 2010 World Cup broadcast rights.  BaFin also said the company didn’t “sufficiently” point
out in the June 2008 report the risk of an unexpected breach of
credit terms and the possibility of banks canceling its credit
lines.  At the end of 2007, the money-losing company’s value was
overstated by 248.4 million euros because of inaccurate
accounting for some acquisitions, the regulator said. Sky
Deutschland overstated its number of subscribers by about
623,000 in 2007 and 611,000 mid-year 2008, according to BaFin.  There is no immediate effect on the balance sheet, the
company said in the statement. New York-based News Corp. owns
49.9 percent of Sky Deutschland, formerly known as Premiere AG.
News Corp. bought an initial 14.6 percent stake in Premiere in
January 2008.  Sky Deutschland shares fell 12.4 percent to 1.37 euros in
Frankfurt trading as of 9:06 a.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
