Gina Rinehart , Australia’s richest
woman, raised her stake in Ten Network Holdings Ltd. less than
two weeks after  James Packer  and  Lachlan Murdoch  agreed to join
the board of Australia’s third-ranked television broadcaster.  Hancock Prospecting Pty. Ltd., Rinehart’s family company,
now has 10 percent of Ten’s stock, the Sydney-based broadcaster
said in a stock exchange filing today.  Rinehart, who has earned her fortune from mining, becomes
the third billionaire to own at least 5 percent of Ten,
alongside Packer and  Bruce Gordon .  Lachlan Murdoch, son of News Corp. Chairman Rupert, is
expected to acquire some of the shares owned by Packer, the
Australian Financial Review reported Nov. 17, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
