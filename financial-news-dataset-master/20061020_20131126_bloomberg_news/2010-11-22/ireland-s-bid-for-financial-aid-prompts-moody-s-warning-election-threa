Ireland’s bid for financial aid
yesterday prompted Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  to call elections
after support for his government unraveled.  Cowen made the announcement late today hours after the
Green Party said it would pull out of his coalition. He said the
vote will come early next year after passage of a 2011 budget.  The euro fell and Irish bonds pared their advance after
Moody’s Investors Service said a “ multi-notch” downgrade in
Ireland’s Aa2 credit rating was “most likely” because the aid
would increase the country’s debt burden.  A rescue package that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates
may total 95 billion euros ($130 billion) failed to damp
speculation that Portugal and Spain would follow Ireland in
tapping the fund set up by the European Union and International
Monetary Fund after the Greece rescue.  “It probably won’t halt contagion,” said  Sylvain Broyer ,
chief euro-region economist at Natixis in Frankfurt. “The
sovereign crisis isn’t yet over. Ireland is in the middle of a
difficult crisis.”  The aid, which Irish officials said as recently as Nov. 15
they didn’t need, marks the latest blow to an economy that more
than doubled in the decade ending in 2006. The bursting of the
real-estate bubble in 2008 plunged the country into a recession
and brought its banks close to collapse. With Irish  bond yields 
near a record high, policy makers are trying to keep the crisis
from spreading.  Shrinking Banks  “Clearly because of the size of their loan books, the huge
risks they took, they became a threat not only to the state but
to the” entire euro region, Finance Minister  Brian Lenihan  told
Dublin-based RTE radio in an interview today. “The banks will
be downsized to the real needs of the Irish economy” to “Irish
consumers and Irish businesses. That has to be the primary focus
of Irish banks.”  The euro slid 0.4 percent to $1.3624 at 7:45 p.m. in
London. The yield on Irish 10-year notes fell 5 basis points to
8.3 percent after falling as low as 8.11 percent.  The U.K. and Sweden may contribute bilateral loans, the EU
said in a statement. Lenihan declined to say how big the package
will be, saying that it will be less than 100 billion euros.
Goldman Sachs Chief European Economist  Erik Nielsen  said
yesterday the government needs 65 billion euros to fund itself
for the next three years and 30 billion euros for the banks.  Talks will focus on the government’s deficit-cutting plans
and restructuring the banking system, the EU said in a
statement. The deficit will total about a third of gross
domestic product this year, including injections to banks.  Holding Line on Taxes  Hewlett-Packard Co.,  based in Palo Alto, California, said
it may reconsider its investment in Ireland should the country
raise its 12.5 percent company tax rate as part of a deal to
secure the EU-IMF aid.  “HP is very clear, if the tax rate increased we would be
relooking at our investment in Ireland,”  Lionel Alexander , head
of Hewlett-Packard’s Irish operations said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. “One of the key reasons we came to
Ireland was for the 12.5 percent tax rate, and we think that
should stand as part of these negotiations.”  German government spokesman  Steffen Seibert  said in Berlin
today that “tough” conditions should be applied to the aid and
that an increase in the corporate tax should be considered.  Irish banks may get immediate capital injections,  Matthew Elderfield , the country’s head of financial regulation, said in
a speech today. The country’s two biggest lenders need at least
5 billion euros immediately,  Ciaran Callaghan , an analyst with
NCB Stockbrokers, wrote in a note to clients on Nov. 18.  Ireland nationalized  Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  in 2009 and is
preparing to take a majority stake in  Allied Irish Banks Plc ,
the second-largest bank.  Bigger Than Greece  The package for Ireland will total as much as 60 percent of
gross domestic product, compared with 47 percent for Greece.  Cowen plans to announce the government’s four-year budget
plan this week and said an agreement with the EU and the IMF
will come “in the next few weeks.”  “The most important issue is the passing of this budget,”
Cowen, 50, told reporters. After that “it’s my intention to seek
a dissolution” of the government. When asked about speculation
he planned to resign, Cowen said he wanted to continue leading
his Fianna Fail party.  Parliamentary support for Cowen evaporated today after the
Green Party, his junior coalition partners, called for a January
election and said he “misled’’ voters over the past two weeks.
Two independent lawmakers have also said they may not support
the budget, which is scheduled for Dec. 7.  Initial Resistance  Irish officials initially resisted pressure from the EU to
take any aid, saying they were fully funded until the middle of
2011. European leaders sought to head off contagion from Ireland
and reduce pressure on the European Central Bank to prop up the
country’s lenders by providing them with unlimited liquidity.  Cowen defended his reversal on the need for aid. “I don’t
accept I’m the bogeyman,” he said. “Now circumstances have
changed, we’ve changed our policies.”  The bailout follows two years of budget cuts that failed to
restore  market  confidence as the cost of shoring up the
financial industry soared.  Lenihan cancelled bond auctions for October and November
and announced 6 billion euros of austerity measures for 2011 on
Nov. 4 in a bid to restore investor confidence. Those efforts
failed after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  triggered an
investor exodus by saying bondholders should foot some of the
bill in any future bailout.  Risk Premium  The risk premium on Ireland’s 10-year debt over German
bunds, Europe’s benchmark, fell to 523 basis points today. It
 widened  to a record 652 basis points on Nov. 11, with the yield
reaching a record 9.1 percent. In 2007, it cost Ireland less
than Germany to borrow. Its 10-year spread then fell to as low
as 77 basis points less than bunds. The  ISEQ stock index  has
plunged 70 percent from its record in 2007.  Ireland will draw on the 750-billion-euro fund set up by
the EU and IMF in May as part of the Greek bailout to protect
the currency shared by 16 countries.  Yields on bonds of Spain and Portugal have jumped amid
concern that fallout from Ireland would spread. The extra yield
that investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year bonds instead
of German bunds climbed to a record 484 basis points on Nov. 11.  “Speculative actions against Portugal and Spain are not
justified, though it can’t be excluded,” Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said today on RTL Luxembourg radio.  To contact the reporters on this story:
