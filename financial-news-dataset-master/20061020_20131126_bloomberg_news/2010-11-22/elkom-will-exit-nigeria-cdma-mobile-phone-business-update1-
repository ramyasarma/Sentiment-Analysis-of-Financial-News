Telkom South Africa Ltd.  said it
will exit the CDMA-technology mobile-phone business of its loss-
making Multi-Links unit in Nigeria in the next six months.  Africa’s largest fixed-line phone  company  is “in the
process of engaging a couple of parties with respect to the
exit,”  Jeffrey Hedberg , Pretoria-based Telkom’s acting chief
executive officer, said on a conference call today. “Given the
clear need for speed, we need to move in a way that is going to
stop the burn rather than extend the burn.”  Multi-Links made a net loss of 262 million rand ($37.6
million) in the six months through September, according to a
presentation today. The unit accounts for about 90 percent of
Telkom’s business in Africa’s most-populous nation, Acting Chief
Financial Officer  Deon Fredericks  said on the call. Multi-Links
hasn’t made a profit since Telkom  purchased  it for $410 million
in 2007.  The exit may cost $100 million to $180 million, excluding
any money from selling physical assets such as transmission
towers, Hedberg said. He said there is still “strategic
potential” for the rest of the business in Nigeria, which
includes 7,000 kilometers of fiber-optic cable, 2,000 kilometers
of which is shared with MTN Group Ltd., Africa’s largest mobile-
phone operator, and Nigeria’s Globacom Ltd.  Multi-Links has “an expansive, well-developed network, in
particular its fiber-optic network which Telkom has not utilized
fully to its advantage until lately,” London-based Frost &
Sullivan analyst  Spiwe Chireka , said in an e-mailed note today.  Data Business  Telkom  is in discussions with companies in Nigeria “about
increasing in-country scale and minimizing our exposure,” with
the data part of the Multi-Links business that it’s keeping,
Hedberg said. “We believe the bleed there is far less so we are
going to take our time in order to make a good decision.”  The company’s net income fell to 1.01 billion rand in the
six months through September from 39.7 billion rand a year
earlier, as income of 40.4 billion rand from the sale of a stake
in Vodacom Group Ltd. wasn’t repeated, Telkom said in a
statement today. Total revenue dropped 6.5 percent to 18 billion
rand.  Telkom shares  fell 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, to 35.86 rand
at the 5 p.m. close of Johannesburg trading.  Oil, gas and resources companies and banks will be targeted
as customers who need fixed-line data services with the high
transmission speeds that fiber can provide, Hedberg said.  Telkom must “make sure it gets things right with Multi-
Link because from its current portfolio of companies, excluding
South Africa,  Multi-Links  holds the largest potential” to make
a success of Telkom’s pan-African strategy, Chireka said.  Voice Revenue  In South Africa, voice revenue has been falling as
consumers substitute fixed-line for mobile services and
corporate clients migrate to voice services via the Internet,
said  Pinky Moholi , managing director for the country. Voice
revenue in the six months through September declined 19 percent
to 6.9 billion rand.  In the corporate market, “rather than lose the customer
totally,” Telkom aims to “at least be the seller of the data
solution” and facilitate the migration to voice over the
Internet, Moholi said.  Telkom launched its 8ta mobile offering in October,
competing with  Vodacom Group Ltd. , the largest provider of
mobile-phone services to South Africans, and  MTN . It will spend
6 billion rand over five years rolling out its network.  “Telkom’s new mobile service is anticipated to retain and
expand Telkom’s customer base while growing revenue for the
company,” Chireka, said. “Competition in South African market
has become cutthroat.”  Bundled Services  Customers will be able to start receiving a single bill for
fixed-line voice and Internet services as well as the mobile
offering by about March or April as new bundled services will be
sold to new and existing customers, Moholi said.  Telkom is stabilizing its fixed-line business, said Moholi.
“In order for us to up-sell broadband, we need to have fixed
line into people’s homes,” she said. “If you don’t have the
fixed-line you can’t even have an opportunity to up-sell those
services,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
