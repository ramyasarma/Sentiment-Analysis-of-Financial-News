Asian stocks  rose, sending the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to a one-week high, as the euro strengthened
against the yen after Ireland applied for a bailout to help fund
itself and save its banks.  Samsung Electronics Co. , the South Korean electronics maker
that gets about 22 percent of sales from Europe, climbed 3.7
percent.  HTC Corp. , a Taiwanese maker of mobile-phone handsets,
surged 5.9 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s biggest
automaker, gained 1.1 percent.  Mitsubishi Corp. , the Japanese
trader that gets about 40 percent of sales from commodities,
rose 1.4 percent after crude oil and copper futures advanced
today.  “The Irish bailout will ease global credit market
concerns,” said  Jason Teh , who helps manage about $2.6 billion
at Investors Mutual Ltd. in Sydney. “Disruptive credit markets
aren’t good for anybody, but bailouts do mean that we’re in a
period of slower growth. Austerity measures will take time to
resolve the many problems of these highly-geared countries.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  rose 0.7 percent to 132.68 as
of 7:43 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for its highest close since Nov.
11. Concern over how China will tackle the fastest inflation in
two years triggered a global stock rout that wiped more than $1
trillion off global equities in the past two weeks.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  gained 0.9 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3 percent. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index increased 0.9 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite
Index climbed 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.4 percent as a gauge
that tracks the shares of seven of the city’s largest developers
tumbled the most since August 16 after the government unveiled
new measures to prevent a real-estate price bubble.  China Reserve Ratio  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.3
percent today. In New York, the index advanced 0.3 percent on
Nov. 19 as higher-than-estimated profit at Dell Inc., the
world’s third-largest supplier of personal computers, and a
dividend increase at Nike Inc., the biggest maker of athletic
shoes, overshadowed concern China’s steps to slow inflation will
stifle global economic growth.  China ordered banks to set aside larger reserves for the
fifth time this year, draining cash from the financial system in
the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The ratio will
increase 50 basis points starting Nov. 29, the central bank said
on its website on Nov. 19.  Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  said on Nov. 21 in Dublin
that he expects talks on the details of financial assistance for
Ireland to be completed in the “next few weeks.” Finance
Minister  Brian Lenihan  said the loan will be less than 100
billion euros ($137 billion). He declined to give further
details at a press conference in Dublin.  Information Technology  “A solution to Ireland’s problems helps reduce the
contagion risk with respect to other countries in Europe with
more immediate refinancing requirements,” said  Will Seddon , who
helps manage about $350 million at White Funds Management Pty.
in Sydney.  Samsung Electronics climbed 3.7 percent to 848,000 won.  LG

to 114.77 against the euro, compared with 113.65 at the close of
stock trading in Tokyo on Nov. 19. Against the dollar, Japan’s
currency weakened to 83.57 from 83.35. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  Toyota increased 1.1 percent to 3,300 yen.  Fanuc Ltd. , a
Japanese maker of industrial robots, gained 0.9 percent 12,050
yen. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, rose 1
percent to 4,050 yen.  “Exporters will likely advance as the yen is in a
weakening trend, and corporate earnings are strong in the
U.S.,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at
Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  Copper, Oil  Mitsubishi Corp. gained 1.4 percent to 2,145 yen.  Inpex
Corp. , Japan’s biggest energy explorer, climbed 3.6 percent to

dropped as home sales tumbled 83 percent during the weekend from
the previous week. Financial Secretary  John Tsang  on Nov. 19
raised stamp duty and increased deposits, the toughest measures
yet to rein in home values that soared 50 percent since January
2009.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the world’s biggest developer,
fell 3.1 percent to HK$130.10. Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd., Hong
