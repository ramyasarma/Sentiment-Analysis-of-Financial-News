Hyundai Group , the preferred bidder
for  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. , plans to target
contracts in Brazil and Russia to help the builder increase
orders almost 10-fold by 2020.  South Korea’s largest construction company may receive 150
trillion won ($133 billion) of new orders in 2020 from 15.7
trillion won last year, the group said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Sales  may climb to 60 trillion won from 9.3 trillion
won, it said.  Hyundai Group also said  operating profit  may jump more than
10-fold to 5 trillion won as it seeks to allay concerns about
plans to buy 35 percent of Hyundai Engineering for a price said
to be more than double the market value. The group’s largest
unit, Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., has tumbled 21 percent in
Seoul trading since Hyundai Group was named preferred bidder for
the controlling stake last week.  Hyundai Engineering will target Brazil and Russia as rising
oil prices stoke investment in refineries and energy pipelines.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA is working through the world’s largest
oil-exploration plan. The construction company has previously
won contracts for energy projects in countries including the
United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Kuwait.  Hyundai Group will also help Hyundai Engineering develop
reclaimed land near Seoul into an environmentally friendly
industrial complex and housing, it said. The  construction
company  earned 52 percent of revenue in South Korea last year,
and 38 percent in the Middle East.  Hyundai Engineering  fell 3.5 percent to 60,200 won in Seoul
trading.  Hyundai Merchant  declined 3.9 percent to 35,700 won.  Hyundai Group offered about 5.5 trillion won for the
Hyundai Engineering stake, beating a rival bid from the
country’s biggest automaker, according to two people familiar
with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
