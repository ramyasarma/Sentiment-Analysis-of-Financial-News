Yuan forwards gained for a third day
after China’s central bank ordered an increase in lenders’
reserve ratios to help tame the fastest inflation in two years.  The People’s Bank of China said Nov. 19 it would raise the
amount of cash banks must set aside as reserves by 50 basis
points from Nov. 29. The rate could be lifted by a further 50 to
100 basis points before the end of the year, said  Lu Zhengwei , a
senior economist at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai.  “China is not going to overdo monetary tightening and the
focus will be more on liquidity management rather than overkill
with interest rates,” said  Dariusz Kowalczyk , a senior
economist and strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.1 percent to
6.4535 per dollar as of 10:37 a.m. in Hong Kong, reflecting bets
the currency will strengthen 2.9 percent in a year from the spot
rate of 6.6378, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System.  Consumer prices climbed 4.4 percent in October from a year
earlier compared with a 3.6 percent gain in September, official
data showed on Nov. 11.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.03 percent stronger today at 6.6389. The  Dollar Index  traded
on ICE futures in New York, which tracks the greenback against
the currencies of six major trading partners, fell 0.5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the fourth day
of declines.  “There is a reduction in risk aversion to Asian emerging-
market currencies,” Kowalczyk said. “The market is reacting
positively to the Ireland bailout news,” he added.  Ireland applied for a European Union-led bailout to save
its banks. Talks on the rescue package are due to be completed
in the “next few weeks,” Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said
yesterday.  -- Sonja Cheung . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  Simon Harvey   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
