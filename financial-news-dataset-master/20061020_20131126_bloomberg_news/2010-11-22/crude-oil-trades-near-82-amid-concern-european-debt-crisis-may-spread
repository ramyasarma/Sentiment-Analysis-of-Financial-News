Oil traded near $82 a barrel in New
York after climbing earlier today as analyst estimates showed
crude inventories dropped for a third week in the U.S., the
world’s biggest consumer of the commodity.  An Energy Department report tomorrow will  probably show 
supplies slipped 2 million barrels last week from 357.6 million,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts. Stockpiles
plunged 7.29 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 12, the
biggest decrease since August 2009.  “The U.S. is still the top nation for consumption, so our
inventories will tend to dictate the market,”  Mike Sander , of
Sander Capital Advisors in Seattle, said in an e-mailed response
to questions. “The price could go up. It all depends on the
market sentiment.”  The January delivery contract was at $81.72 a barrel, down
2 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 9:33 a.m. Singapore time. Earlier, it advanced as
much as 0.4 percent to $82.10. Yesterday, the contract lost 24
cents to $81.74. Prices are up 3.1 percent this year.  Futures declined 0.3 percent yesterday amid speculation
that Europe’s debt crisis will spread, crimping economic growth
and reducing fuel demand. Moody’s Investors Service said the
bailout of Ireland by the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund may raise the debt burden and pose a “credit
negative” for the country.  Fuel Inventories  The Energy Department report will  probably show  that
gasoline supplies fell 1.25 million barrels, according to the
survey. Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, slid 900,000 barrels, the survey shows.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries doesn’t
need to boost output, and $100 is a fair price for crude,  Rafael Ramirez , president of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, Venezuela’s
state-owned oil company, said yesterday. The country is OPEC’s
sixth-largest oil producer. OPEC oil ministers will meet next
month in Quito, Ecuador.  Brent crude for January settlement traded at $83.91 a
barrel, down 5 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Yesterday, it fell 38 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$83.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
