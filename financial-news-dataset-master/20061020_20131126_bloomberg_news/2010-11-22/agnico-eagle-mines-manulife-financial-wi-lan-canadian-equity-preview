     Nov. 22 (Bloomberg) --  Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in four days as Manulife Financial Corp. declined after a
share downgrade and the bailout of Ireland failed to eliminate
concern over Europe’s debt crisis.  Manulife, North America’s fourth-largest insurer, decreased
3.1 percent as  financial companies  dropped the most in six days.
Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer,
declined 1 percent as crude oil retreated. DundeeWealth Inc.
surged 6.6 percent after Bank of Nova Scotia agreed to buy the
money manager.  Manulife “is still very sensitive to equity and bond
markets,” said  Murray Leith , who helps manage C$6.5 billion
($6.38 billion) as a money manager at Odlum Brown Ltd. in
Vancouver. “When the world gets a bit more negative on
equities, and they sell off, Manulife is going to sell off
more.”  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  lost 27.32
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,929.01.  The index rose 2.4 percent on Nov. 18 and 19, the biggest
two-day gain since July 7, after Ireland’s finance minister said
the country was prepared to accept an aid package. The S&P/TSX
had decreased the most in almost three months the previous week
as Irish 10-year government bond yields surged as high as 8.89
percent.  Ireland applied for a bailout from the European Union and
International Monetary Fund yesterday to help pay for the rescue
of its banks.  Opposite Effect  Oil declined and precious metals gained today after Moody’s
Investors Service said the EU-IMF package may actually increase
the country’s debt burden. A “multi-notch downgrade” of
Ireland’s Aa2 rating is the “most likely outcome” of a review
of its credit, the ratings company said.  Oil futures fell 0.3 percent, extending their two-week
retreat to 6.8 percent.  Suncor dropped 1 percent to C$34.89. Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd., Canada’s second-largest energy company by market
value, declined 1.3 percent to C$39.97. EnCana Corp., the
country’s biggest natural gas producer, lost 1.1 percent to
C$28.95.  Gold advanced 0.4 percent after two straight weekly losses.
Silver increased 1 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer,
climbed 0.7 percent to C$51.08. Kinross Gold Corp., Canada’s
 third-biggest  producer, rose 1.1 percent to C$18.43. Silver
Wheaton rallied 4.3 percent to a record C$36.77.  Manulife Declines  Manulife decreased 3.1 percent to C$14.88 after  Colin W. Devine , an analyst at Citigroup Inc., cut its  rating  to “sell”
from “hold.” “Management appears to us to still be in denial
about Manulife’s diminished financial circumstances and the
magnitude of the problems it faces, particularly in the U.S.,”
Devine said in a note to clients.  Manulife has plunged 23 percent this year, the most among
stocks in the  S&P/TSX 60  index of Canada’s largest and most-
heavily traded companies. The owner of John Hancock Financial
Services Inc. halved its dividend last year and has missed the
average analyst profit estimate 8 of the last 11 quarters.  “Because they disappointed investors so much, they had so
many quarters where they announced disturbing news that was so
much worse than expectations, it’s going to be a long road to
rebuild investor confidence,” said Leith, who owns Manulife
shares.  Insurers Fall  Sun Life Financial Inc., Canada’s third-largest insurer,
retreated 1.2 percent to C$28.62. Great-West Lifeco Inc., the
No. 2 insurer by revenue, slipped 1.4 percent to C$25.68.  Canada’s  five largest banks  each fell. Royal Bank of
Canada, the biggest, dropped 0.9 percent to C$54.83. Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, the No. 5 lender by assets, declined
0.5 percent to C$78.66. Scotiabank, Canada’s third-biggest bank,
lost 0.8 percent to C$54.20.  DundeeWealth increased 6.6 percent to a post-2007 high of
C$20.75. Scotiabank will pay C$21 a share in cash or stock for
the 82 percent of the company it does not already own. Financial
holding company Dundee Corp., which owns  59 percent  of
DundeeWealth, surged 5 percent to C$19.22.  Potash One Inc., which explores for the crop nutrient in
Saskatchewan, soared 25 percent, the most since January 2009, to
C$4.53 after agreeing to a takeover by K&S AG of Kassel,
Germany. Potash One shareholders would receive C$4.50 a share in
cash.  Neo Material Technologies Inc., which makes rare-earths
products in China, jumped 13 percent to a record C$6.68. The
shares have rallied 86 percent over the past four months as
China reduced its exports of rare-earth metals.  To contact the reporter on this story;
