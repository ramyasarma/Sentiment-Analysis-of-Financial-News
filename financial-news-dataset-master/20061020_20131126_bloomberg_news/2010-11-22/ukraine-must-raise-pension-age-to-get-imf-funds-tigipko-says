Ukraine will have a hard time
getting the next loan installment from the  International
Monetary Fund  unless it raises the retirement age, Deputy Prime
Minister  Serhiy Tigipko  said.  “Without raising the pension age, it will be very
difficult for us to get approval from the IMF executive board”
for the next tranche, Tigipko said in televised remarks
broadcast Nov. 19. “We cannot do without the IMF yet.”  Ukraine secured a $15.2 billion IMF loan program in July,
with the first $1.9 billion tranche paid immediately. The
Washington-based lender’s mission to Ukraine last week
recommended release of the next $1 billion installment,
providing the government meets certain conditions. The bank’s
board will make final decision by the end of the year.  Ukraine has to cut its budget deficit to 3.5 percent of
gross domestic product next year from 5.5 percent in 2010.
Finance Minister  Fedir Yaroshenko  said Nov. 19 that GDP will
grow 4.5 percent next year,  Kommersant-Ukraine  newspaper
reported today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
