The Scottish Football Association
may bring in match officials from abroad to combat a planned
strike by soccer referees.  SFA Chief Executive Officer Stewart Regan said talks will
continue with referees’ representatives in an effort to avert
disruption to next weekend’s games.  “While we remain hopeful that the situation can be
resolved to everyone’s satisfaction, we have no option
but to draw up contingency plans, which will involve sourcing
match officials in other countries,” he said  on the SFA
website .  The referees are unhappy at the amount and intensity of
criticism they get from clubs and fans over their decisions on
game incidents. They see their integrity as being attacked, and
have concerns about their safety.  “I have every sympathy for the refereeing fraternity at
this time and completely understand why incessant scrutiny,
criticism and questioning of their integrity has brought them to
the brink of a withdrawal of labor,” Regan said. “I cannot,
however, condone what will amount to strike action.”  Earlier, SFA President  George Peat  said the ruling body
would do everything possible to avert the strike.  He told a televised news conference that the decision by
top-category referees to refuse match appointments was a “sad
day” for the sport in Scotland.  “We will do everything we possibly can to broker a deal
before the weekend because it’s obviously important that
officials are on duty,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
