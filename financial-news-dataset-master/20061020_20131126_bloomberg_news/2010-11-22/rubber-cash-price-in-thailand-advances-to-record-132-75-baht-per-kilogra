The cash price of natural rubber in
Thailand, the largest producer and exporter, advanced to a
record 132.75 baht ($4.44) per kilogram as floods devastated
trees, lowering production in the country’s south, according
to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand. The southern
provinces account for 68 percent of total plantation area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
