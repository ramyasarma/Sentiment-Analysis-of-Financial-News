Kia Motors Corp.  will begin selling
new vehicles through  EBay Inc.  as South Korea’s second-largest
automaker looks to increase brand recognition in the U.S. with
the help of the second-most visited e-commerce site.  More than 300 of Kia’s 725 U.S. dealers are enrolled to
list their inventory on EBay and kia.ebay.com, said  Tom Loveless , Kia’s vice president of U.S. sales. EBay is pushing to
expand sales of new vehicles, parts and services, which make up
a smaller portion of revenue than used cars and trucks, said
Nicolas Franchet, EBay Motors’ director of U.S. vehicles.  Kia, based in Seoul, will finish the year with its best
market share since entering the U.S. in 1994, Franchet said. The
automaker introduced seven new vehicles in the past 18 months,
including the Soul hatchback and Sorento sport-utility vehicle.  EBay’s arrangement with Kia is similar to its new-vehicle
promotion in California with  General Motors Co.  last year, which
the automaker let expire after about eight weeks.  Kia’s Loveless and EBay’s Franchet declined to give
financial details of the arrangement. EBay, based in San Jose,
California, has deals with about half of the auto manufacturers
in the U.S. for listing used vehicles, Franchet said.  “This exposes our brand to a percentage of the car-buying
public that perhaps wouldn’t otherwise have considered us,”
Loveless said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
