A  Delta Air Lines  Inc. plane bound
for Moscow from New York City returned to John F. Kennedy
International Airport after one of its engines had an automatic
shutdown, the  Federal Aviation Administration  said.  Delta Flight 30 landed safely at 5:49 p.m. local time and
taxied to the ramp without further incident, FAA spokeswoman
 Holly Baker  said in a telephone interview. Earlier reports of a
fire on the Boeing 767 were not accurate, she said.  Firefighters and emergency personnel were called to the
scene.  Baker said she didn’t know what time the airplane took off.
The shutdown occurred in the left engine, Baker said. The
airplane departed at 4:30 p.m., according to the FlightAware.com
tracking website.  The FAA is investigating the incident, Baker said.  The airplane had 193 passengers and 11 crew members on
board, CNN reported. They were to take a later flight tonight to
Moscow.  A spokesman for Delta Air didn’t immediately return a phone
call to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
