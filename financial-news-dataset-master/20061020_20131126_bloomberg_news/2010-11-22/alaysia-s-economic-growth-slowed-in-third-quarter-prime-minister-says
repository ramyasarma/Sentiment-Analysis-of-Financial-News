Malaysia’s economic growth was lower
in the third quarter than the 8.9 percent gross domestic product
expansion achieved in the three preceding months, Prime
Minister Najib Razak told reporters in Kuala Lumpur today.  This was due to external factors and lower manufacturing
demand, he said. The economy may still grow by as much as seven
percent for the full year, Najib said. The government will
announce third-quarter growth data at 6 p.m. local time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
