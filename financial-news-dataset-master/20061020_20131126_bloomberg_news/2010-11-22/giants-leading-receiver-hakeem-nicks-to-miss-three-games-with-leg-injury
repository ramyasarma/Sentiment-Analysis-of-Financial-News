New York Giants wide receiver  Hakeem Nicks  is expected to miss about three weeks of action because of
a leg injury, the team said on its website.  Nicks is being treated for  Compartment Syndrome  as a result
of a hit he took to his lower right leg last night in a 27-17
loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the Giants said. Compartment
Syndrome is a condition where excessive pressure builds inside
an enclosed space in the body, usually resulting from swelling
or bleeding after an injury, according to  WebMD.com . It can lead
to muscle and nerve damage if not treated immediately.  Nicks is undergoing a procedure today at the Hospital for
Special Surgery to address the issue.  The 22-year-old leads the Giants with 62 receptions for 800
yards and nine touchdowns this season.  The Giants, who are 6-4 and trail the Eagles by one game in
the National Football Conference’s East Division, host the
Jacksonville Jaguars and Washington Redskins the next two weeks
before playing at the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 12.  New York announced last week that receiver  Steve Smith  will
be out until December because of a torn pectoral muscle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
