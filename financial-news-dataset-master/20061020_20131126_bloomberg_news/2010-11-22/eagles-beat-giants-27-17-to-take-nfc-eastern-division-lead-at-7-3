The Philadelphia Eagles beat the New
York Giants 27-17 to extend their winning streak to three games
and take sole possession of first place in their division.  LeSean McCoy ran 50 yards for a touchdown on a 4th-and-1
play with 4:34 left to put the Eagles back in front after they
blew a 16-3 lead at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.   Michael Vick added a four-yard touchdown run and David
Akers kicked four field goals for the Eagles, who improved to 7-
3 on the National Football League season.   Philadelphia opens a one-game lead in the National Football
Conference’s East Division over the Giants, who fell to 6-4 and
have lost two straight. Giants quarterback Eli Manning threw
three interceptions and also lost a fumble at the Eagles’ 40-
yard line with 2:51 remaining.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
