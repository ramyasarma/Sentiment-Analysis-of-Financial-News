The Nairobi Stock Exchange’s link to
brokers has been restored, said Godfrey Omilly, senior officer
of product development at the Kenyan bourse.  The problem delayed trading by about 30 minutes, with the
market opening at 10 a.m., he said in an e-mailed statement from
the city today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
