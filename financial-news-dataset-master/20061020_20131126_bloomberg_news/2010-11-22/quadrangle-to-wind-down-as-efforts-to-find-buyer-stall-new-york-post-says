Quadrangle Group LLC, the leveraged-
buyout firm co-founded by Steven Rattner, is winding down, the
New York Post reported on its website, citing unidentified
people familiar with the firm’s plans.  The group will attempt to change format under a new name in
the coming weeks, the Post reported. The firm “wants to change
its skill set,” the Post reported, citing another unidentified
person familiar with the firm’s plans.  A second set of principals, Michael Huber and Peter
Ezersky, will stay to manage assets, the Post reported. The new
business will likely focus on managing client assets, the Post
reported, citing an unidentified source.  Rattner last week agreed to pay $6.2 million to settle a
Securities and Exchange Commission probe of kickbacks in
connection with the New York state pension fund.  Quadrangle’s efforts to find a buyer may have stalled with
some prospective investors, including Carlyle Group and Oaktree
Capital Management, the Post reported.  Quadrangle is down to about $2.5 billion from a peak of
about $6 billion, the Post reported.  Quadrangle Asset Management has handled the personal and
philanthropic finances of New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg,
whom Rattner supported through his chairmanship of Democrats for
Bloomberg during the 2005 re-election campaign.  Bloomberg is the majority owner of  Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
