Corn declined for a second straight
session on speculation that falling gasoline prices may slow
demand for ethanol made from grain.  Gasoline dropped the most in almost five weeks on concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is spreading, threatening economic
growth and fuel demand.  Ethanol inventories  jumped 4.1 percent
in the week ended Nov. 12 to the highest level since Oct. 1,
according to the Energy Department.  “The drop in gasoline prices encouraged speculators to cut
long positions,” or bets on rising prices, said  Jerry Gidel , a
market analyst for North American Risk Management Services Inc.
in Chicago. “The market is concerned that the European debt
problems will slow the economic recovery in the U.S.”  Corn futures for March delivery fell 3.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $5.31 a bushel at 11:15 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the fourth drop in a week. The most-active futures lost
11 percent in the past two weeks after reaching a 26-month high
of $6.175 on Nov. 9.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $48.6 billion in
2009, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
