The proportion of Britons expecting
an increase in property rents rose in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier amid a shortage of homes,  Rightmove Plc  said.  Forty-two percent of 2,636 people surveyed last month said
rents will be higher 12 months from now, up from 37 percent in
the last three months of 2009, the London-based operator of
Britain’s biggest property website said in an e-mailed report
today. In the third quarter, 45 percent predicted higher rents.  A shortage of landlords buying property to let is limiting
the supply of rented accommodation and keeping rents high, the
report said. U.K. mortgage lending fell 9 percent from a year
earlier in October, and the level of loans is “too low,” the  Council of Mortgage Lenders  said last week.  Prospective tenants are “experiencing a struggle to find
suitable rental accommodation and losing out on properties to
higher bidders,”  Miles Shipside , director of Rightmove, said in
the report. “The momentum for further rises continues.”  Rightmove conducted the survey of people who are currently
renting and expect to be renting in a year from Oct. 4 to Oct.
