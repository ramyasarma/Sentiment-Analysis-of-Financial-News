China’s government will investigate
the practices of  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and 360.cn after a
dispute between the two Internet companies caused disruptions to
users and what a ministry called a “bad social impact.”  The operators must “stop attacks on each other” and
ensure their services are mutually compatible, the Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology said in a  Nov. 20 statement .
The regulator will investigate the behavior of Tencent and
360.cn, it said.  Tencent,  China’s biggest Internet company , asked users this
month to uninstall software made by 360.cn, saying the products
undermine information security. A product made by 360.cn will
disrupt the malware-detection features of Tencent’s QQ instant-
messaging service, Tencent said Nov. 3.  360.cn said its software is designed to stop QQ from
scanning data on users’ computers. Tencent says QQ has more than
600 million users, while 360.cn, a provider of free security
software, says it has a subscriber base of 300 million.  Tencent and 360.cn must apologize publicly for the dispute,
the ministry said. Tencent apologized in an e-mailed statement,
saying it “hadn’t fully taken into account the feelings of
users.” 360.cn is “sorry” about disruption suffered by users,
it said in a statement on its website.  Market Share  Tencent  rose  1 percent to HK$178 as of 10:55 a.m. in Hong
Kong trading, compared with a 0.6 percent decline in the city’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index. 360.cn, based in Beijing, is closely
held.  Traffic on the QQ service returned to “normal” levels,
Tencent President  Martin Lau  said Nov. 10. As many as 3 percent
of QQ subscribers may be affected by Tencent’s decision to ask
users to uninstall 360.cn’s software, according to estimates by
 Muzhi Li , an analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  QQ controlled 77 percent of China’s instant-messaging
market as of December 2009, according to Analysys International.
Microsoft Corp.’s MSN service had 4.2 percent market share, the
Beijing-based researcher said.  360.cn is the biggest provider of free security software in
China, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
