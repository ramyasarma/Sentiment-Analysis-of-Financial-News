Ivory Coast started deploying 4,000
troops across the country in advance of the country’s
presidential runoff vote set for Nov. 28, said Philippe Mangou,
head of the national army.  Half of the troops will be stationed in the north and half
in the south, including the main cocoa-growing regions, Mangou
said in an interview on state-owned RTI television yesterday.  Nicolas Kouakou, head of the joint security forces, said in
an interview today that the troops would consist of both
government soldiers and former rebels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
