A  Bank of America  Corp. employee who
said that Countrywide Financial Corp.’s policies were to retain
 mortgage  notes later clarified her testimony in a New Jersey
bankruptcy case, a lawyer for the company said.  “Countrywide’s policy and practice has been and remains to
fully comply with the pooling and servicing agreements,
including forwarding any necessary documents to the trustee,”
 Larry Platt , a lawyer at Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, said in an e-
mailed statement.   Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina,
acquired Countrywide in 2008.  “The associate whose testimony was cited in the ruling was
asked about a process outside her normal scope of
responsibilities and in an entirely different department from
where she worked,” Platt said.  “A review of her testimony shows she later clarified that
she was not comfortable testifying about the circumstances under
which original loan documents would move, or whether and to what
extent they ever are moved. This would include the initial
delivery of original loan documents to the trustee,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
