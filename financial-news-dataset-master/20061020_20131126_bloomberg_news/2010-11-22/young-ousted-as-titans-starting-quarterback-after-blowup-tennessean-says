Tennessee Titans quarterback  Vince Young  lost his starting job after injuring his thumb, throwing
his shoulder pads into the stands and storming out of the team’s
locker room, the Tennessean reported.  Young, who tore a flexor tendon in his thumb yesterday
during Tennessee’s 19-16 overtime loss to the Washington
Redskins, has lost his starting position to rookie  Rusty Smith 
regardless of the extent of the injury,  Tennessean.com  said,
citing the comments of Titans coach  Jeff Fisher .  After the game, Young threw his shoulder pads and jersey
into the stands while leaving the field and about 10 minutes
later walked out of the team’s locker room without talking to
the media as a teammate tried to get him to return, the
Tennessean said.  “Clearly, that’s no way to respond and so we have some
things we need to sort out with him,” Fisher said at a
 postgame news conference . “I’m very disappointed. I think his
teammates are disappointed. There’s going to be frustration in
losses. There are times when you really have to dig deep and
fight, and turn to one another. I don’t think you run.”  Young, 27, and Fisher have been at odds since the
quarterback refused to re-enter the 2008 season opener. After
 Kerry Collins  led the Titans to an 0-6 start last season, it was
team owner  Bud Adams ’s mandate that forced Fisher to start
Young, the Tennessean said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
