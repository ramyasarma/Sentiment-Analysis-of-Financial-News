Cattle futures fell after a
government report showed U.S. feedlots increased purchases of
young animals in October, signaling increased supplies for
meatpackers. Hogs were little changed.  Feedlots bought 2.504 million head of cattle last month, up
1.2 percent from October 2009, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said after Chicago markets closed on Nov. 19.
Fourteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast little
change, on average. The total feedlot herd was up 3.2 percent
from a year earlier, the USDA said.  “The cattle-on-feed feed report was mostly neutral and
maybe slightly bearish due to the increase in October
placements, and the overall increase in the cattle-on-feed
population,” said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures
Insights in Altus, Arkansas.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.425 cent, or
0.4 percent, to settle at $1.046 a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The commodity has climbed 21
percent this year.  The  dollar  rose for the first time in four sessions against
a basket of six major currencies, eroding the investment appeal
of some raw materials and demand for U.S. meat exports. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of 19 commodities declined
as much as 1.1 percent today. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
also dropped.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement were unchanged
at $1.174 a pound.  Hog futures for February settlement gained 0.075 cent to
settle at 76.925 cents a pound on the CME. Earlier, the price
reached 77.675, the highest level since Sept. 21. The commodity
has jumped 17 percent this year.  Tyson Foods Inc. , the largest U.S. meat processor, reported
fiscal fourth-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates
as pork sales rose 30 percent. Beef sales gained 1 percent, the
Springdale, Arkansas-based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
