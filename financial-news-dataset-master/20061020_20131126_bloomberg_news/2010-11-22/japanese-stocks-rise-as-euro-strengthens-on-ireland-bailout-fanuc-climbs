Japanese  stocks  advanced for a
fourth day after Ireland applied for a bailout to help fund
itself and save its banks, easing concern the nation’s debt
crisis will spread and strengthening the euro against the yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. , the world’s biggest carmaker, gained
1.1 percent. Kyocera Corp., an electronics maker that gets 18
percent of its sales in Europe, jumped 2.4 percent. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s largest oil-explorer, leapt 3.6 percent as oil prices
rose. Central Japan Railway Co., Japan’s No.1 high-speed train
operator, climbed 0.8 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said
the company will lead a bid for a railway project in Florida.  “Concerns about financial instability in Europe have eased
and a sense of security has spread on the rescue plan for
Ireland,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , a fund manager in Tokyo who
helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9 percent to 10,115.19
in Tokyo, the highest close since June 21 and the highest on a
dollar basis this year. The broader  Topix  index gained 0.7
percent to 875.48, a level not seen since June 24. About four
stocks increased for each one that decreased.  This year, the Nikkei has climbed about 6 percent to 121.27
in dollar terms while the gauge has lost 4.1 percent on a yen
basis. That compares with gains of 7.6 percent by the S&P 500
and 6.2 percent by the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index . Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 18 times estimated  earnings ,
compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 times for the
Stoxx 600.  Exporters Lead Gains  Toyota advanced 1.1 percent to 3,300 yen and was the most
actively traded stock in the Topix. Kyocera jumped 2.4 percent
to 8,570 yen and was the biggest support for the Nikkei’s gain.
 Canon Inc. , a camera maker that derives about 80 percent of its
revenue abroad, increased 1 percent to 4,050 yen. Sumco Corp., a
silicon wafer maker that gets 60 percent of its revenue outside
Japan, climbed 3.7 percent to 1,331 yen.  The yen depreciated to 114.85 against the euro, compared
with 113.65 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on Nov. 19.
Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 83.57 from
83.35. A weaker yen  boosts the value  of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said on Nov. 21 in Dublin
that he expects talks on the details of financial assistance
from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund for
Ireland to be completed in the “next few weeks.” Finance
Minister Brian Lenihan said the loan will be less than 100
billion euros ($137 billion). He declined to give further
details at a press conference in Dublin.  ‘Contagion Risk’  “A solution to Ireland’s problems helps reduce the
contagion risk with respect to other countries in Europe with
more immediate refinancing requirements,” said  Will Seddon , who
helps manage about $350 million at White Funds Management Pty.
in Sydney.  Inpex Corp., Japan’s largest oil-explorer, jumped 3.6
percent to 447,500 yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., an oil
driller, climbed 3.3 percent to 3,100 yen. The industry group
that includes the companies had the largest increase in the
Topix with a 3.5 percent gain.  Crude oil’s January contract rose as much as 0.8 percent to
$82.62 a barrel in electronic trading in New York today.  Central Japan Railway  climbed 0.8 percent to 640,000 yen.
Japan’s biggest high-speed train operator and a group of other
Japanese companies, including Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp.
plan to bid on a $2 billion high-speed rail project from Tampa
to Orlando, the Nikkei newspaper reported. Hitachi gained 1.8
percent to 404 yen and Toshiba increased 1.2 percent to 429 yen.  MS&AD Tumbles  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 0.5
percent today. In New York, the index advanced 0.3 percent on
Nov. 19 as higher-than-estimated profit at Dell Inc., the
world’s third-largest supplier of personal computers, and a
dividend increase at Nike Inc., the biggest maker of athletic
shoes, overshadowed concern China’s steps to slow inflation will
stifle global economic growth.  Among stocks that fell,  MS&AD Insurance Group  Holdings Inc.,
a casualty insurer, plunged 8.2 percent to 1,949 yen, the most
since January 2009, after the company reported a 30 percent drop
in first-half net income. Insurance companies declined the most
in the Topix.  “People seem to be disappointed as the company prioritized
costs and it did not generate higher profits,” Shinkin Asset
Management’s Fujiwara said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
