The euro may struggle to maintain
gains it made after Ireland applied to the European Union and
International Monetary Fund for financial assistance, according
to Royal Bank of Canada.  “The Irish bailout is not a euro panacea,”  Elsa Lignos , a
currency strategist at the bank in London, wrote in an e-mailed
report today. “We expect the euro to struggle on rallies,
despite progress on the bailout as fundamentals remain rocky.
Pressure is reduced for now, but we expect Portugal to require
assistance by February 2011 at the latest.”  Ireland became the second euro country to seek a rescue as
the cost of saving its banks threatened a rerun of the Greek
debt crisis that destabilized the common currency.  The euro advanced 0.1 percent to $1.3687 as of 12:14 p.m.
in London. It reached $1.3786 earlier today, the highest since
Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
