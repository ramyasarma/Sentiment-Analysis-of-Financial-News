AGL Energy Ltd. , an Australian
company seeking federal government funding to develop solar
power plants, said a proposed 100-megawatt venture in New South
Wales state would cost A$350 million ($347 million) to build.  AGL, the country’s largest electricity and gas retailer,
aims to develop as many as five projects using photo-voltaic
panels that convert sunlight into power, a filing with the New
South Wales planning department shows. The farms may have a
total capacity of 200 megawatts at multiple sites, AGL said.  The Australian government in May selected Sydney-based AGL,
TRUenergy Holdings Pty Ltd. and  BP Plc  to advance in a
competition for funding from a A$1.5 billion solar power
program. A joint proposal from China’s  Suntech Power Holdings
Co.  and Australia’s  Infigen Energy  was also shortlisted.  Australia, where coal accounts for more than 80 percent of
electricity production, has set a target of generating 20
percent of its power from wind, solar, geothermal and other
renewable energy sources by 2020. Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
in September set up a multi-party committee to study options for
introducing a price on carbon to help curb emissions.  The solar ventures proposed by AGL depend on the company
winning government funding, spokeswoman Karen Winsbury said in
an e-mail response to questions today. The 100-megawatt solar
project near Nyngan, northwest of Sydney, would generate more
than 150 construction jobs and take about 12 months to build,
AGL said.  The power producer  fell 0.3 percent  to A$15.71 at the 4:10
p.m. close in Sydney. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3
percent.  The  New South Wales  government on Nov. 18 set requirements
for AGL to meet before the power producer submits an
environmental assessment report, the documents show.  BP estimated a proposed 150-megawatt project in New South
Wales would cost more than A$600 million, the London-based
company said in documents filed with the planning department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
