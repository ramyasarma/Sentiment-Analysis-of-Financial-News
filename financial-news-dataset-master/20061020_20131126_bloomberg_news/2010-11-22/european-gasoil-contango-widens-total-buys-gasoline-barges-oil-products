Europe’s gasoil futures contango
widened, signaling weakening demand, after customers in Germany
filled up their heating fuel tanks ahead of winter.  BASF SE, the buyer of a 12,500-metric-ton naphtha cargo in
the last session, bought the same amount from Glencore
International AG. Gasoil futures for December delivery declined
on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Light Products  BASF  bought today’s naphtha cargo at $752 for delivery from
Dec. 13 to Dec. 17 to the port of Rotterdam, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. BASF bought a naphtha shipment from Vitol Group
on Nov. 19 for $763.50 a ton.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  purchased a 12,500-ton naphtha cargo
at $750 a ton from Gunvor International Ltd. That shipment is
for delivery from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6 to Rotterdam.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading  changed hands from
$743 a ton to $760 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and
Platts. That compares with deals on Nov. 19 from $741 to $769.  So-called barge lots are usually about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  The front-month  gasoline crack , or premium to Brent crude,
was $4.60 a barrel as of 5:02 p.m. London time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. data on Bloomberg. That compares with $4.25
a barrel on Nov. 19.  Premium gasoline traded at $748 a ton, little changed from
the last session.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for December delivery traded at a discount, or
contango, of $5.75 to the January contract on ICE. That compares
with $5.25 at the end of last week. Gasoil is the European
equivalent of heating oil.  A widening discount on the front-month contract can signal
a fall in demand or rise in  inventories . A market is in contango
when supplies for nearby delivery trade at a lower price than
shipments for later months.  Gasoil sales rose in Germany last month as consumers
stocked up for winter. Domestic heating oil tanks in Germany,
Europe’s biggest market, were 63 percent full at the end of last
month, compared with 56 percent at the end of January, according
to Credit Agricole CIB.  “Demand is down in the past week,” Jens Dammeyer, owner
of Helios Lubeoil KG, a fuel distributor in northern Germany,
said from Bremen. “Tanks are fuller.”  Gasoil futures for December dropped $4.25, or 0.6 percent,
to $701.25 a ton as of 5:03 p.m. local time. The gasoil
 crack  was little changed at $11.41 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News.  BP Plc , the buyer of two jet fuel cargoes last week, bought
on the barge market at a premium of $54 a ton to December ICE
gasoil. That’s little changed on deals at premiums of $53 and
$54 a ton at the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
