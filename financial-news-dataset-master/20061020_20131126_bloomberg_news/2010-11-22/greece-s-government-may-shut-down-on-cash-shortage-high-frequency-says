Parts of Greece’s government may be
forced to “shut down” as early as next week if the country
isn’t able to cover a revenue shortfall after its European Union
partners delayed its next tranche of aid money, High Frequency
Economics Ltd. said.  “With a big tax revenue shortfall, cash requirements are
surely greater than the 6.5 billion euros ($8.95 billion) Athens
was meant to receive next week,”  Carl B. Weinberg , chief
economist at Valhalla, New York-based High Frequency wrote in a
note to clients today.  “Unless the government gets funds soon after Nov. 30, it
will run out of cash,” Weinberg said. “If so, the government
will have to shut down, at least in part.”  Greek government bonds declined for a second day, with the
10-year yield increasing three basis points to 11.78 percent as
of 7:44 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
