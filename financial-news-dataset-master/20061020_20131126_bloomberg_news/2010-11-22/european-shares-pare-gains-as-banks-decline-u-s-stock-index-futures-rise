European stocks pared gains as banks
reversed an earlier advance and equities in the region’s weakest
economies declined. U.S. futures and Asia shares rose.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.1 percent to
269.83 at 11:11 a.m. in London after rallying as much as 0.8
percent earlier. Banco Santander SA led Spanish stocks lower,
falling 1.3 percent, while Lloyds Banking Group Plc lost 1.1
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
December rose 0.2 percent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
gained 0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
