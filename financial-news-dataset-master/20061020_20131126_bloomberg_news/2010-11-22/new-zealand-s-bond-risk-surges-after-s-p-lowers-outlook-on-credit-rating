New Zealand’s bond risk surged the
most in six months after Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook
on the nation’s foreign currency sovereign credit rating to
negative from stable.  Credit-default swaps on the South Pacific nation jumped 8
basis points to 62.5 basis points as of 4:23 p.m. in Wellington,
according to National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. That’s the
biggest increase since May 21 and the highest since Aug. 31,
prices from data provider CMA show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
