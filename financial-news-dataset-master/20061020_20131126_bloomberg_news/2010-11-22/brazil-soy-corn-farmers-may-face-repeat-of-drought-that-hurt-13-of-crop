Brazil  soybean  and  corn  farmers may
face a repeat of a 2005 drought that damaged 13 percent of the
grain and oilseed crop, a government weather forecaster said.  Since October, the South has received below-average rain
because of the La Nina weather pattern, raising concern crops
being planted now will be damaged before next year’s harvest,
said  Expedito Rebello , head of research at the government’s
Meteorology Institute, known as Inmet. The southern states of
Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul account for 41
percent of Brazil’s corn output and 37 percent of its soybeans.  In 2005, total grain and oilseed production fell to 113.5
million metric tons, compared with an initial forecast of as
much as 130.9 million tons, amid the worst drought in 40 years,
according to  Agriculture Ministry  data. Similar damage may occur
this year should dryness continue, according to Rebello.  “We’ve seen days with too much rain followed by long
periods of drought, which isn’t good for soybeans and corn,”
Rebello said in a telephone interview from Brasilia. “If
dryness continues in December, we may see the 2005 phenomenon
get repeated.”  Corn can’t tolerate more than 15 days without rain.
Soybeans can take about 30 days of dry weather, with possible
losses, he said. A better forecast on how the dry spell will
affect the harvest will be available by Dec. 15, he said.  Soybeans Rise  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 20 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $12.2150 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at
1:40 p.m. New York time. On Nov. 12, the oilseed reached
$13.485, the highest for a most-active contract since Aug. 28,
2008.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 5.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $5.2925 a bushel. On Nov. 9, the grain reached
$6.05, the highest for the contract since Aug. 29, 2008.  Soybean growers in Brazil, the world’s largest producer
after the U.S., will harvest between 67.7 million and 69 million
tons next year, compared with 68.7 million tons this year, the
Agriculture Ministry said on Nov. 10. Corn farmers will likely
reap 51.8 million to 52.7 million tons in 2011, down from 56
million this year, the ministry said.  Recent rains in the Brazilian Southeast, including the
states of Sao Paulo, Southern Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo,
which grow about 85 percent of the country’s coffee output, will
help the flowering of the nation’s coffee crop, Rebello said.  “The weather will help Brazil produce a good crop next
year,” he said.  Brazil may harvest 47.2 million bags of coffee this year,
compared with 39.5 million bags last year, the ministry said on
Sept. 9. The first estimate for next year’s coffee harvest will
be released in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
