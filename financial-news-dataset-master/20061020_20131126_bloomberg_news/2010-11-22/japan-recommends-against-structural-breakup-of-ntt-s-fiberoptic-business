Japan’s communications ministry said
it doesn’t support a “structural” breakup of  Nippon Telegraph
& Telephone Corp. ’s fiber-optic business after  Softbank Corp. 
called for such a separation.  The ministry recommends a “functional” separation of
 NTT ’s fiber-optic business instead, Japan’s Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications said in a statement today in Tokyo.
The government, which holds a 37 percent  stake  in NTT, cited
speed of deployment and costs, without giving further details.  Softbank has called for a breakup of NTT to encourage
adoption of broadband Internet access in Japan. NTT is counting
on the fiber-optic telephone and Internet access operations to
reduce its reliance on mobile-phone unit  NTT DoCoMo Inc. , which
contributes about 75 percent of profit. Softbank President
 Masayoshi Son  on Oct. 25 proposed creating a separate broadband
access company with 500 billion yen ($6 billion) in capital.  “Functional separation as a solution is ambiguous and
lacks specifics, without which it is likely to be ineffectual,”
Son told reporters after a briefing today in Tokyo. “Citizens
should be angry -- I know I am.”  NTT  rose 0.5 percent to 3,880 yen as of 12:53 p.m. in Tokyo
trading. Softbank climbed 0.6 percent, while the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1.3 percent.  The Japanese government announced plans in March to make
broadband accessible to all of the country’s households by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
