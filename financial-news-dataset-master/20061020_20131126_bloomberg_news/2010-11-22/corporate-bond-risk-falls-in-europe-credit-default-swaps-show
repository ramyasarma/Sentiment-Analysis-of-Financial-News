The cost of insuring against losses
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 8.75
basis points to 448, according to Markit Group Ltd. at 7:30 a.m.
in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and a decline signals improvement in
perceptions of credit quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 2 basis points to 99, Markit
prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($13.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
