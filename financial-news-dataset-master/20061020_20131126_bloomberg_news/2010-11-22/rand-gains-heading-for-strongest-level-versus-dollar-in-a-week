South Africa’s rand gained, heading
for its strongest level against the dollar in a week, as an
agreement to rescue Ireland’s banks eased contagion concern,
boosting investor demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy appreciated as
much as 0.8 percent and was trading 0.3 percent stronger at
6.9791 per dollar as of 11:25 a.m. in Johannesburg from a
previous close of 7.0021 on Nov. 19.  The euro and global stocks advanced for a fourth day after
Ireland applied for a bailout from the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund to help finance itself and save its
banks, the second common-currency nation after Greece requiring
a rescue package.  “Ireland’s agreement on the outlines of a bailout package
with the EU and IMF over the weekend removes some major
uncertainty over the euro,” currency analysts  John Cairns  and
Nema Ramkhelawan at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg wrote in
a report to clients today. “The euro-dollar rally” is
“creating some dollar-rand downside room,” they wrote.  South Africa’s central bank said today its leading economic
indicator of business trends six to 12 months ahead rose in
September to 131.9 from a revised 130.8 in August.  Bonds advanced, with the benchmark 13.5 percent security
due September 2015 adding 2 cents to 125.96 rand, reducing the
yield by 1 basis point to 7.037 percent.  Foreign investors were net sellers of 3.29 billion rand of
bonds on Nov. 19, taking the total sold last week to 4.26
billion rand, according to data compiled by JSE Ltd., which
manages the country’s exchanges.  “It could well be a large wave of profit-taking following
the Reserve Bank’s decision to cut 50 basis points on the policy
rates,”  Luis Costa , a director of emerging-markets strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in London, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients
dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
