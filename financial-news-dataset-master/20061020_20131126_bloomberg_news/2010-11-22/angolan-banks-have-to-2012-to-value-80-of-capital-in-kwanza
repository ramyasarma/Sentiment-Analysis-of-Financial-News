Angola’s commercial banks have
until 2012 to value 80 percent of their capital in the local
currency, the kwanza, as the central bank tries to reduce the
country’s dependency on the dollar.  The banks, which are currently allowed to have 100
percent of their capital in foreign currency, were informed
of the ruling on Nov. 10, said Jose de Lima Massano, governor
of the central bank. The new regulation was not announced
publicly.  The changes are part of a review of legislation that may
also include the introduction of factoring and leasing as
financial instruments, Massano said in an interview in the
capital, Luanda, on Nov. 19.  On Nov. 10, the central bank lowered its landmark
rediscount rate, the rate it charges commercial lenders to
borrow money, to 25 percent from 30 percent. Tackling
Angola’s annual inflation rate, which climbed to 16 percent
in October, is a “gigantic work” that will involve all the
government and not just the central bank, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
