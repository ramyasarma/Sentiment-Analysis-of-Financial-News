Pirates boarded a Russian oil tanker
off the coast of Nigeria, wounding a crewman with gunfire before
fleeing, the ship’s owner said.  Ten gunmen boarded the NS Spirit near the port of Lagos at
1:49 a.m. Moscow time and fled after the shooting, OAO Novoship,
a unit of state-run OAO Sovcomflot, said on its website today.  None of the other 21 members of the all-Russian crew  were
injured in the attack on the ship, which was carrying gasoline,
Novoship said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
