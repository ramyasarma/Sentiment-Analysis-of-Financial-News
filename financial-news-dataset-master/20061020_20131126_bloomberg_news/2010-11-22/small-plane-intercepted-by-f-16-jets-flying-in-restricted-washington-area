A small private plane flew into
restricted air space near Washington today and was escorted by
two F-16 fighter jets to a Virginia airport, according to a
military official.  Lieutenant Commander Bill Lewis of the  North American
Aerospace Defense  Command said a Cessna 182 was intercepted at
around 2:19 p.m. local time by two F-16 fighter jets dispatched
by NORAD from  Andrews Air Force Base .  The plane was escorted to an airport in Manassas, Virginia,
where it landed about 13 minutes later and was met by local law
enforcement officials. The U.S. Secret Service is questioning
the plane’s pilot, said Secret Service spokesman Max Milien.  NORAD works with homeland defense, security and law
enforcement agencies to protect U.S. and Canadian airspace from
unauthorized air activity.  The incident prompted the Secret Service to clear the north
grounds of the White House for about 45 minutes beginning around
2 p.m., said Milien. The Secret Service didn’t allow members of
the media or visitors in or out of the White House, where
President  Barack Obama  was at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
