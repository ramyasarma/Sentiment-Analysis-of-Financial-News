Bets on a silver rally by hedge-fund
managers and other large speculators dropped for the seventh
straight week after prices climbed to a 30-year high.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered shorts by 28,104 contracts in the week ended Nov. 16
on the Comex in New York, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Net-long positions fell by 4,479 futures
contracts, or 14 percent, from a week earlier. Seven weeks of
declines marks the longest slump since April 21, 2009.  Silver touched $29.34 an ounce on Nov. 9, the highest price
since March 1980, before dropping 15 percent over five sessions
to $24.98. The metal rose 61 percent this year before today as
investors sought an alternative to holding currencies.
Investment in the four exchange-traded products backed by silver
that Bloomberg News tracks has risen in the past three weeks,
touching a record 476,915,921 ounces on Nov. 17.  “Tactical traders have scaled back long exposure, while
ETP investors have increased their holdings,” analysts at
Barclays Capital said today in a report. “Tactical investors
mostly took profit in silver, as well as reducing short
positions.”  Silver futures for December delivery rose 17.6 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $27.355 at 9:50 a.m. on the Comex in New York.  Each Friday, the CFTC publishes aggregate numbers for long
and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors. Analysts and investors follow changes
in speculators’ positions because such transactions can reflect
an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
