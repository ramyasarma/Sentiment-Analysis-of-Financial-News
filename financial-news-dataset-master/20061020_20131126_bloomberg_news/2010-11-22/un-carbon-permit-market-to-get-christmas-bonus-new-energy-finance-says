The supply of new credits may jump
in the United Nation’s Clean Development Mechanism during the
week starting Dec. 13, Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast.  The supply of UN Certified Emission Reduction credits may
jump to 5.8 million metric tons that week, up from about 400,000
in the previous week, London-based analysts including Aimie
Parpia at New Energy Finance said today in an e-mailed report.  “The CER market will get a Christmas bonus,” potentially
widening the discount of UN credits compared with European Union
allowances, Parpia said. “Historically the CER-EUA spread has
been quite sensitive to issuance volumes. A large issuance
typically results in a widening of the CER-EUA spread.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
