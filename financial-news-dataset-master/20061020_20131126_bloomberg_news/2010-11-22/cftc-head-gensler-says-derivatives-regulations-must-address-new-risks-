Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
Chairman  Gary Gensler  said the agency’s new regulations for the
derivatives market must cover banks, non-banks and parts of the
financial system that “pose new risks.”  “We must oversee a banking system, shadow banking system,
derivatives marketplace and Wall Street,” Gensler said today in
remarks prepared for a conference at Princeton University in New
Jersey. “We don’t have the luxury to turn back the clock, but
we do have the responsibility to update our oversight for the
financial system of the time.”  The CFTC and the  Securities and Exchange Commission  are
leading U.S. efforts to draft regulations for the $583 trillion
over-the-counter derivatives market after largely unregulated
trading complicated efforts to resolve the 2008 credit crisis.
The new rules are required under the Dodd-Frank financial-
regulation law enacted in July.  Gensler’s agency is planning three meetings in December to
consider proposals for defining swaps dealers and other entities
in swaps markets, he said on Nov. 19. The CFTC has already held
five public meetings to consider and vote on proposed rules.  Derivatives, including swaps, are financial instruments
used to hedge risks or for speculation. They’re derived from
stocks, bonds, loans, currencies and commodities, or linked to
specific events like changes in the weather or interest rates.
Options and futures are the most common types of derivatives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
