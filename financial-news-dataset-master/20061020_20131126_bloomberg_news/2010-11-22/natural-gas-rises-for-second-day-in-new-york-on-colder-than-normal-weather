Natural gas futures rose to the
highest price in more than three months as the prospect of
below-normal temperatures signaled stronger demand for the
heating fuel.  Futures climbed 2.6 percent after forecasts showed the
weather will be colder than usual in the U.S. East and Midwest
from Nov. 27 to Dec. 5, according to the National Weather
Service. The gains came even after an Energy Department report
on Nov. 18 showed inventories increased to an all-time high in
the week ended Nov. 12.  “We are going to see the first real winter weather in this
country and it’s enough to get people buying natural gas,” said
 Carl Neill , an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in
Atlanta.  Natural gas for December delivery gained 10.7 cents to
$4.271 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement price since Aug. 13.
Gas has climbed 5.8 percent this month.  The December contract expires on Nov. 24. Gas for January
delivery advanced 10.8 cents to $4.432.  New York will have a low of 33 degrees Fahrenheit (1
Celsius) on Nov. 26, 5 degrees below average, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. Chicago will
have a low of 22 degrees, 8 degrees below normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas Rigs  The number of U.S. gas drilling rigs fell 19 last week to
936, the lowest level since March 12, according to Houston-based
Baker Hughes Inc.  “While not on a decisive downward trend, drilling is
showing signs of moderation,” said  Biliana Pehlivanova , an
analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, in a note. “Still, the
rig count remains at a level that ensures growth of production,
which keeps a lid on the upside potential for prices.”  Gas  inventories  gained 3 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 12 to a record 3.843 trillion cubic feet, according
to the Energy Department. Gas rallied 9.6 percent last week on
forecasts that temperatures will be below-normal in the East and
Midwest.  “Going into the heating season, you have adequate
supplies, and storage is having a dampening effect in the
market,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an analyst in Houston at
Canaccord Genuity. “Cold weather will be one of the factors
that can push gas out of a trading range, but we have to see
that come to fruition.”  Supply Report  The inventory increase was smaller than the five-year gain
of 18 billion cubic feet, Energy Department data showed. A
surplus to the five-year average narrowed to 9.3 percent from
9.8 percent.  Gas fell in earlier trading, following declines in stocks
and other commodities.  “You basically have pretty much all the other markets that
are falling, and that may be pressuring gas,” Neill said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.7 percent to
1,191.74 at 2:37 p.m. The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index  of
19 raw materials dropped 0.2 percent to 298.21.  Net-long  positions in futures and options combined in four
natural-gas contracts climbed for a third week, rising by
9,217.5 futures equivalents, or 20 percent, to 54,791.75 in the
week ended Nov. 16, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. It was the highest level since September.  The measure of net longs includes an index of four
contracts adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas
futures, Nymex Henry Hub Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate
Swaps and ICE Henry Hub Swaps.  Wholesale natural gas at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,
Louisiana, gained 22.6 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.0177 per
million Btu on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
270,311 as of 2:37 p.m., compared with a three-month average of
271,000. Volume was 294,668 on Nov. 19. Open interest was
760,685 contracts, compared with the three-month average of
806,000. The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting
open interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
