International Automotive Components
Group, the auto-parts supplier owned by billionaire  Wilbur Ross ,
acquired AMPRO Molding LLC, a maker of components for vehicle
interiors. Terms weren’t disclosed.  AMRPO, based in Anniston, Alabama, employs 150 people and
has a 157,000-square-foot factory on an 11-acre site, IAC said
in a statement. The company, which makes parts for consoles,
instrument panels and doors, is near IAC’s automaker customers
in the southeastern U.S. and has commercial and industrial
customers, IAC said in the statement.  “This acquisition of AMPRO is one additional and important
step in continuously aligning our global infrastructure to
support the needs of our customers,” Ross said in the
statement.  IAC, which runs its North American and Asian operations
from Dearborn, Michigan, took over assets of 12 insolvent
suppliers last year, adding more than $100 million in sales.
Ross had said in a Bloomberg interview in September that his
U.S. acquisitions were on pause while IAC digests those
purchases.  Ross has been hunting for acquisitions in China and India
for IAC’s interior-parts business, he said in the September
interview. Such acquisitions most likely would be less than
$500 million in size, he said.  IAC plans to move its headquarters to Southfield, Michigan,
next year, the company said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
