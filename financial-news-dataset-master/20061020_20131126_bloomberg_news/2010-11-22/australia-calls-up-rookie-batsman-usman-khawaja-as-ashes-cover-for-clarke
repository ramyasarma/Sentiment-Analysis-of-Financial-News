Australia added rookie batsman Usman
Khawaja to its squad for this week’s series-opening Ashes
cricket Test against England as backup for Michael Clarke , who
is recovering from a back injury.  Khawaja will join the 13-man roster in Brisbane as a
“standby player” for vice-captain Clarke, Cricket Australia
said in a statement.  Although Clarke didn’t practice today, Australian team
physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said he expected the middle-
order batsman to train tomorrow and Wednesday ahead of the first
Test starting in three days.  “We intend to give Michael as much time as possible to
prove his fitness and a decision on his availability will be
made in consultation with the team’s medical staff after the
next two days of training,” Australia’s chairman of selectors
 Andrew Hilditch  said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
