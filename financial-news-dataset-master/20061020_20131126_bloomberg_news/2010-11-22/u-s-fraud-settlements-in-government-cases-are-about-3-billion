The U.S. obtained about $3 billion
in settlements and judgments in cases involving fraud against
the government in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, a 25 percent
increase over the year before.  The amount of False Claims Act recoveries included the
largest ever health-care fraud recoveries, said Assistant
Attorney General  Tony West , head of the Justice Department’s
civil division, in a briefing today for reporters in Washington.  “We will hold you accountable whether you are a
corporation or an individual,” West told reporters. “The
numbers from this last fiscal year and for the last two years
show that that accountability comes at a high price.”  Most of the cases resulting in recovered funds were brought
to the government by whistleblowers, according to the Justice
Department. The act lets whistleblowers press fraud claims on
behalf of the federal government and then share in any recovery.  The U.S. recovered about $2.4 billion in the previous
fiscal year.  The Justice Department last year announced it was stepping
up efforts to fight health-care fraud by using a multi-agency
task force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
