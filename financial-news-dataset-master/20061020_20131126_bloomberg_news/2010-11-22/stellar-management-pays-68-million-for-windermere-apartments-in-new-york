Stellar Management , the owner-
manager of more than 24,000 apartments, bought the Windermere, a
374-unit building on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, for $68
million.  The building, at 666 West End Avenue, will get about $10
million in renovations, the New York-based firm said today in a
statement. New amenities will include wireless Internet, a lobby
lounge, a gym and a roof deck.  “Once renovations are complete, the property will
juxtapose the quintessential 1920s pre-war essence with modern
amenities,” Ryan Jackson, Stellar Management vice president,
said in the statement.  N-Plus Architecture and Design and RSVP Architecture Studio
will design the overhaul, Stellar Management said. The 23-story
Windermere had been owned by the Zarucki family since 1973, the
company said.  Stellar Management earlier this month said it bought Tivoli
Towers, a 320-unit, 33-story property in Brooklyn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
