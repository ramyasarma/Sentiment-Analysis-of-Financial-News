Turkey will not open its ports to
Greek Cypriot vessels and goods unless the European Union lifts
its trade embargo on Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus at the
same time, Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said.  “If there’s a simultaneous opening of ports and airports,
then we’ll be a part of it,” Erdogan said to reporters in
Ankara. “No one should expect anything different.”  Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south, which
is internationally recognized, and a Turkish-run north, which is
not, since Turkey invaded the Mediterranean island in 1974 after
a coup by supporters of a full union with Greece.  The north of the island is under an effective blockade by
the EU and most of the rest of the world, with direct flights
banned and almost all trade carried out via Turkey. The EU has
frozen some areas of Turkey’s membership negotiations because of
its refusal to recognize the Greek Cypriot government after
Cyprus joined the bloc in 2004.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
