Poland will study the possible
construction of a cross-border cable to import electricity from
Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave, where a nuclear power plant will
be built, Rzeczpospolita daily  reported  on its Rp.pl website.  The analysis will last for about a year, Rzeczpospolita
reported, quoting chief executive of Poland’s power grid
operator PSE-Operator Henryk Majchrzak.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marek Strzelecki in
