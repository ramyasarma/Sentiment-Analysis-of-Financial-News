The South African Reserve Bank’s
leading economic indicator, which signals business trends six to
12 months ahead, rose in September from the month before.  The indicator increased to 131.9 from a revised 130.8 in
August, the Pretoria-based bank said in a  statement  on its
website today.  The central bank cut interest rate for the third time this
year on Nov. 18, pushing the benchmark to 5.5 percent as a surge
in the value of the rand kept  inflation  in check. Growth in
Africa’s largest economy slowed to 3.2 percent in the second
quarter from 4.6 percent in the previous three months as mining
exports fell. The central bank expects the economy to expand 2.8
percent this year.  The leading indicator is derived from 12 sub-indexes,
including vehicle sales, business confidence, approved building
plans, commodity prices and job advertisements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
