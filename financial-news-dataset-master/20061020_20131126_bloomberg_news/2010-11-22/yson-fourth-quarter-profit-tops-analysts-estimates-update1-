Tyson Foods Inc. , the largest U.S.
meat processor, reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as pork sales gained.  Net income  of $213 million, or 57 cents a share, for the
three months ended Oct. 2 compared with a net loss of $457
million, or $1.23, a year earlier, Springdale, Arkansas-based
Tyson said today in a statement.  Earnings excluding goodwill impairment charges were 64
cents a share. That exceeded the 59-cent average of 10 analysts’
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey . Sales rose 3.1 percent to $7.44
billion from $7.21 billion.  Tyson, led by Chief Executive Officer  Donnie Smith , is
benefiting from tight pork supplies amid rising demand. Sales in
the pork unit, the company’s third-largest by revenue, rose 30
percent to $1.26 billion. Beef, Tyson biggest segment, gained 1
percent, and chicken sales fell 1.1 percent.  “Tyson has built one of the most efficient pork-processing
businesses in the country,”  Farha Aslam , an analyst for
Stephens Inc. in New York with an “overweight”  rating  on the
shares, said in a Nov. 15 report.  Tyson rose 96 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $16.60 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
increase since May 27.  The shares  have gained 35 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
