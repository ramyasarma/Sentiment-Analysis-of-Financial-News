Freddie Mac , the mortgage-finance
company under U.S. control, will boost fees it charges lenders
selling it riskier  home loans .  The changes, which take effect March 1, will raise some of
the upfront fees by as much 0.75 percent of loan balances and
add costs for consumers using additional home loans as part of
their borrowing, the McLean, Virginia-based company said today
in a  memo  posted on its website.  “The changes help to ensure that we are adequately
compensated for the continued provision of essential liquidity
to the mortgage market, and are able to continue our support for
affordable lending while being diligent stewards of taxpayer
funding,”  Patricia J. McClung , vice president of offerings
management at Freddie Mac, said in the memo.  The increased fees may add to challenges for the housing
market by raising borrowing costs. Lenders could offset an
upfront fee of 0.25 percent by raising the rate on a 30-year
loan by 0.05 percentage point, causing a rise of about $10 in
the monthly payments on a $200,000 loan, the company said.  Brad German , a spokesman, declined to comment further.  The new fees included a 0.25 percent charge for borrowers
with credit scores of more than 740 and loan-to-value ratios of
greater than 75 percent, according to the memo. Charges for
borrowers with scores below 660 rose to as much as 3.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
