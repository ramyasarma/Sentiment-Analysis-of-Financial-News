Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world’s
largest retailer, said it will match the price of competitors’
ads on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.  Weekend savings will begin with Thanksgiving Day online
specials on Nov. 25 and will run through Saturday, with cut-
price deals on electronics, home items and apparel, the company
said today in a statement. Customers with ads from competitors,
such as Target Corp. and Sears Holding Corp., will be able to
obtain those promotional prices at any Wal-Mart store.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is offering free
shipping to homes on almost 60,000 holiday items through its
website as it vies for budget-conscious shoppers. The offer
includes all electronics on sale during the holiday weekend and
the majority of products available for the Thanksgiving Day
online specials.  Wal-Mart  rose  41 cents to $54.39 on Nov. 19 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 1.8
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
