Gold rose to a one-week high on
speculation that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis may spread,
boosting the appeal of the precious metal as a haven. Silver
gained for the fourth straight session.  The euro fell against the dollar after Moody’s Investors
Service said it may lower Ireland’s credit rating by more than
one level. Gold has advanced 24 percent this year, reaching a
record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9.  “Because of the euro’s reaction to the bailout, a lot of
people are moving back into gold for safety,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services in
Chicago.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $5.50, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $1,357.80 at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,364.80, the highest since
Nov. 15. The metal declined 3.2 percent in the previous two
weeks.  Gold priced in euros rose to a record in June after a Greek
bailout.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 28.2 cents, or 1
percent, to $27.461 an ounce. The metal gained 7.7 percent in
the previous three sessions and is up 63 percent this year.  Gold’s rally was limited on signs that some investors are
locking in profit for the year. The metal headed for the 10th
straight annual gain.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 218,479 contracts on the Comex,
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading said on Nov. 19. Net-long
positions fell 27,700 contracts, or 11 percent, from a week
earlier, the biggest drop since mid-July.  ‘Big Players Liquidating’  Last week, bets on a rally by hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators dropped to the lowest since August, government
 data  show.  “A lot of big players are liquidating to book profit for
the year,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in
Chicago. “There’s not a lot of incentive here to be an
aggressive trader.”  Bets  on a silver rally declined for the seventh straight
week to the lowest since late February.  “During the commodity liquidation a week ago, large
investors withdrew money from precious-metals markets,” said
 Tom Pawlicki , an analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago.
“Liquidation may continue as fundamental support becomes
weaker.”  Palladium futures for December delivery fell $19, or 2.7
percent, to $684.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The price has surged 67 percent this year.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped $15.60, or
0.9 percent, to $1,655.50 an ounce. The metal has gained 13
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
