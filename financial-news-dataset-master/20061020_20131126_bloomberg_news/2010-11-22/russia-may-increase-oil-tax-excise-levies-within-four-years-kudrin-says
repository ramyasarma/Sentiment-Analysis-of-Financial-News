Russia may raise the mineral
extraction tax on oil and natural gas production, as well as
excise levies on alcohol and tobacco, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  said today in Moscow.  The government may also consider a real estate tax, Kudrin
said, without specifying what form the levy would take.  “These are appropriate and promising proposals,” Kudrin
said after meeting with the Delovaya Rossiya business lobby.
“Some of these changes may take effect in 2012, but in most
cases the changes would take two to three years to implement.”  Russia is seeking to boost revenue to eliminate the
government budget deficit by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
