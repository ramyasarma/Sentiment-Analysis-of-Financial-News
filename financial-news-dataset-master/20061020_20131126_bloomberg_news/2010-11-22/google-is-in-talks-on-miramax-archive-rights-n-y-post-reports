Google Inc. is in talks with
Filmyard Holdings LLC about obtaining digital rights to the
archives of the Miramax film studio, the New York Post reported,
citing unidentified people close to the matter.  Walt Disney Co. is negotiating a $664 million sale of
Miramax to Filmyard, which is funded partly by Colony Capital
LLC, a private-equity firm owned by construction entrepreneur
Tom Barrack, the newspaper said.  That transaction should be completed by Dec. 10, the Post
said. Asked about the Miramax talks, a Google spokesman said the
company doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation, the newspaper
added.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
