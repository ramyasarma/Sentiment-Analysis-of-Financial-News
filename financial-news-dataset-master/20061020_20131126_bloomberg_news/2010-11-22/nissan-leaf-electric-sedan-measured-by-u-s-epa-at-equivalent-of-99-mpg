Nissan Motor Co. ’s all-electric Leaf
compact car will have a window sticker that estimates its energy
consumption 99 miles per gallon equivalent in combined highway
and city driving, the company said in a statement.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the
Leaf, in kilowatts per hour, would use the same as 106 miles per
gallon of gasoline in city driving and 92 miles per gallon in
highway driving, Nissan said in a statement today.  “We’re pleased the label clearly demonstrates the Nissan
Leaf to be a best-in-class option,” said  Scott Becker , senior
vice president of finance and administration for Nissan in the
Americas. “The label provides consumers with a tool to compare
alternative-fuel vehicles to those with a traditional internal
combustion engine.”  Nissan will begin selling the Leaf in California, Oregon,
Washington, Arizona and Tennessee in December, according to the
statement. It will extend sales to Texas and Hawaii in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
