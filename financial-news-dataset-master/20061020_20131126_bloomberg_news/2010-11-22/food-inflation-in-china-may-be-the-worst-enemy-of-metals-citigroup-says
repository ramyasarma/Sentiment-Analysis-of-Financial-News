Accelerating food inflation in China
may be the “worst enemy” of metal prices because it will
encourage the government to increase interest rates, slowing
industrial production growth, Citigroup Inc. said in a report.  “When iron ore prices double, it hardly touches rural
Chinese workers,” Jon H. Bergtheil and other analysts wrote in
the report today. “When food prices rise 10-15 percent every
year, it does. For them, the ‘supper-cycle’ is a lot closer to
home than the ‘super-cycle’.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
