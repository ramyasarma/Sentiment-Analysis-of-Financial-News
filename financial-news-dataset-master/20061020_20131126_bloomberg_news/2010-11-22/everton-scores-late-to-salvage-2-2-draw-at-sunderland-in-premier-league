Mikel Arteta  scored in the 83rd
minute to earn Everton a 2-2 draw at Sunderland in English
soccer’s Premier League.  Two  Danny Welbeck  goals had put Sunderland 2-1 up at the
Stadium of Light after  Tim Cahill ’s sixth-minute headed opener.
With seven minutes remaining, Arteta’s left-foot shot deflected
off defender  Phil Bardlsey  and past goalkeeper  Craig Gordon .  Sunderland, which last week won 3-0 at defending champion
Chelsea, remains in seventh place in the 20-team standings with
20 points. Everton climbs two spots to 14th, ahead of Birmingham
on goal difference.  Welbeck and Everton’s Jermaine Beckford both missed chances
to win the game in stoppage time. Welbeck shot wide of the post
from near the penalty spot before Beckford fired over the
crossbar moments later with just the goalkeeper to beat.  Sunderland remains one of three Premier League clubs
unbeaten at home this season along with Aston Villa and second-
place Manchester United, which trails leader Chelsea on goal
difference with both teams on 28 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
