Sazaby League Ltd.  surged the most
in 13 years Japan’s Jasdaq market after a management-led group
offered a 45 percent premium to buy the handbag designer and
coffee-shop operator and take it private.  Sazaby  rose 22 percent to 1,682 yen at 11 a.m. in Tokyo,
the most since it started trading in 1997. AHA, an investment
company owned by Sazaby executive Ryota Tsunoda, offered 2,000
yen a share for the part owner of  Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. ,
45 percent more than the Nov. 19 closing price of 1,382 yen.  “Intuitively speaking, the privatization of Sazaby will
have no impact on Starbucks,” said  Naozumi Nishimura , an
analyst at Toward the Infinite World Inc. in Tokyo.  Sazaby plans to keep its stake in  Starbucks Coffee Japan ,
Masami Iura, a spokesman for the company, said by phone today.
“There are no changes to our position on  Starbucks’ stock ,”
Iura said.  Sazaby  owned 39.89 percent of  Starbucks Japan , a
joint venture with the world’s largest operator of coffee shops,
as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Starbucks Coffee Japan spokesman Yasunori Okamoto declined
to comment. The company’s  stock  rose 0.4 percent to 42,150 yen.  “It’s very unlikely Sazaby will sell the stake in
Starbucks,” Nishimura said.  Sazaby said  operating income  doubled to 1.27 billion yen
($15.2 million) in the six months ended September and forecast
it to grow 33 percent to 4.2 billion yen in the year ending
March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
