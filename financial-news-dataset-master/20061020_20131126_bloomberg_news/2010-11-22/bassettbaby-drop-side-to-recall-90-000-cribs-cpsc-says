Bassett Furniture Industries Inc. 
recalled about 90,000 drop-side cribs after reports of at least
154 incidents of failed hardware, the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission said in a statement.  Bassett Furniture of Bassett, Virginia, sold the cribs
nationwide from January 2000 through August 2010 for $200 to
$500, the CPSC said. The Bassettbaby brand is sold on the
Internet and by retailers such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ,  Target
Corp.  and Babies ‘R’ Us, a part of  Toys ‘R’ Us Inc. , according
to the company’s  website .  In one of 18 incidents in which drop-side gates
malfunctioned or detached, a child became entrapped between the
mattress and the crib’s frame, the CPSC said. Three children
fell out. None of the accidents caused injuries, the agency
said.  The agency is seeking to educate parents on common risks
that led to deaths and injuries involving drop-side cribs. The
CPSC is collaborating with the American Academy of Pediatrics
and New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital to
distribute videos at hospitals and doctors’ offices showing
risks of strangulation and entrapment.  In May, CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum said drop-side cribs
are a “deadly hazard,” and said the agency has verified at
least 32 deaths in the models since January 2000. New crib
requirements proposed in July will ban the design.  To contact the reporter on this story:
