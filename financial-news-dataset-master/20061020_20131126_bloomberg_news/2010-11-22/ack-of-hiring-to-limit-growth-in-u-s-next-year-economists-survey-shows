The economy in the U.S. will fail to
strengthen in 2011 as companies limit hiring and consumers curb
spending, a survey showed.  Gross domestic product will increase 2.6 percent next year
after growing 2.7 percent in 2010, according to the median
forecast of 51 economists surveyed by the  National Association
for Business Economics  from Oct. 21 to Nov. 4.  “Growth is expected to be moderate,”  Richard Wobbekind ,
president of the group and associate dean of the Leeds School of
Business at the University of Colorado-Boulder, said in a
statement. “Panelists remain concerned about high levels of
federal debt, a continuing high level of unemployment, increased
business regulation and rising commodity prices.”  A diminishing need to replenish  inventories , the winding
down of government stimulus and households’ drive to  pay off 
debt will restrain growth, the survey showed. The economists
polled said the world’s largest economy will add fewer jobs than
they predicted last month.  Employment next year will climb by 136,000 a month on
average, down from the 153,000 they projected in October, the
survey showed. This month’s canvass was completed before the
Labor Department reported on Nov. 5 that employers added 151,000
workers to payrolls last month, beating the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The  unemployment rate  will be 9.4 percent or higher through
the middle of 2011 before dropping to 9.2 percent by the end of
next year, according to economists surveyed.  Consumer spending will expand 1.7 percent in 2010 and 2.4
percent in 2011, the survey showed. Median projections in
October for this year and next were 1.5 percent and 2.3 percent,
respectively.  Inflation Forecast  Respondents also said inflation in 2011 will remain below
the Federal Reserve’s estimates. Economists forecast the central
bank’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption
expenditures price index excluding food and energy, will rise
1.3 percent next year after a 1.1 percent gain in 2010. Fed
policy makers have a long-run inflation forecast of 1.7 percent
to 2 percent, the level they see as consistent with achieving
legislative mandates for maximum employment and stable prices.  About one-third of those surveyed said a Fed decision to
buy more Treasury securities could diminish the risk of
deflation, and another third said the action could increase the
risk of “undesirable” inflation. Policy makers on Nov. 3
announced a plan to buy another $600 billion in government debt
through June.  The Fed’s so-called quantitative easing program will not
prevent borrowing costs from rising, the survey showed. The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note will increase every quarter
next year, finishing at 3.25 percent by the end of 2011. The
yield at the end of the third quarter this year was 2.51
percent.  The biggest threat to the economy was “excessive federal
debt,” according to those surveyed, exceeding concern over
unemployment and either inflation or deflation, the report said.  The U.S. deficit will narrow to $1.1 trillion in 2011 from
$1.3 trillion this year, according to the median forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
