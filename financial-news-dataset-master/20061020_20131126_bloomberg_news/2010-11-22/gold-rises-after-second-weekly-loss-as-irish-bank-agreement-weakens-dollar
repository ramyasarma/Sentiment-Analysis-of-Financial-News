Gold may climb in New York on
speculation a deal to rescue Ireland’s banks will curb a spread
of the debt crisis and help weaken the dollar.  The euro earlier gained for a fourth day against the dollar
after European Union finance ministers said the deal will create
a capital fund for Ireland’s lenders. Gold, which reached a
record $1,424.30 an ounce on Nov. 9, usually moves inversely to
the greenback, which was last little changed. Bullion fell 1
percent last week as moves by China to fight inflation and slow
growth eroded demand for precious metals and raw materials.  “Investors are really expecting the Ireland situation is
going to improve, which will help the euro,”  Peter Fertig ,
owner of Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in Hainburg,
Germany, said today by phone. “A weaker dollar is positive for
gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery added $2.90, or 0.2
percent, to $1,355.20 an ounce at 8:01 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.3 percent
higher at $1,356.50.  Bullion rose to $1,357.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,342.50 at the afternoon fixing on Nov. 19.  Ireland’s request for a bailout makes it the second euro
member to seek a rescue from the EU and the International
Monetary Fund, following Greece. The European Central Bank said
in a statement yesterday that it is “confident” the program
will help ensure the stability of the nation’s banking system.
Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  said yesterday he expects talks
on the package to be completed in the “next few weeks.”  China Measures  “The Irish problem is not fixed yet, but the agreement
appears to be a relief for the time being,” said  Hwang Il Doo ,
a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. “I
guess bullion might have bottomed out and could head north
toward the end of the year.”  China last week ordered banks to set aside larger reserves
for the fifth time this year. The country is the biggest bullion
consumer after India.  Gold assets  in exchange-traded products rose 4.9 metric
tons to 2,087.54 tons on Nov. 19, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 10 providers. Holdings reached a record 2,104.65
tons on Oct. 14.  Silver for December delivery in New York gained 1 percent
to $27.445 an ounce. It reached a 30-year high of $29.34 on Nov.
9 and is up 63 percent this year. Silver-coin sales will climb
as investors seek to protect their wealth from weakening
currencies, according to the Perth Mint, producer of about 6
percent of the world’s gold bullion.  Palladium for December delivery lost 0.2 percent to $702.05
an ounce. Platinum for January delivery was 0.6 percent lower at
$1,660.80 an ounce. Holdings of the metal in three ETPs tracked
by Bloomberg gained 0.79 tons to 34.7 tons on Nov. 19, the
highest amount since at least February, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
