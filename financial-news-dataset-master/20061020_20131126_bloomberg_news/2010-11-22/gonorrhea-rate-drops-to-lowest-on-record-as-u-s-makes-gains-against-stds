Gonorrhea  fell last year to the
lowest rate ever recorded in the U.S., according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Gonorrhea cases reported to health authorities in the U.S.
totaled 301,174 in 2009, the Atlanta-based health agency said
today in a report. That meant there were 99 cases for every
100,000 people, a rate 10 percent lower than in 2008. For the
first time in five years, syphilis didn’t increase among women
overall, researchers found.  The data show headway in the nation’s battle against
sexually transmitted diseases, which cost the health-care system
an estimated $16.4 billion annually, the CDC said in a
statement. There are about 19 million new  STD infections  every
year in the U.S., including those such as human papillomavirus
and herpes that aren’t reported to the CDC, according to
researchers. Each year, at least 24,000 women become infertile
because of untreated sexual diseases, the CDC said.  “We’re very excited, as we see some signs of progress,”
said Charlotte Kent, the acting director of the CDC’s Division
of STD Prevention. “We care about these as they’re preventable
causes of infertility.”  The number of chlamydia cases rose 2.8 percent from the
previous year, probably reflecting increased screening,
according to the report.  Syphilis  increased overall by 5 percent
to 13,997 cases.  STD rates were higher in blacks, who accounted for 71
percent of the gonorrhea cases in 2009, and about half of the
chlamydia and syphilis cases, the CDC said. Blacks represented
14 percent of the U.S. population, according to the report.  Regardless of race or gender, sexually active people under
25 were more likely to have sexually transmitted diseases, the
report found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
