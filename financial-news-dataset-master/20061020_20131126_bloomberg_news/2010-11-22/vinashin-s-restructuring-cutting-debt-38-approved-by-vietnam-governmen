Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group,
restructuring after overexpansion led to near-collapse, won
government approval for a turnaround that includes paring debt
38 percent and transferring units to other state-owned companies.  Vinashin’s debts will fall to 53 trillion dong ($2.7
billion) under the plan, which ministries will work on through
2013, the government said in a Nov. 19 statement on its  website .
The shipyard’s debts totaled 86 trillion dong in June.  Vietnam National Shipping Lines also will take over orders
for 20 ships that Vinashin customers had canceled to help the
yard maintain production, according to a separate Nov. 19
statement. The government has arrested at least five people,
including Vinashin’s ex-chairman, as it investigates financial
difficulties at the shipyard that followed the global recession
and expansion into areas ranging from securities to tourism.  The shipyard plans to cut its number of units to 43 from
259 under the restructuring plan, according to the statement on
debt. Assets will drop to 68 trillion dong from 104 trillion
dong as of June. The government said previously that some assets
will be transferred to state-controlled Vinalines and Vietnam
Oil & Gas Group.  Vinashin plans to deliver 57 vessels, worth about $573
million, this year, according to the debt statement. It had
completed 36 ships, valued at $280.6 million, by Nov. 18.  The shipbuilder “was facing the risk of bankruptcy” in
June, according to an Aug. 4 government statement.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
