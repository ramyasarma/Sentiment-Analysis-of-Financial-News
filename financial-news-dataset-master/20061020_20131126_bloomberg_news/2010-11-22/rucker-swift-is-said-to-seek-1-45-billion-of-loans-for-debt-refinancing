Swift Corp. , the largest truckload
carrier in North America, is seeking $1.45 billion of loans to
fund a tender offer as part of a debt refinancing, according to
a person familiar with the negotiations.  Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co.
will arrange a $400 million revolving credit line due in five
years and a $1.05 billion term loan maturing in six years, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. The banks will hold a lender meeting Nov. 30.  The company will use the loans and about $1 billion from an
initial public offering to refinance $2.53 billion of total
debt, Swift said in a Nov. 8 regulatory filing. The company’s
Swift Transportation Co. LLC unit initiated a tender offer to
buy back $709.2 million of notes maturing in 2015 and 2017,
Phoenix-based Swift said in a Nov. 19 statement.  Chief Financial Officer  Virginia Henkels  didn’t immediately
return a message left at her office.  Swift got a $1.72 billion term loan in May 2007 as part of
the company’s takeover by founder  Jerry Moyes , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company owes $1.49 billion on the
first-lien borrowing.  The debt due 2014 has an interest rate 5.75 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg
data show. Libor, the rate banks charge to lend to each other,
has a 2.25 percent floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
