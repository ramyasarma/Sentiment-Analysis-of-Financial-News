Public opinions expressed on the
Internet in China are influencing the nation’s government and
making decisions more democratic and objective, the China Daily
reported today, citing a report by Shanghai Jiao Tong
University.  Government officials are also being forced to be more
cautious of their behavior and speeches as a number of clumsy or
rude remarks have been exposed by the internet, the newspaper
reported, citing Xie Yungeng, deputy director of the
university’s Institute of Arts and Humanities and also head of
the research project that produced the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
