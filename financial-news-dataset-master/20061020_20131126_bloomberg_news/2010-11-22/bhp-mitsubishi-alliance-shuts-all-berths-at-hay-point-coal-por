BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
biggest mining company, said rain has affected coal mining
operations and high winds and seas have disrupted loading at its
terminal at Hay Point port in Australia’s Queensland state.  “Shipping impacts are being assessed,” BHP Billiton Ltd.
spokeswoman,  Fiona Martin , said in an e-mailed statement. The
two berths at the terminal have been  closed  until further notice
because of “adverse weather,” Inchcape Shipping Services Pty,
which arranges ship dockings, reported on its website.  Hay Point port, the world’s biggest export harbor for coal,
is about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) north of Brisbane and has
two terminals with the capacity to export 129 million tons a
year. Rain across Queensland’s Bowen Basin during the past five
days has affected some mines BHP operates in separate alliances
with Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsui & Co. Ltd., Martin said.  “Conditions are being assessed and full operations are
being resumed as and when it is safe to do so,” Melbourne-based
Martin said. The BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance, or BMA as
it’s known, is the world’s biggest exporter of coal for
steelmaking and operates  seven mines  in the Bowen Basin.  BMA’s terminal at Hay Point has the capacity to export 44
million tons a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
