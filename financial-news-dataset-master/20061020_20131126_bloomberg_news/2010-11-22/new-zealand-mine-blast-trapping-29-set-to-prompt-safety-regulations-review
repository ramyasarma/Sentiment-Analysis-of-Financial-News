A gas explosion at the  Pike River
Coal Co.  mine in New Zealand that’s trapped 29 men underground
is set to prompt a review and possible changes to mine safety
legislation for the nation’s resources industry.  “Any major incident certainly, more often than not, leads
to a major review,” said Bruce Hebblewhite, head of the
University of New South Wales’s school of mining and engineering
in Sydney. “It’s highly likely there’d be some sort of major
investigation or review.”  No contact has been made with the men since the explosion
cut communication at about 3:50 p.m. local time on Nov. 19 at
the mine about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Greymouth on
the West Coast of the nation’s South Island. New Zealand, which
has an estimated 15 billion metric tons of coal reserves,
exports to India and Japan as well as the U.S. and China.  “In highly legislated countries such as New Zealand or
Australia, particularly if there were to be a fatality, there
would be a broad safety review after such an incident,” said
 Andrew Harrington , a research analyst at Patersons Securities
Ltd. in Sydney who has visited the mine.  Pike River’s Sydney-traded shares  slumped  14 percent to 61
cents on Nov. 19 before trading was halted. The company fell 4.4
percent to 88 New Zealand cents by the Wellington close on the
same day. The stock was suspended on both stock exchanges
yesterday. New Zealand Oil & Gas Ltd., Pike River’s largest
shareholder with 29 percent, is also halted.  Prime Minister  New Zealand Prime Minister  John Key  yesterday told
reporters in Greymouth there will be a “series of inquiries”
into the cause of the blast. Key visited the mine site to meet
rescue workers and families.  Pike River’s Chief Executive Officer  Peter Whittall 
wouldn’t comment yesterday on the mine’s future. The company
didn’t know the cause of the explosion or the extent of any
damage, he told reporters.  Pike River is part-owned by India’s  Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd. 
and Saurashtra Fuels Pvt. The mine was forecast to produce
320,000 to 360,000 metric tons of coal in the year through June,
the company said Oct. 19. That almost halved an April forecast
because of equipment and road construction delays.  New Zealand’s West Coast has 13 coal mines, including four
underground operations, according to the Ministry of Economic
Development’s web site. Mining employs about 6,000 people,
according to the government website www.beehive.govt.nz. The
industry earned about NZ$1.1 billion ($850 million) in export
receipts in 2009.  ‘Significant Reviews’  Two gas explosions in mines in the Moura district of
Australia’s Queensland state in 1986 and 1994, which killed 12
and 11 miners respectively, led to improved monitoring of gas
levels and emergency response procedures, Hebblewhite said.  “They both led to significant reviews of mining practices,
of legislation, of training,” he said.  Rescuers at Pike River last night were preparing to deploy
cameras and laser imaging gear through a 160-meter hole being
drilled into the mine to test air quality.  Samples taken at the mine’s main ventilation shaft still
showed high levels of carbon dioxide and methane, preventing
rescuers from entering the mine.  Coal provides 13 percent of New Zealand’s primary energy,
according to the ministry. Neighboring Australia, the world’s
biggest coal exporter, shipped almost A$55 billion ($54 billion)
of the fuel in fiscal 2009, according to government data.  Rock Fall  Pike River began construction of the mine in September 2006
and exported its first coal in February this year, a year late
after problems with equipment and a rock fall in a ventilation
shaft in February 2009.  New Zealand operates 21 coal mines, producing 4.5 million
tons, with the West Coast the largest producing region at 2.2
million tons, according to the ministry. Closely held Solid
Energy New Zealand Ltd. produces about 85 percent of the
nation’s coal, while Sydney-traded  Bathurst Resources Ltd.  plans
to mine about 2 million tons of coal from the Buller field by
the end of 2013, the company said on its website.  The Pike River blast has stirred memories of a gas
explosion at the Strongman mine in 1967 in the West Coast region
that killed 19 men.  Asked if mining should be stopped in the area, New
Zealand’s Key said the causes of the explosions at Pike River
weren’t yet known, while mining practices since the Strongman
incident had evolved.  “We will need to ask ourselves some tough questions and we
will do that in due course,” he said. Now is not that time, he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
