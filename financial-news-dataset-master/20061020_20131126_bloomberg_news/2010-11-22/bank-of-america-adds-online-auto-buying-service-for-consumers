Bank of America Corp. , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, set up an online service that lets
customers apply for loans and shop for new and used cars and
trucks.  Bank of America’s network of more than 4,000 auto dealers
will list their inventory on the  website , which uses a platform
developed by TrueCar Inc., according to a statement by the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank.  TrueCar, an online vehicle-pricing provider based in Santa
Monica, California, has network-sharing agreements with other
lenders including  Capital One Financial Corp.  and shopping
websites such as those run by  EBay Inc.  and Overstock.com Inc.,
said  Chintan Talati , a spokesman.  Dealers using TrueCar’s network, called Zag, sold more than
100,000 new cars this year though Nov. 12, Talati said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
