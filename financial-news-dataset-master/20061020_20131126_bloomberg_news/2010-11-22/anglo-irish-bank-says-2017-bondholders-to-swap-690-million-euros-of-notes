Anglo Irish Bank Corp.  said holders
of 690 million euros ($950 million) of its 2017 subordinated
bonds agreed to swap their debt for new notes at an 80 percent
discount as the government spreads the burden of the banking
crisis.  Investors with 92 percent of the 750 million euros of
outstanding bonds will now receive 136.8 million euros of one-
year government-guaranteed securities paying 375 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate, Anglo Irish said in a
statement today. The discount allows the nationalized bank to
generate a gain that can be used to bolster its capital ratios.  Ireland was forced to turn to the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  for a bailout because of losses
racked up by its banks after a decade-long property bubble
imploded. Anglo Irish will absorb about 34 billion euros of new
capital to make up for bad loans, while other lenders will
increase the total to as much as 54 billion euros, the
government said in September.  “Sub debt is at risk whenever the government is
significantly involved in the capital structure of a bank,”
said  Eleonore Lamberty , an analyst at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam.
“There will be a read-across for all Irish banks.”  Subordinated bonds of lenders including Bank of Ireland
Plc, the nation’s largest bank, declined.  Bank of Ireland  Bank of Ireland’s 1 billion euros of 10 percent notes due
2020 fell 3.25 cents on the euro to a record 63 cents, according
to BNP Paribas SA prices on Bloomberg. The Dublin-based
company’s 248 million euros of floating-rate notes due 2017
declined 1 cent to 53 cents, BNP Paribas prices show.  Junior debt of Allied Irish Banks Plc, in which the
government holds more than 90 percent and which must raise 10.4
billion euros of new capital by year-end, also fell. The
lender’s 368 million pounds ($592 million) of 12.5 percent
subordinated bonds due 2019 dropped 3 cents to 40 cents.  Anglo Irish bondholders will vote tomorrow to allow the
bank to buy back notes that weren’t tendered at 1 cent per
1,000-euro face value, according to the statement. Holders
agreeing to the exchange will be deemed to support the proposal.  The agreement may trigger credit-default swaps insuring
Anglo Irish debt, according to Barclays Capital. These contracts
pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying
securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to
adhere to its debt agreements.  The cost of insuring Allied Irish senior bonds fell, with
credit-default swaps dropping 79.5 basis points to 796.5, while
contracts protecting subordinated notes were little changed at
56 percent upfront and 5 percent a year, according to CMA.  A total 683 contracts insuring $372.8 million of Anglo
Irish’s senior and subordinated debt were outstanding on Nov.
12, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., which
runs a central registry for the market. Under the terms of the
contracts, holders of swaps linked to both senior and
subordinated debt can demand payment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
