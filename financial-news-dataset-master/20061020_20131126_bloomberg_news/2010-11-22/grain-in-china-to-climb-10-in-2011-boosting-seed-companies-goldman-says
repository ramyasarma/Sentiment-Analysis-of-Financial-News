China’s grain prices will “rise
steadily” at about 10 percent next year, benefiting the
nation’s seed and fertilizer companies, according to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.  The brokerage initiated coverage of Gansu Dunhuang Seed Co.
and Shandong Denghai Seeds Co. with “neutral” ratings and
started coverage of Hefei Fengle Seed Co. and Yuan Longping
High-tech Agriculture Co. with “sell” recommendations,
according to a report by Jessie Pinglun Lai and Chris Shiu. They
raised the ratings of Lianhe Chemical Technology Co. and Qinghai
Salt Lake Potash Co. to “buy” from “neutral” and increased
Lier Chemical Co., Qinghai Salt Lake Industry Group Co. and
Shenzhen Noposion Agrochemicals Co. to “neutral” from
“sell.”  Yunnan Yuntianhua Co. was lowered to “sell” from
“neutral,” according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
