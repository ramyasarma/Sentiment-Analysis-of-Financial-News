The Colorado Rapids won their first
Major League Soccer championship with a 2-1 overtime victory
against FC Dallas at the  MLS Cup  in Toronto.  Colorado was seeded  seventh  out of eight teams that made
the MLS playoffs after going 12-8-10 during the regular season.  The Rapids fell behind 1-0 in the 35th minute last night on
a goal by MLS Most Valuable Player David Ferreira of FC Dallas,
which was playing in the league final for the first time. Conor
Casey tied it in the 57th minute for Colorado.  The  winning goal  came three minutes into the second half of
extra time, when Macoumba Kandji beat a defender and hit a shot
from a sharp angle that deflected into the net off FC Dallas
defender George John.  To contact the reporter on this story:
