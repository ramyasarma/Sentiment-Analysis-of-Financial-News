Barclays Plc  got two transfers
totaling about $1.3 billion from  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
in September 2008 that may have violated securities laws, the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said.  The U.K. bank got $769 million in securities held in the
Lehman brokerage’s reserve bank account, and $507 million in
assets listed as a debit item in the brokerage’s customer
reserve, when it bought defunct Lehman’s brokerage,  Lehman
Brothers Inc. , the SEC said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  The transfers would violate securities law if they
increased the deficiency in the accounts, “and LBI would not
have sufficient funds to satisfy all claims of the remaining
customers,” the SEC said.  The SEC’s filing comes amid a bankruptcy court trial of
Barclays, which is accused by Lehman of making an $11 billion
“windfall” on its purchase of the brokerage.  “The sale transaction that was disclosed to the court was
based upon false premises from the very outset,” Lehman’s
lawyer,  Robert Gaffey , told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James in a
court filing yesterday that is his last chance to sway the
judge.  Peck may rule on Lehman’s yearlong lawsuit against Barclays
in January or February, said lawyers in the case.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
