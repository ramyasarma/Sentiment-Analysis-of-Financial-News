Tesco Plc , the U.K.’s largest
retailer, plans to quadruple its sales in China over the next
five years as it increases the number of stores in the world’s
fastest-growing major economy.  Tesco, based in Cheshunt, England, aims to have annual
revenues of 4 billion pounds ($6.4 billion) from China by 2015,
 Zhuang Nanbin , a company spokesman in Shanghai, said in an e-
mail today. The retailer plans to operate more than 200
hyperstores in China in five years, compared with 88 now,
according to the e-mail.  Sales in China rose 8.3 percent in the nine weeks through
Oct. 31, the company said in presentation slides published on
its website yesterday.  Retailers including Tesco and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are
expanding operations in China as incomes rise and the government
promotes consumer spending. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest
retailer, will increase its investment in China, Chairman  S. Robson Walton  said Nov. 17, according to Xinhua News Agency.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
