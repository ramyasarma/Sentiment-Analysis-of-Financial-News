Palladium, gold and silver will
extend their rallies next year and investors should remain
overweight in precious metals, which will outperform farm
products including sugar, according to Societe Generale SA.  Gold may gain 11 percent within a year, benefitting from
central banks’ stimulus packages and expected dollar weakness,
 Frederic Lasserre , head of commodities research, said today at a
media briefing. Palladium may rise 21 percent and silver may
climb 19 percent, Lasserre said in Singapore.  Gold has surged to a record this month as investors seek
alternatives to declining currencies and as concerns mount about
the stability of some debt-laden economies. Ireland became the
latest euro country to apply for a bailout from the European
Union and International Monetary Fund at the weekend.  “We might see some gold-price rally again because of the
recent fears regarding sovereign debt, and also the impact it
may have on the dollar-euro,” Lasserre said. Corn and wheat
will gain about 1 percent over the next 12 months, while raw
sugar may drop 33 percent, according to bank forecasts, which
projected changes from this quarter to the final quarter of 2011.  Spot gold, which traded at record $1,424.60 an ounce Nov. 9,
has advanced 24 percent this year. Palladium, trading today at
as high as $714 an ounce, has soared 75 percent, while silver
has risen 64 percent and was at $27.8925 an ounce.  Bond Buying  The Federal Reserve pledged this month to spend an extra
$600 billion buying Treasuries, adding to trillions of dollars
injected by central banks worldwide to inflate their economies
out of the worst global recession since World War II.  Gold may rise to $1,500 or $1,600 an ounce if the dollar
falls to about $1.50 or $1.60 per euro, Lasserre said. The U.S.
currency has lost about 4 percent against the euro this year and
was at $1.3744 at 9:13 a.m. in London.  Societe Generale’s backing of gold and silver is matched by
calls from rival banks. Precious metals will produce the best
commodity returns in the next year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said in a Nov. 9 report, targeting $1,650 an ounce for gold.  Deutsche Bank AG Global Head of Commodities Research
 Michael Lewis  has said that precious metals are some of the
“safest long positions” to have. Still, Lewis also favored
agricultural commodities including corn, soybeans and wheat.  Supply Shocks  “In agriculture there isn’t much upside potential,” said
Lasserre, who’s led the bank’s commodities research team in
Paris since 1997. That lack of potential is because there’s just
been a huge rally, which can be explained by supply shocks, he
said. Sugar may drop toward its long-term floor, he said.  Wheat surged to $8.68 a bushel in Chicago in August after
drought ravaged Russia’s crop, prompting an export ban. Corn,
trading at $5.435 a bushel today, has gained 31 percent this
year. Sugar rose to 33.39 cents a pound on Nov. 11, the highest
since 1981, on bad weather in major growers, including Brazil.  Oil may perform better than base metals and agriculture
over the five years to 2015 as demand picks up, cutting a supply
overhang, Lasserre said. West Texas Intermediate crude may gain
11 percent in a year and 45 percent over five years as a fuel-
supply deficit develops, Lasserre said.  The January-delivery crude contract on the New York
Mercantile Exchange was at $82.82 a barrel today. The price of
the most-active contract has risen 4.4 percent this year.  Copper may rise 23 percent over the next 12 months and lead
may gain 18 percent, according to the bank’s forecasts. Three-
month copper on the London Metal Exchange touched a record
$8,966 a metric ton on Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
