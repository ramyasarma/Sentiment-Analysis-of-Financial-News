Terry Collins  was hired as manager
of the New York Mets to try to help revive the franchise, which
finished 79-83 last year with Major League Baseball’s fifth-
highest payroll.  Collins, 61, a former manager of the Houston Astros and
Anaheim Angels, has a major-league record of 444-434 and has
been effective in leading teams through rebuilding phases, while
never reaching the playoffs. The Mets finished below .500 each
of the last two seasons and haven’t made the World Series since
losing in five games to the New York Yankees in 2000.  His hiring was confirmed by the Mets in a release
announcing an introductory news conference tomorrow at Citi
Field.  Collins spent parts of  10 seasons  playing in the minor
leagues, never recording a major-league at-bat. He then managed
in the minors before being hired by the third-place Astros after
1993.  Collins led Houston to a 224-197 record and three
consecutive second-place finishes in the National League
Central. He was fired after the 1996 season with one year
remaining on his contract, and was hired by the Angels after
Anaheim lost 91 games the previous season.  Collins led the Angels to second-place American League West
finishes in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, after starting the season
51-82 and losing the support of a number of his veteran players,
Collins was fired with 29 games remaining. He hasn’t managed in
the major leagues since.  In five full seasons --  all second-place finishes  --
Collins never has managed in the playoffs. He managed in Japan
in 2007 and 2008, and coached China in the 2009  World Baseball
Classic .  Mets’ Firings  Collins replaces  Jerry Manuel , who had a 204-213 record
with the team and was fired on Oct. 4 along with General Manager
 Omar Minaya . On Oct. 29 the team named 62-year-old  Sandy Alderson  as Minaya’s successor.  Manuel’s tenure as manager was marked by injuries to All-
Stars  Johan Santana  and  Carlos Beltran  and two consecutive
fourth-place finishes in the NL East. The Mets have made the
playoffs once since the 2000 World Series, in 2006 under then-
manager  Willie Randolph . The Yankees have made the playoffs in
15 of the last 16 seasons and won five World Series titles in
that span.  The on-field struggles led to falling attendance rates in
the Mets’ second season at $850 million Citi Field, leading the
team to lower ticket prices by an average of 14 percent for
2011. Attendance this year was 2.6 million, down 600,000 from
2009.  The Mets’ 2010 opening day salary was  $132.7 million , the
fifth-highest of baseball’s 30 teams. The club finished 18 games
behind the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East and one game
behind the Florida Marlins, whose opening day payroll was $55.6
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
