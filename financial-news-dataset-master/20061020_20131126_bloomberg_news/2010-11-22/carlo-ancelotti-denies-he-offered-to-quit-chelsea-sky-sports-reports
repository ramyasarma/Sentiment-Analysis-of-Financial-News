Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti denied
reports that he offered to quit the Premier League soccer
champion, Sky Sports reported.  He had no idea where the speculation about his future came
from, Sky cited him as saying.  There’s been talk about Ancelotti’s future at Stamford
Bridge after the club suffered three defeats in its last four
league games and as Ray Wilkins was dropped as assistant
manager.  Chelsea leads Manchester United on goal difference at the
top of the league after a 1-0 defeat at Birmingham two days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
