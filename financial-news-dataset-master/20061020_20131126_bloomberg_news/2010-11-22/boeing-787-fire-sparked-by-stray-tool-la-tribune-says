A fire in a  Boeing Co.  787
Dreamliner started when a stray tool in an electrical equipment
bay caused a short circuit, French newspaper La Tribune
reported.  The fire raises questions about the logic of the plane’s
electrical layout because the breakdown in the first bay spread
to a second, and the plane had to use emergency electrical-
management systems to land, the  French newspaper  said, citing
sources it didn’t identify.  France’s Zodiac Aerospace SA, a subcontractor of  United
Technologies Corp.  subsidiary Hamilton Sundstrand, which is in
charge of electrical distribution within the plane, is among the
companies reviewing the incident, La Tribune said.  Boeing is based in Chicago and United Technologies’
headquarters is in Hartford, Connecticut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
