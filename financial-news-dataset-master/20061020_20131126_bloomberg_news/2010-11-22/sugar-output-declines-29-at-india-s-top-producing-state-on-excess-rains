Sugar  production in Maharashtra,
India’s biggest producer, fell 29 percent in the season that
began Oct. 1 after heavy rainfall in the main growing areas
slowed harvests, a producers’ group said.  Mills produced 408,000 metric tons until Nov. 20, compared
with 573,000 tons a year ago, said  Prakash Naiknavare , managing
director of the  Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories
Federation Ltd.  About 5 million tons of cane has been crushed,
20 percent less than a year earlier, he said.  A delay in Indian harvests may prompt the government to
defer a decision on freeing exports, supporting a 72 percent
rally in global prices in the past six months. The country will
be “cautious” on ending the curbs to ensure local supplies are
adequate, Junior Farm Minister K.V. Thomas said last week.  “Any delay in exports from India will be a big kicker for
prices,” said  Nirmal Shah , an analyst at Alchemy Share & Stock
Brokers. “With yield and recovery being lower than estimated,
the government may be wary of rushing into making a decision.”  Raw sugar for March delivery slumped 7.1 percent to 26.15
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York on Friday. White
sugar for March delivery fell 4.2 percent to $679.10 a ton in
London the same day. Prices closed at a 29-year high on Nov. 9.  India may probably produce 23.27 million tons, 8.7 percent
less than predicted by industry groups, according to data from
farmers interviewed by SGS SA for Bloomberg News. Output may be
24.5 million tons, Thomas told lawmakers Nov. 19, less than 25
million tons forecast by Farm Minister  Sharad Pawar  on Nov. 11.  The recovery rate narrowed to an average 8.17 percent this
season in Maharashtra from 9.14 percent a year ago, Naiknavare
said. Sucrose content may rebound after rains halt and as the
peak December-February period for crushing approaches, he said.  “If the recovery rate doesn’t improve, then we may have to
revise our earlier estimates,” he said.  Output in Maharashtra may jump 34 percent to a record 9.5
million tons, with mills processing 82.5 million tons, compared
with 61.4 million tons last season, the group said Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
