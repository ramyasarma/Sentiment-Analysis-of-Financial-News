A  Delta Air Lines  Inc. plane bound
for Moscow from New York City returned to John F. Kennedy
International Airport after one of its engines had an automatic
shutdown, the  Federal Aviation Administration  said.  Delta Flight 30 landed safely at 5:49 p.m. local time and
taxied to the ramp without further incident, FAA spokeswoman
 Holly Baker  said in a telephone interview. Earlier reports of a
fire on board the Boeing 767 weren’t accurate, she said.  The flight departed at 4:39 p.m. with 193 passengers and 11
crew members. The crew reported an engine problem shortly after
takeoff and declared an emergency before landing, Delta said in
an e-mailed statement.  Firefighters and emergency personnel were called to the
scene.  Baker said the shutdown occurred in the left engine and the
FAA is investigating the incident.  The passengers will be put on another aircraft that’s
scheduled to depart for Moscow at 10 p.m., Atlanta-based Delta
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
