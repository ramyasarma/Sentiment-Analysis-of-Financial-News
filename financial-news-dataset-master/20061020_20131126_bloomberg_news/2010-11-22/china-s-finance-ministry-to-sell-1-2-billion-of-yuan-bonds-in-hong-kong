China’s government will sell 8
billion yuan ($1.2 billion) of bonds in its second such sale in
Hong Kong, boosting the availability of offshore investment
products as appreciation prospects spur demand for the currency.  The  Ministry of Finance  will sell 5 billion yuan of the
debt to institutional investors, with maturities of three, five
and 10 years, while 3 billion yuan of two-year bonds will be
earmarked for individuals, according to a statement on its
website today. The sale is due to start on Nov. 30, according to
Shou Fugang, chief executive officer at Bank of Communications
Co. (Hong Kong), which is administering the sale.  “The Chinese government is showing support for the
offshore yuan market by offering longer-dated debt to provide
more investment opportunities,” said  Frances Cheung , a Hong
Kong-based senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. “Given the
limited liquidity in the dim sum bond market, this sale may lead
to more trading.”  The finance ministry started to offer government debt in
Hong Kong for the first time in September last year, raising 6
billion yuan, part of its strategy to promote use of the yuan in
global trade and investment. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
estimated last week that the value of yuan-denominated notes in
Hong Kong, so-called dim sum bonds, has risen to 50 billion yuan.  Deposits Double  Shou told a press conference in Hong Kong that this year’s
10-year debt sale would help set a benchmark for the Hong Kong
market and make trade more “active.” The ministry last year
sold five-year bonds in Hong Kong with a 3.30 percent coupon,
three-year securities at 2.70 percent and two-year debt at 2.25
percent.  Yuan deposits  in Hong Kong more than doubled to a record
149 billion yuan in the six months through September and HSBC
Holdings Plc forecast this month they will exceed 400 billion
yuan within three years. HSBC, which controls two of the city’s
three biggest banks, offers interest of 0.71 percent on deposits
of 500,000 yuan or less placed with it for 12 months in Hong
Kong, according to its website.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer, is
in talks to issue $100 million worth of yuan-denominated bonds
in Hong Kong, the Apple Daily Chinese-language newspaper
reported today, without saying where it obtained the information
from or providing a timeline for the planned sale.  Yields Slump  The yield on the Chinese government’s 3.3 percent bond
maturing October 2014 in Hong Kong fell 26 basis points in the
past three months to 2.91 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on Hopewell Highway Infrastructure Ltd.’s
2.98 percent note due July 2012 declined 62 basis points in the
three months through Nov. 19 to 2.18 percent. The company, which
is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Gordon Wu, sold 1.38
billion yuan of notes on July 8.  The yield on China’s benchmark 10-year bonds climbed six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to a one-week high of
3.96 percent as of 2:23 p.m. in Shanghai. The rate for the five-
year notes was 3.65 percent and that for three-year securities
was 2.61 percent.  The yuan has strengthened 2.7 percent to 6.6422 per dollar
since a two-year peg ended on June 19 and 12-month non-
deliverable forwards reflect bets the currency will appreciate
2.8 percent in a year.  -- Belinda Cao  and  Andrea Wong . Editors:  Andrew Janes ,  James Regan   To contact the Bloomberg news staff on this story:
