Siemens AG , Europe’s largest
engineering company, agreed to pay 7 billion naira ($46.5
million) to settle charges of illegal payments to officials in
Nigeria, Justice Minister  Mohammed Adoke  said.  “The federal government has agreed to discontinue the
criminal prosecution it instituted against Siemens,” Adoke told
reporters in Abuja, the capital, today. The company agreed to be
“of good conduct” in future business dealings in the West
African nation, he said.  In December 2008, Siemens agreed to pay $800 million to
settle U.S. charges that it violated anti-corruption laws by
funding bribes to governments around the world, including in
Nigeria. Siemens’ payment to Nigeria is about three times higher
than the alleged bribes, Adoke said, without providing further
details.  Siemens’ agreement with the Nigerian government is “the
last step towards improving relationships with Nigeria,” said
 Joern Roggenbuck , a spokesman for the company, in a phone
interview from Munich today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
