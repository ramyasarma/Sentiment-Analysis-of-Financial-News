A group that claimed an attack on a
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz in
July “remains active and can conduct further attacks,” the
U.S. Maritime Administration said in an advisory on its website.  “Government and industry sources can confirm that the
claim by the Abdullah Azzam Brigades (AAB) that the group had
attacked the tanker M. Star is valid,” the Maritime
Administration said in the advisory.  “Recommend all ships transiting the subject waters
exercise increased vigilance and cuation, particularly during
night transits with increased monitoring of small vessel/boat
activity,” the Maritime Administration said.  The strait connects the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman
and is a transit point for tankers hauling oil from producers
including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
