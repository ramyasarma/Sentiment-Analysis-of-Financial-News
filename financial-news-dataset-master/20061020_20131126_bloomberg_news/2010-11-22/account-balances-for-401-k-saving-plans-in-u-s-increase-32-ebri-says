Savers who kept money in their
401(k) retirement plans saw average account balances rise 32
percent last year, said a  study  by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute and the Investment Company Institute.  Workers who have had money in their 401(k) savings accounts
from 2003 and have been with the same plans had average account
balances of $109,723 in 2009 compared with $83,161 a year
earlier, according to the report released today by the
Washington-based organizations. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
rose by about 23 percent in 2009 after falling 38 percent in
2008.  “Retirement savers, by continuing to invest paycheck by
paycheck, saw the benefits of being in the market in 2009, as
stock values generally climbed during the year,”  Sarah Holden ,
senior director of retirement and investor research for ICI, a
mutual-fund trade group, said in a statement.  The study looked at 4.3 million so-called consistent
participants. The report didn’t break down how much
contributions or investment returns led to larger account
balances. EBRI, a nonprofit, and ICI have a total database of
almost 21 million participants in 51,852 plans holding $1.21
trillion in assets.  Twenty-one percent of 401(k) savers in plans with a loan
option had loans outstanding, up from 18 percent at the end of
2008 and 2007. The average loan amount was $7,346 in 2009, the
report said. Almost 90 percent of participants had plans
offering loans.  The number of people borrowing from their retirement-
savings plans reached a 10-year high in the second quarter of
2010, according to Fidelity Investments. Accounts with loans
outstanding rose to 22 percent by the end of June from 20
percent a year earlier, the Boston-based asset manager said in a
study released in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
