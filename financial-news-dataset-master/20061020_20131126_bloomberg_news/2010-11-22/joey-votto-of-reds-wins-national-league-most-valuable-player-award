Cincinnati Reds first baseman  Joey Votto  was named the National League’s Most Valuable Player over
 Albert Pujols , who claimed the award the past two years.  Votto, who finished second in the NL with a .324 batting
average and third in home runs (37) and runs batted in (113),
received 31 of 32 first-place votes and 443 total points in
balloting by the  Baseball Writers’ Association of America .  Pujols, the St. Louis Cardinals’ first baseman who led
the NL in homers (42) and RBI (118), received the other first-
place vote and was second on 21 other ballots for 279 points,
while batting-average leader  Carlos Gonzalez  of the Colorado
Rockies was third with 240 points.  “I was surprised,” Votto said of the disparity in the
voting results. “When I found out I won the National League MVP
I thought I must have snuck it in there. I didn’t think it would
be so conclusive.”  Players received 14 points for first place, nine for
second, eight for third, on down to one for 10th in the
balloting that was completed before Major League Baseball’s
postseason.  The San Diego Padres’  Adrian Gonzalez  was fourth (197
points, followed by Colorado’s  Troy Tulowitzki  (132) in fifth,
Philadelphia Phillies pitcher  Roy Halladay  (130) in sixth and
the San Francisco Giants’  Aubrey Huff  (70) in seventh.  Votto, a 27-year-old who was born in Toronto, was named a
first-time All-Star in 2010, his fourth season in the major
leagues.  He led the NL with a .424 on-base percentage and a .600
slugging percentage, demonstrating his ability to both get on
base and hit for power. Votto’s 34 go-ahead hits led the major
leagues, according to ESPN.com.  Made Postseason  The effort helped propel the Reds to a 91-71 record, the NL
Central Division title and the team’s first playoff appearance
in 15 years.  During the 2009 season, Votto spent time on the disabled
list while dealing with depression and anxiety attacks following
the sudden death of his 52-year-old father the previous August.
One attack “got to the point where I felt I was going to die,”
he  told reporters  upon his return, according to MLB.com.  Today, Votto said it was too early to put the past couple
years in perspective with what he’s accomplished.  “Not to be dramatic or anything, but after I was told I
couldn’t help but cry because I know how much something like
this meant to me and would have meant to my father,” he said on
a conference call with reporters. “I have overcome a lot, and I
am very proud of myself.”  The Reds’ 1995 playoff season also marked the last time a
Cincinnati player was named MVP, when shortstop  Barry Larkin 
took the honor.  Reds’ MVPs  Reds players have won 10 other MVPs since the award was
first given out in 1911. The  others are  Ernie Lombardi (1938),
Bucky Walters (1939), Frank McCormick (1940),  Frank Robinson 
(1961),  Johnny Bench  (1970, 1972),  Pete Rose  (1973),  Joe Morgan 
(1975, 1976) and George Foster (1977).  Today’s results marked the eighth time that Pujols finished
in the top three in MVP voting, one behind all-time leader  Barry Bonds , who won the award a record seven times.  Pujols, who also was named NL MVP in 2005, would have
become the first player other than Bonds to claim the honor four
times.  The 30-year-old Pujols led the NL with 42 home runs, 118
RBI and 115 runs scored as the Cardinals went 86-76 to finish
five games behind the Reds in the NL Central Division, missing
the playoffs. His .312 batting average was sixth in the league,
his on-base percentage (.414) trailed only Votto and his .596
slugging percentage was third.  Gonzalez’s Statistics  Carlos Gonzalez, 25, led the NL with a .336 batting average
and 351 total bases, posting 34 home runs and 117 RBI.  His .289 batting average in road games was .91 lower than
at home. He had 26 homers and 76 RBI at offense-friendly Coors
Field, compared with eight home runs and 41 RBI in three fewer
road games.  “Albert is the great player,” Votto said. “Myself and
Carlos Gonzalez, we’re learning how to be major leaguers and
establish ourselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
