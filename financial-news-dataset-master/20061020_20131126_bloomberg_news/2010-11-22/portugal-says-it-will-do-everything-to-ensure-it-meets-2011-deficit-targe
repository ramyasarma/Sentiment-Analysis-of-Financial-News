Portugal will do everything to
ensure it will meet a target of cutting its budget deficit to
4.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2011, Finance Minister
Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said.  The budget for next year will be approved this week in a
final vote in parliament following an “important” political
agreement, Teixeira dos Santos said in a statement e-mailed last
night.  The fact that there may be a significant aid plan available
for Ireland reduces uncertainty and reinforces the confidence of
markets, the statement said. “It is, without a doubt, a
positive fact for the stability of the euro zone,” Teixeira dos
Santos said.  Portugal has a banking system that is modern,
sophisticated, well regulated, resilient and well capitalized,
the minister said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
