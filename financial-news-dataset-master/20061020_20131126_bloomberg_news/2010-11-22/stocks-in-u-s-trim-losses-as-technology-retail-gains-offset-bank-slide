U.S. stocks trimmed losses as a
rally in technology and retail shares offset a drop in banks
after federal agents raided three hedge funds and investors grew
more skeptical that an Irish bailout will stop Europe’s debt
crisis from spreading.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,197.35 at 3:48 p.m. in New York after tumbling as much as 1.3
percent earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 25.08
points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,178.47.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
