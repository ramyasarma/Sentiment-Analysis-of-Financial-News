For the first time since the
financial crisis started, U.S. shares are moving  independently 
of the bond market, a sign that profits and valuations are
guiding investors more than concern about the economy.  The 30-day correlation coefficient measuring how often the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index moves in tandem with  10-year
Treasury yields  fell to minus 0.42 from a record 0.89 in June,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Readings of 1 indicate prices
are moving together, while zero shows no link and minus 1 means
they are going in opposite directions. Stocks and debt are
ending a lockstep relationship that began in July 2007 and
lasted through the worst recession since the 1930s.  Pioneer Investments, Security Global Investors and
Citigroup Inc. say the broken connection is bullish as the
greatest number of S&P 500 companies in a decade post earnings
growth. During the bull market from 2002 to 2007 when the  S&P
500’s price  and profits doubled, the correlation averaged 0.15,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “I prefer days when companies are rewarded or punished
based on their performance,” said  John Carey , a Boston-based
money manager at Pioneer, which oversees about $250 billion.
Before, “people were worried that some large events over which
they had no control would influence the direction of the market
and investment results,” he said.  Bernanke’s Pledge  The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,199.73 last
week as China took steps to curb inflation. The index has
advanced 13 percent since Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  hinted on Aug. 27 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that he
would use a strategy known as quantitative easing to boost the
economy. The relationship between the 500 stocks and the
benchmark index fell to 0.55 on Nov. 11, the lowest since May 3,
according to Birinyi Associates Inc. data on 50-day correlation.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,197.84 at 4 p.m. in
New York today.  The relationship using 30 days of data between the S&P 500
and 10-year Treasury yields was last negative in July 2007. It
jumped to 0.79 on Aug. 14, 2007, five days after Paris-based BNP
Paribas SA halted withdrawals from three investment funds
because it couldn’t value their holdings as U.S. subprime
mortgage losses roiled credit markets. The stocks-bonds
relationship never turned negative in 2008.  After Lehman  The S&P 500 plunged 4.7 percent and yields on 10-year
Treasuries tumbled 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage point, on
Sept. 15, 2008, after New York-based Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. filed for bankruptcy. The correlation jumped to 0.83 on
Oct. 6, 2008, as the financial crisis intensified, reaching the
highest level since a month after the Iraq War began in 2003,
data compiled by Bloomberg data show.  Bernanke’s Aug. 27 comments helped end the lockstep moves.
Weaker connections among assets mean profits, takeovers and
valuation will drive returns, Security Global’s  Mark Bronzo 
said. The S&P 500 climbed to a two-year high on Nov. 5 and the
rate on 10-year Treasuries dropped to the lowest level since
2009 on Oct. 8.  While  Howard Ward  of  Mario Gabelli ’s Gamco Investors Inc.
says stocks are likely to rally, loosening correlations aren’t
fueling his optimism.  ‘Real Perceived Difference’  “The correlation is moving lower because of what’s now a
real perceived difference in the return potential for stocks
versus bonds,” said Ward, whose firm oversees $26 billion in
Rye, New York. “I understand people are very anxious about
stocks because of volatility, because of economic uncertainties
and because they didn’t do well for the last 10 years, but
buying bonds today is like buying stocks in 1999,” before the
S&P 500 plunged 49 percent, he said.  Treasuries returned 81 percent between 1999 and 2009 while
the S&P 500 dropped 9.1 percent, including  dividends , for its
first loss over the course of a decade, according to data
compiled by Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch and Bloomberg.  As correlations break down, quarterly financial results are
swaying share prices more than at any time since 2007. S&P 500
companies that  beat  the average analyst profit forecast gained
0.1 percent since reporting results, while those that missed
declined 3.3 percent, according to data compiled through Nov. 16
by Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi. That’s the first time in
three years companies beating estimates rallied and those that
missed fell on average.  Getting Rewarded  “There are those individual names that will produce
stronger earnings and  profit margins , and will be rewarded for
that,” said Bronzo, a money manager in Irvington, New York,
whose firm oversees $22 billion. “We’re returning to a more
normal economic environment as we’re moving past the financial
crisis. So where the market traded all as a group, there’ll be
more of a distinction between sectors and names.”  Third-quarter earnings surpassed analyst projections by 6.6
percent for the 457 companies that have reported since Oct. 7,
Bloomberg data show. It was the sixth  straight  period in which
more than 70 percent of companies beat forecasts, the longest
stretch since at least 1993, according to Bloomberg.  Analysts forecast 87 percent of S&P 500 companies will post
higher earnings next year. That would be the most since at least
2000, estimates from more than 10,000 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “There’s a better chance for active managers to
outperform,” said  Eric Teal , chief investment officer at First
Citizens BancShares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which
manages $5 billion. “Over the past few years, many of the macro
forces have driven the stock market returns and now more
fundamentals are starting to drive the market.”  Stocks, Junk Bonds  Stocks that trade at below-average price-earnings  ratios 
and that trailed benchmark indexes in 2010 -- such as Hewlett-
Packard Co. and Merck & Co. -- should benefit as equity returns
diverge, Carey said. MFS Investment Management’s  James Swanson 
recommends technology companies because they have money to
return to shareholders.  Hewlett-Packard has almost $15 billion in  cash , the 12th-
highest amount in the S&P 500. While at least 28 of 38 analysts
covering the Palo Alto, California-based company recommend
investing in the world’s largest computer maker, the stock has
fallen 18 percent this year, pushing the valuation down to 8.3
times 2011 estimated profit.  Merck, the world’s second-largest drugmaker, has a price-
earnings ratio of 9.2 times next year’s forecasts, Bloomberg
data show. The Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company is
down 3.3 percent this year,  compared  with the S&P 500’s 7.6
percent gain, even as per-share earnings excluding some items
are projected to expand 13 percent next year, the best annual
growth since 2007, according to the analyst average.  ‘My Goodness’  “My goodness, these are very good prices for these
stocks,” Carey said of health-care companies. The 51
pharmaceutical producers, device makers and health insurers in
the S&P 500  trade  for 12 times annual earnings, compared with a
10-year average of 19.2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While the benchmark index for American shares has rallied
77 percent since reaching a 12-year low on March 9, 2009, prices
relative to earnings remain below historical levels. More than
88 percent of S&P 500 stocks are cheaper than their average
since 2005, based on next year’s forecasts, compared with the
decade’s 66 percent mean, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Takeovers picked up this year, with $651 billion worth of
U.S. deals announced since January, compared with $635.8 billion
for all of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Similar Performance  Stronger correlations made it more difficult for mutual
funds to distinguish themselves. The standard deviation, or
variation in returns, for funds invested in the biggest U.S.
companies declined to 4.1 percent in the second quarter, data
compiled by Lipper and Bloomberg show. That was the lowest since
at least 2000. The figure climbed to 9.8 percent last quarter as
correlations weakened.  Returns among money managers mirrored one another
regardless of strategy. An  index  of hedge funds focused on bonds
of distressed companies has returned 8.5 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Chicago-based Hedge
Fund Research Inc. Over the same period, a  gauge  of Latin
America funds returned 7.1 percent. The correlation between the
two has climbed to about 0.28 point more than the 12-year
average, Bloomberg data show.  “More focused investing may be in the process of
developing,”  Tobias Levkovich , Citigroup’s chief U.S. equity
strategist in New York, wrote in a report this month. “As
returns begin to diverge, investors arguably can be well-served
by buying those stocks they deem attractive without worrying
about macro conditions that can swing entire groups.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
