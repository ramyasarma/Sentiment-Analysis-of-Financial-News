New Zealand’s dollar dropped,
erasing earlier gains, after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
revised its outlook on the nation’s foreign currency sovereign
credit rating to negative from stable.  New Zealand’s currency fell to 77.81 U.S. cents as of 4:07
p.m. in Wellington, having reached as high as 78.37 cents
earlier today, from 77.87 cents on Nov. 19 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
