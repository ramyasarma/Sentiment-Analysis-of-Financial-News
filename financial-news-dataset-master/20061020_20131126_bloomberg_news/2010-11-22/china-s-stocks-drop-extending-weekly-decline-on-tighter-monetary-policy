China’s stocks fell, extending a
weekly decline, after policy makers increased the amount of
money that banks must set aside to fight inflation.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 1 percent to 2,859.09 at 9:31 a.m.
The gauge dropped 3.2 percent last week after slumping 4.6
percent the previous week on concern monetary tightening will
hurt economic growth. The CSI 300 Index retreated 1.1 percent to
3,144.46 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
