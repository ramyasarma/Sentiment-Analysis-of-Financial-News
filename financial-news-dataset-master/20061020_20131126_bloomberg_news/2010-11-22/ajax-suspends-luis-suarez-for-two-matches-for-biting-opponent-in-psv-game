Dutch soccer team Ajax suspended
captain Luis Suarez for two games for biting PSV Eindhoven’s
 Otman Bakkal  on the shoulder during a match two days ago.  Suarez will miss Dutch premier league games against VVV-
Venlo and NEC Nijmegen after the “events on Saturday,”
Amsterdam-based Ajax said in a  statement  on its website. The 23-
year-old forward also got a “big fine,” the club said.  “The game had a fiery ending, with chances on both sides
and a moment when Bakkal was bitten by Suarez,” PSV said on its
website. The referee didn’t see the incident, which was picked
up by television coverage.  The match in Amsterdam ended in a 0-0 draw. PSV leads the
league by three points, and is six points ahead of fourth-place
Ajax.  The Dutch Soccer Association is investigating the incident,
public broadcaster  NOS  reported on its website today. Suarez
will play in tomorrow’s Champions League home game against Real
Madrid.  Suarez achieved notoriety while playing for Uruguay during
this year’s World Cup in South Africa when his goalline handball
stopped Ghana scoring in the quarterfinal. He was red-carded,
but Ghana missed the resulting penalty kick and went on to be
defeated in a shootout. Uruguay lost to the Netherlands in the
semifinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
