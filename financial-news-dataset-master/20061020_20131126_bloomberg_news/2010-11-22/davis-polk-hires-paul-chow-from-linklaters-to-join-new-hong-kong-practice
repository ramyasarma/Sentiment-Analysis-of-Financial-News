Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP , the New
York-based law firm that established a Hong Kong law practice
this month, hired  Paul Chow  as a partner in the Chinese city
from London-based Linklaters LLP.  Hong Kong, U.S. and U.K. law capabilities are now required
for sophisticated China deals, and Davis Polk is “exceptionally
well positioned” for them, Chow said in a statement today.  Wall Street law firms  Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP ,
Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP and Shearman & Sterling LLP have hired
new partners to expand their Hong Kong offices in the past year
as they bet that the special administrative region of China is
the key to fees from the world’s fastest-growing major  economy .  Chow has been based in Linklaters’s Beijing office since
July 2007  working  on mergers and acquisitions and capital
markets. His resignation takes effect in May, according to
Amanda Clarke, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Linklaters.  Davis Polk, which hired Bonnie Chan from the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange and  Antony Dapiran  from Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer LLP in August, will have eight partners in Hong Kong
when Chow starts, according to  William Barron , the head of the
U.S. firm’s Asia practice.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
