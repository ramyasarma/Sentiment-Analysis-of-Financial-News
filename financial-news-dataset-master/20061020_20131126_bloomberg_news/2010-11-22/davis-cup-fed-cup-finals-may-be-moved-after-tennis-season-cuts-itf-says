The  International Tennis Federation 
is considering moving the finals of its  Davis Cup  and  Fed Cup 
competitions to earlier dates after the men’s tennis tour cut
its season by two weeks.  The  ATP World Tour  yesterday said it will extend its
offseason to seven weeks from five weeks starting from 2012 so
players will have more time to rest and recuperate.  A move in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup schedules is “under
discussion,” Barbara Travers, a spokeswoman for the London-
based ITF, said in an interview at the ATP World Tour Finals in
London today.  Beginning in 2012, the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals
will start Nov. 5, instead of Nov. 21 this season. The finals of
the Davis Cup, the elite team competition for men, are currently
scheduled for Dec. 3-5, when France plays Serbia in Belgrade.  The finals of the Fed Cup, which were held Nov. 6-7 this
season, may also be moved to an earlier date in order to prevent
a clash with the men’s tour events, Travers said. Italy defeated
the U.S. for the second straight year in the competition.  The Davis Cup committee will discuss any possible changes
during a meeting on Dec. 2 in Belgrade, Travers said.  “It’s really up to the ITF to decide what they want to
do,”  Adam Helfant , executive chairman and president of the ATP
World Tour, said in a news conference yesterday when asked about
possible changes to the Davis Cup schedule. “It seems like a
sensible thing to do, however.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Danielle Rossingh  at the
