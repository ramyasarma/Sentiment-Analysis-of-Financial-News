 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - The surprise star of the Rio Tinto trials, entering their final day in Shanghai on Wednesday, was the billionaire founder of one of China's most aggressive private steel mills. 

 Written testimony from Du Shuanghua, founder of Rizhao Steel, gave a hint of how Rizhao had used its contracts with the giant international miner to leapfrog into the ranks of the largest private Chinese steel mills. The trial of four Rio Tinto employees is being closely watched by foreign investors and the steel industry. Diplomats are barred and lawyers are tight-lipped as the court considers charges that the four, including Australian citizen Stern Hu, stole commercial secrets. By contrast, some details have come from the bribery session on Monday and Tuesday morning, although all but a few Chinese media were barred. Du testified against Wang Yong, a Rio Tinto iron ore salesman, who is battling the largest charge, of accepting 70 million yuan ($10.25 million) in bribes. About $9 million of that came as a payment of appreciation from Du, according to the National Business Daily, one of the few Chinese papers to publish details from the first day of the trial. "If not for Wang Yong's help, my company would never have reached the size it is today," Du said in testimony on Monday, according to the paper. Du used his term iron ore supply from Rio Tinto to guarantee the raw material it needed, at a stable price, allowing him to expand Rizhao Steel's crude output to 8 million tonnes a year. Du became China's eighth-richest man in 2008, with a fortune of 11 billion yuan ($1.61 billion), according to Forbes rankings. By 2010, his wealth had fallen to $1.2 billion, dropping him to number 51 in China but still ranked 828 in its global list. Wang for his part vehemently disagreed with Du's testimony, saying the money had been used to sidestep China's foreign exchange controls and set up a stock trading account in Hong Kong for his brother, the National Business Daily said. While Stern Hu and the two other defendants worked for Rio's representative office in Shanghai, Wang was top salesman for a different unit of Rio, the paper said. That unit was set up to handle ore from Rio's Robe River, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Wednesday. Rio has not commented on the trial, in which its executives pleaded guilty to the bribery charges but contested the amounts. SCRAMBLE TO SURVIVE China's mid-sized mills have fueled the massive increase in national capacity to over 700 million tonnes of steel by expanding to avoid forced mergers with state-owned mills, which have been the centre's preferred means for reining in a fragmented steel sector. To expand, they need stable supply of relatively low-priced term iron ore from the three big miners, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton from Australia and Vale from Brazil. Those firms without term contracts are at the mercy of the volatile spot market, or of the larger state-backed mills and trading firms, which held term contracts but sold to domestic rivals at peak spot prices. Industry sources said desperate mills would offer cash to ensure they got their term allocations whenever Rio reduced term supply or diverted cargoes to the pricier spot market. The China Iron and Steel Association, which speaks for the larger mills, regularly blamed smaller mills for breaking ranks and signing premature deals with the three global miners, when CISA was still negotiating to cap annual rises in term prices. This year, spot prices have once again soared above term prices, and China's competing mills are likely to support iron ore prices for some time to come. Du lost his battle to keep Rizhao independent shortly after the arrest of the four Rio employees, at a time when many Chinese steel executives were under investigation for ties to Rio. Rizhao was taken over in September 2009 by a provincial state-owned steel firm, Shandong Iron and Steel Group, itself made of the reluctant merger of Laiwu Steel and Jinan Steel. All three mills are in Shandong province. Du, who had fought the merger in 2008 by selling 30 percent of Rizhao Steel to a listed company he controlled, finally sold 67 percent of the firm to Shandong Steel. Rizhao's disappearance as an independent mill was widely viewed at the time as an example of "the state advances, the private retreats," as China's state sector, backed by government stimulus money, gained ground at the expense of private firms in the wake of the financial crisis. Two Chinese steel executives, from Laiwu Steel and Shougang Group in Beijing, remain in custody after the Rio-linked investigations, and were named in the prosecutors' case. Rizhao and Laiwu could not be reached for comment, and Shougang did not comment. ($1=6.826 Yuan) (Editing by  Michael Urquhart )
