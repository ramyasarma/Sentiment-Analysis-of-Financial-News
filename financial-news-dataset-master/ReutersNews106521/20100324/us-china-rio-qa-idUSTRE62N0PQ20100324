 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Four Rio Tinto steel executives who admitted taking bribes to conduct business in China face a last day in court on Wednesday, with proceedings focused on allegations they stole commercial secrets. 

 Here are some questions and answers about the case: WHO ARE THE ACCUSED AND WHAT ARE THE CHARGES? Australian Stern Hu and Chinese colleagues Liu Caikui, Ge Minqiang and Wang Yong, who worked for the Anglo-Australian miner, were detained in July and formally arrested in August. They were arrested on suspicion of illegally obtaining commercial secrets and accepting bribes. Initial Chinese media reports that they faced accusations of stealing state secrets did not materialize. All four pleaded guilty to accepting bribes, but contested the amounts alleged by prosecutors. Billionaire steel mogul Du Shuanghua, founder of Rizhao Steel, testified that he gave Wang $9 million in appreciation after Wang helped him secure a term iron ore deal with Rio. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? The four face possibly more than five years jail on the bribery charges, lawyers said, while courts can jail people for up to three years, or even seven in "especially serious" cases, on the commercial secrets charge. A verdict could come any time during the next month and, if convicted, the four can appeal. Although a guilty plea often helps with a more lenient sentence, leaked testimony from the bribery proceedings showed the defendants were vigorously contesting the scale of the charges. China's courts come under the heavy influence of the ruling Communist Party and rarely reject prosecution arguments. IS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED? Chinese investigators may also take up additional cases against steel executives accused of bribery and providing business secrets in the Rio case. An executive at Shougang Group and another at Laiwu Iron and Steel were also detained in connection with the Rio case, but it is unclear whether they have also been formally charged. It is also not clear what the implications are for Du, who sold a majority stake in private Rizhao Steel to state-backed Shandong Steel shortly after the Rio arrests, after fighting that merger for over a year. WHAT DOES THE CASE MEAN FOR THE STEEL INDUSTRY? Rio's China team managed details of term contracts for iron ore, a necessary raw material for China's vast steel industry, as well as tracking market information. The trial added additional uncertainty and wariness to already contentious iron ore negotiations between China and the three big miners -- Rio, fellow Australian miner BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale. Last year China's crude steel output accounted for almost half the world's total. Steel output and iron ore imports both soared to record highs in 2009. China and Rio had hard feelings even before the arrests, following the collapse of a deal by Chinese state-owned aluminum firm Chinalco to increase its stake in Rio, but Chinalco and Rio this month agreed to cooperate on an iron ore project in Guinea. WHAT ARE THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS? The detention of the four at the height of last year's tense negotiations over term iron ore prices stoked investors' worries about doing business in China's murky legal environment. The commercial secrets portion of the trial could revive those worries, since observers weren't allowed and the nature of the charges is unknown. Chinese-born businessmen, including those with foreign citizenship such as Stern Hu, remain particularly vulnerable to China's secrets laws. The trial comes as Google moved its Chinese language search engine to Hong Kong, after a hacking attack led it to challenge China's Internet censorship. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd earlier warned China it had major economic interests at stake and the world was watching how it handled the case. Both governments appear to want to insulate broader ties from any contention over the case, and Australian consular officials stopped pressing for access to the closed portion of the trial after an initial protest. Much is at stake for both sides as China is Australia's biggest trade partner. In 2009, China imported $20.1 billion worth of iron ore from Australia, accounting for about 40 percent of its total volume of iron ore imports. Despite the arrest of the executives, Australian firms, including Rio, continue doing business and deals with China. (Editing by  Ken Wills )
