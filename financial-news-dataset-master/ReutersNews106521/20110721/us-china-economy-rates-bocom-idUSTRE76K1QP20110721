 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China, wary about attracting more hot money inflows and exacerbating local government debt burdens, may refrain from raising interest rates further as inflation loses steam, the chief economist at Bank of Communications said on Thursday. 

 "The pace of policy tightening will slow in the second half. We believe the possibility of another rise in benchmark lending and deposit rates is small," Lian Ping, the bank's chief economist, told reporters. Chinese policy makers should avoid over-tightening as growth slows and many small firms are feeling the pinch from credit curbs, Lian said, but added he still could not rule out a rate rise in the third quarter if inflation is higher than expected. The People's Bank of China is likely to raise banks' reserve requirement ratios by 1-2 times, each at 50 basis points, in the rest of this year to mop up excessive liquidity, according to predictions by the country's fifth-biggest lender. Annual inflation in China may have already peaked at 6.4 percent in June and is likely to ease steadily in the second half, Lian said, noting that slowing money supply growth could gradually influence consumer prices in the coming months. Pork prices have showed signs of stabilizing and there could be a "turning point" as supplies increase, Lian said. But he cautioned that price pressures may not recede quickly due to rising production costs and wages. He predicted that full-year inflation could be about 5.2 percent in 2011, overshooting the government's target of 4 percent. Pork prices surged 57.1 percent in June from a year ago, contributing 1.4 percentage points to June's inflation. The central bank, keen to put a lid on price rises, has lifted the reserve requirement ratio for banks nine times and raised interest rates five times since October. Many analysts expect the central bank to lean more on interest rates to fight inflation in coming months, partly because they see limited room for higher bank reserve ratios, which for big banks stand at a record 21.5 percent. A Reuters poll published on July 7 showed a small majority of analysts expected at least one more rate rise this year. China's GDP growth could slow to 9.3 percent in the third quarter from a 9.5 percent pace in the second quarter, before rebounding to 9.5 percent in the fourth quarter, he said. China's foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, may swell to $3.5 trillion at the end of 2011 from $3.2 trillion at the end of June, driven by capital inflows. The yuan is on track to appreciate about 5 percent against the dollar this year, the bank predicted. "Yuan appreciation is playing a role in curbing imported inflation, but many small exporters will be pushed to the wall if we suddenly let the yuan rise by 10 percent," Lian said.
