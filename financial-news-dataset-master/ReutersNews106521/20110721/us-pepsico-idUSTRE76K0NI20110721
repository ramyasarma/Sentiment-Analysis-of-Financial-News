 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) tempered its full-year outlook on Thursday, citing economic uncertainty, a move that sent its shares down more than 5 percent in their biggest one-day drop since 2008. 

 The maker of Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal said performance in its North American beverage business was worse than it expected, due to weakened consumer demand and intensifying competition, which has made it difficult to raise prices to offset soaring commodity costs. "Of the three factors impacting North America beverages -- inflation, consumer demand and pricing -- the consumer demand picture is the most concerning to us at this point," Chief Executive Indra Nooyi told analysts on a conference call. "In fact, the modest pickup in total consumer spending almost all U.S. businesses saw earlier in the year has reversed in the past several months," she said. The pain was more acute in the beverage business than the food business, Nooyi said, because consumers have a host of cheaper things to drink, including tap water. That pullback in demand, along with a lack of large price increases from rival Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ), led Pepsi to delay its own price increases, since they usually hurt demand further. The company raised prices on July 11, and said the benefit would be felt more in the fourth quarter than the current third quarter. Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham said he was not surprised that Pepsi adjusted its outlook. "This isn't going to be unusual. People are going to recognize that the third and fourth quarters are going to be more challenging than the first half of the year," Gorham said. Pepsi now expects 2011 earnings to grow at a high single-digit rate, from the $4.13 per share it earned in 2010. The new forecast includes a 2 percentage-point boost from foreign exchange rates. Its prior target, for growth of 7 to 8 percent, did not include that boost. PepsiCo shares were down 4.2 percent at $65.60 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon. The last time they fell that much in one day was in December 2008. DIFFICULTY PRICING PepsiCo said net income in the second quarter ended on June 11 rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.17 per share, from $1.60 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.21 per share, matching analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue jumped about 14 percent to $16.83 billion, helped by the recent acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, a Russian drinks company. Analysts were expecting $16.4 billion. Sales volume rose 10 percent in the snacks business and 5 percent in the drinks business. Volume fell 1 percent in the Americas beverage business and 2 percent at the North American Quaker Foods division. Frito-Lay North America volume rose 2 percent. In an effort to prevent price increases from hurting sales volume too badly, Pepsi said it will gauge consumers' reaction to the increases and make adjustments accordingly. "As such, predicting the ultimate pricing realization for the back half of 2011 is more challenging than it would be in a more stable consumer environment," said Hugh Johnston, Pepsi's chief financial officer. Coke has said it was committed to raising prices by 3 percent to 4 percent in the second half of the year.
