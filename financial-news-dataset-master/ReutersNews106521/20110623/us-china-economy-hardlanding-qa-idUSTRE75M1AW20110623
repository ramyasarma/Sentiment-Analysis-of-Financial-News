 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's turbo-charged growth is slowing under the weight of a tighter policy and weaker global demand, fuelling fears among some investors that the world's second-largest economy is sliding toward a hard landing. 

 Worries of slackening growth were revived again on Thursday after a purchasing managers' survey showed Chinese factories barely expanded in June. But in an economy which has expanded at an average breakneck pace of 10 percent a year since 1980, what would be considered a hard landing? Below are some questions and answers on China's economic outlook and the main risks to its growth, which has been a key driver behind the global recovery from the financial crisis. WHAT WOULD BEIJING DEFINE AS A HARD LANDING? A hard landing is usually defined as an economy rapidly falling into recession, and often occurs after a government has had to aggressively tighten policy to cool inflation or if an economy suffers abrupt internal or external shocks. In China, however, no one thinks the economy will come even close to shrinking, the typical definition of a recession, even though monetary policy tightening is running into its ninth month. But many analysts believe a sudden slip in quarterly growth to between 7-8 percent could lead to a Chinese-style hard landing by slashing job creation and driving up unemployment. The economy grew 9.7 percent in the first quarter. Kevin Lai, an economist at Daiwa, estimates that as China's employment rate rises by one percentage point, economic growth needs to be 2.5-percentage points faster. By this definition, China experienced its last hard landing during the global financial crisis in 2008/09, when quarterly growth slumped to a low of 6.6 percent in the first quarter. The collapse in growth threw 20 million migrant workers out of jobs. All said, investors frequently refer to different timeframes when they talk about the chance of a hard landing in China. Most bank analysts have a six- to 12-month horizon when they say China will not experience a hard landing. But Nouriel Roubini, the economist who predicted America's housing crisis, has said China faces a "meaningful probability" of a hard landing beyond 2013 due to excess investment. WHAT COULD TRIGGER A HARD LANDING? Pessimists cite a potential collapse of China's property bubble and a banking sector that is vulnerable to a spike in bad loans as key factors that could ground China's economy. But risks from the two are contained for now. Although China's property prices are at a record high and still grinding upward, and are a growing source of public concern, household debt is still very low. China's household-debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 19 percent at the end of last year, according to Bank of America-Merril Lynch, well under the 96 percent seen in the United States in 2008, according to First Global Research. With downpayments for first and second homes standing at 30 percent and 60 percent respectively, banks are also buffered against price lurches. So far, the worst-case scenario imagined by banks and experts is for house prices to drop a modest 10 percent, as policy tightening turns away buyers in a market otherwise deemed to be supported by short supply and rising incomes. Under a worst-case scenario envisioned by Credit Suisse, property loans pose a bigger threat to China's growth than bad local government debt. According to the bank, China could suffer a "perfect storm" of crises when falling property prices are matched by a slowing Chinese economy and rising debt defaults among local governments, causing sour property loans to climb as high as 921 billion yuan ($142.5 billion). WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING? Beijing acknowledges that China's present reliance on investment and exports for growth is unsustainable and wants to rebalance the economy to promote consumption. To make that transition, Beijing has signaled it is ready to sacrifice some growth. Its annual growth target is 7 percent over the five years to 2015, down from 7.5 percent in the last five years. At the same time, it has made clear its eyes are still on inflation, which has raced to near three-year highs. The central bank raised banks' reserve requirements last week for the ninth time since October, brushing aside worries it may be tightening policy too far to hurt growth. That said, official concerns that higher interest rates could raise local governments' debt burden, and draw hot money inflows to worsen China's inflation headache would likely lead Beijing to tarry on further rate increases. In line with that, a Reuters poll this month showed analysts believe China could raise reserve requirements by another 100 basis points this year, but may only lift deposit rates by an additional 50 basis points.
