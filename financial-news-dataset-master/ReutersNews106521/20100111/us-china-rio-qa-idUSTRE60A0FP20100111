 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's probe into four detained Rio Tinto employees, including Australian Stern Hu, is set to move forward as soon as Monday, when authorities could decide whether to extend investigations, seek prosecution or drop charges. 

 An Australian foreign ministry spokeswoman said she expected a decision. Here are some questions and answers about the case, which has raised international investor concern. WHAT ARE THE FOUR ACCUSED OF? Hu was arrested in August with three Chinese executives from the big Anglo-Australian mining company that does extensive business with China. The three Chinese are Liu Caikui, Ge Minqiang and Wang Yong. They were formally arrested in August on suspicion of illegally obtaining commercial secrets and bribery, allowing authorities to hold them while the investigation proceeds. Earlier reports of allegations they stole state secrets were dropped. Under the commercial secrets charge, courts can jail people for up to three years, or up to seven years in "especially serious" cases. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Investigators may tell lawyers as soon as Monday what happens next to the men. The investigators could extend their inquiry for another month or two, send the case to prosecutors to decide whether to go to trial, or abandon the case, Zhai Jian and Zhang Peihong, the lawyers for Ge and Wang respectively, told Reuters. Zhang said it was not certain that prosecutors will tell the lawyers on Monday whether the men will be tried and on what charges. "We just have to wait for word," he said. Rio's China team negotiated and managed details of term contracts for iron ore, in demand from China's vast steel industry, as well as tracking market information. Rio has said the four did nothing wrong. WHAT DOES THE CASE MEAN FOR THE STEEL INDUSTRY? The Rio arrests have added an element of uncertainty and wariness to already contentious iron ore negotiations between China and the three big miners: Rio, its fellow Australian miner BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale. China's steel industry dwarfs all others, producing as much steel as the eight next biggest steelmaking countries in 2008. That means iron ore talks between China and the big miners are hugely significant for the global steel industry. China and Rio had hard feelings even before the arrests, following the collapse of a deal by Chinese state-owned aluminum firm, Chinalco, to increase its stake in Rio. After more than six months of haggling in 2009, China and the miners never fully resolved the iron ore price Chinese steel mills would pay for term imports. Traditionally, Chinese mills accept whatever deal is settled first between any mill and any of the big three, and Chinese mills ended up quietly accepting a provisional price similar to the deal Rio agreed with other big Asian steelmaking clients. But China's steel industry association, which led last year's negotiations, refused to settle on that price and sought to change the basis of talks for 2010 prices. The strong rhetoric, against the background of the arrests, has left many questions hanging over the 2010 talks. China claimed victory in ore negotiations in August when it sealed a deal with upstart Australian miner Fortescue Metals Group for iron ore supply in the second half of 2009, but that later unraveled when the two sides failed to finalize a funding package that was part of the agreement. With no definitive starting point for 2010 talks, negotiations for the new contract may again be bitter. Miners will point to soaring spot prices -- up by a quarter in the past three weeks -- as grounds for contract price rises in excess of 20 percent. WHAT ARE THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THE CASE? The detention of the four has stoked investors' worries about doing business in China's murky legal environment, where the ruling Communist Party controls the courts and exerts powerful sway over crime investigations and commercial negotiations. Revelations that a U.S. national has been detained since 2007 on secrets charges related to business dealings have added to those worries. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd earlier warned China it had major economic interests at stake in detaining Hu and the world was watching how it handled the case. But Australia has said the case would not harm trade with China, and both governments appear to want to insulate broader ties from any contention over the case, especially after the state secrets spying accusation was dropped. Much is at stake for both sides. China is Australia's biggest trade partner, worth $53 billion last year. Australia exported $15 billion worth of iron ore to China in 2008 -- 41 percent of China's iron ore imports in that period. Since the arrest of the Rio executives, Australian companies, including Rio, have continued doing business with China. In August, U.S. major ExxonMobil Corp signed a deal to sell liquefied natural gas from its share of an LNG project in western Australia to PetroChina in a deal worth about A$50 billion ($46 billion), the biggest trade deal ever between Australia and China. Australia and China finalized a deal this week with Yanzhou Coal Mining Co buying Australia's Felix Resources. China Investment Corp (CIC), a $300 billion wealth fund, may be weighing up a bid for state-owned Chinalco's stake in Rio Tinto.
