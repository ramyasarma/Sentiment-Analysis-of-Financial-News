 (Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized countries and the wider Group of 20, which includes big emerging economies such as China and Brazil, are meeting in Canada on Saturday. 

 Following are highlights from quotes by leaders and other officials attending the meetings. FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY On the possibility of new, global taxes on banks and financial transactions: "We have to have a framework to impose a tax on banks and we will launch it. We will not impose a bank tax on others, but we want a framework .... and we will fight to get it." On reducing budget deficits: "We decided to have a coordinated approach to the crisis. Everyone agreed that the countries that are most indebted and with biggest deficits should reduce deficits. I know that all the pre-G8 papers were betting on a confrontation. I tell you this confrontation did not occur." GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: On bank and financial transactions taxes: "We have unfortunately no common position in the G20 neither on a bank levy nor on a financial-transaction-tax." "We are not at the end of the road for financial market regulations, but in the middle." On reducing debts or pushing for growth: "There is a common position in the G8 that the time of huge expenditure programs ended and that we have to introduce exit strategies." "Perhaps there are different positions on the speed for introducing exit strategies." AUSTRALIA FINANCE MINISTER WAYNE SWAN -- Financial sector reform: He urged acceleration of reforms but said there is no one-size-fits-all approach: "There are particular features of markets and institutions that legitimately differ by country. This means need to be flexible enough to cover these differences." "We believe that standards and supervision are two sides of the same coin of strong, sound financial systems," "While we need to continue our cooperation at the G20, it will always be a case that countries will need to tailor global agreements to suit domestic circumstances," -- On fiscal measures: "Concerns over fiscal sustainability in some European countries ... underscore the need for advanced deficit economies across the world to establish credible fiscal plans." However, Swan believes that the speed and timing of this consolidation must be tailored to national circumstances. -- On China: "It's a move that is in China's best economic interest and it will help produce a more balanced global economy." MONTEK SINGH AHLUWALIA, INDIA'S G20 DEPUTY -- On financial sector reforms: "There is a lot that needs to be done. Clearly since different countries have different degrees of problems in the financial sector, the urgency with which each country has to do something differs." "But the broad process of agreeing on an international architecture will hopefully be completed soon." -- On bank levy: "Our view is that it's not necessary for us, that doesn't stop anyone else from having it, and we've made it plain. It depends on what kind of a reference you have. "If you have a reference that says: some countries want to do it, and others don't, and countries are free to do what they like, that's easy to do." DIMITRI SOUDAS, SPOKESMAN FOR CANADA PRIME MINISTER HARPER "The prime minister also will point out that if the G20 is to be the premier international economic forum it will need to take further steps to protect the recovery and set in motion strong, sustainable and balanced growth." -- On bank tax: "We fully understand that countries that had to use public funds to bail out their banks or countries where banks failed would want to impose a tax on their banks. There will be a discussion about it. I think the G20 can play a role to create a framework on this issue but the bottom line is that, as we have always said, the approach to take will be determined at the national level." -- Financial reform: "Obviously there are certain issues like reforming international financial institutions ... where we believe things can move ahead a bit faster, a bit more aggressive in order to ensure we close the loop on these things and prevent similar circumstances to occur."
