 (Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized countries and the wider Group of 20, which includes big emerging economies such as China and Brazil, are meeting in Canada on Saturday. 

 Following are highlights from quotes by leaders and other officials attending the meetings. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA On economic policies in the U.S. and UK: "There has been differentiated responses taken by the two countries because of their different positions. But we are aiming in the same direction, which is long-term sustainable growth that puts people to work." U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER On China's move to loosen the peg between its yuan currency and the dollar: "This is an important step toward helping China better meet its own challenges and providing a more level playing field for all its trading partners." -- On the need for the G20 to go for growth: "We all recognize that as part of an effective strategy to make sure that we're bringing this world out of crisis, we have to make sure that people understand that we are going to take the steps necessary to bring down our deficits over time. But we also need to make sure we're growing. We have to find the right balance. That balance is going to differ across countries. But I think you're going to see a strong commitment again by these major economies to do what is necessary to make sure that we are supporting recovery and getting that balance right." " JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER NAOTO KAN On fiscal discipline: "Making growth compatible with fiscal consolidation is important not only for Japan but for all the countries in the G8". "I explained how we will boost economic growth by focusing on creating jobs and how this would allow us to overcome deflation and help to improve fiscal conditions. The G8 showed some level of understanding for this." FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY On the possibility of new, global taxes on banks and financial transactions: "We have to have a framework to impose a tax on banks and we will launch it. We will not impose a bank tax on others, but we want a framework .... and we will fight to get it." -- On reducing budget deficits: "We decided to have a coordinated approach to the crisis. Everyone agreed that the countries that are most indebted and with biggest deficits should reduce deficits. I know that all the pre-G8 papers were betting on a confrontation. I tell you this confrontation did not occur." GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: On bank and financial transactions taxes: "We have unfortunately no common position in the G20 neither on a bank levy nor on a financial-transaction-tax." "We are not at the end of the road for financial market regulations, but in the middle." -- On reducing debts or pushing for growth: "There is a common position in the G8 that the time of huge expenditure programs ended and that we have to introduce exit strategies." "Perhaps there are different positions on the speed for introducing exit strategies." AUSTRALIA FINANCE MINISTER WAYNE SWAN On financial sector reform: He urged acceleration of reforms but said there is no one-size-fits-all approach: "There are particular features of markets and institutions that legitimately differ by country. This means need to be flexible enough to cover these differences." "We believe that standards and supervision are two sides of the same coin of strong, sound financial systems," "While we need to continue our cooperation at the G20, it will always be a case that countries will need to tailor global agreements to suit domestic circumstances," -- On fiscal measures: "Concerns over fiscal sustainability in some European countries ... underscore the need for advanced deficit economies across the world to establish credible fiscal plans." However, Swan believes that the speed and timing of this consolidation must be tailored to national circumstances. -- On China: "It's a move that is in China's best economic interest and it will help produce a more balanced global economy." MONTEK SINGH AHLUWALIA, INDIA'S G20 DEPUTY On financial sector reforms: "There is a lot that needs to be done. Clearly since different countries have different degrees of problems in the financial sector, the urgency with which each country has to do something differs." "But the broad process of agreeing on an international architecture will hopefully be completed soon." -- On bank levy: "Our view is that it's not necessary for us, that doesn't stop anyone else from having it, and we've made it plain. It depends on what kind of a reference you have. "If you have a reference that says: some countries want to do it, and others don't, and countries are free to do what they like, that's easy to do." CANADA PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER On Afghanistan: "Everybody recognizes that the challenges there remain significant ... (and) pretty severe. That said, I think there's a general recognition around the G8 table that we have to continue to put our shoulder to the wheel to ultimately ensure that what we leave behind is a stable Afghanistan ... and not a potential source of terrorism or a potential failed state." -- On summit discussions: "In terms of the G20, we all, I think, know what the critical issues are going forward -- we are now focused a little less on crisis management than we were maybe a year or so ago, but none the less, we have important issues in front of us, obviously financial sector reform has to continue, has to be moved forward aggressively, we have to fix the problems that began the crisis and make sure they are not repeated." "I think leaders also realize there is a balancing act there between the necessity of bringing in significant reforms to regulation in that sector and doing it in a way that doesn't choke off credit creation in the period to come." -- On fiscal stimulus: " ... we also know that there are tensions there that are real in terms of stimulus, in terms of effects on economic growth, so there is also, once again, somewhat of a balancing act to undertake."
