 SEOUL  (Reuters) - March auto sales at Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) jumped more than a third, thanks to new model launches and strong shipments from plants in China and India, it said on Thursday, sending its shares to a three-month high. 

 The South Korean carmaker unveiled a revamped Sonata mid-size sedan in the United States in February, which helped push U.S. sales to a record last month. The firm is likely sold about 47,000 to 48,000 vehicles in the U.S. market last month, up as much as 18 percent from a year earlier, its U.S. CEO said on Wednesday. The monthly results eased concerns that aggressive marketing from Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), which offered deep discounts in March after a series of recalls, could hit Hyundai's strong sales growth in recent months. Hyundai sold 317,973 vehicles last month, up 36 percent from a year ago and 27 percent higher than February. The upgraded Sonata sedan and sports utility vehicle Tucson led the shipment growth, forcing the world's No. 4 automotive group to run its U.S. plant in Alabama almost at full capacity for the first time since it was launched in 2005, analysts said. Its affiliate Kia Motors ( 000270.KS ), in which Hyundai Motor has a 35 percent stake, said it sold 173,095 units in March, up 55 percent from a year earlier. Shares at Hyundai, the third-largest stock on the domestic bourse, rose 5.6 percent to as high as 122,000 won, its strongest intra-day level since December 30, 2009, before closing up 4.8 percent.
