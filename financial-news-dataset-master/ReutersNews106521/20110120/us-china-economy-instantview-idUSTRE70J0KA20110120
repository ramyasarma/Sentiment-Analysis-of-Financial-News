 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's economic growth quickened in the fourth quarter, while consumer inflation eased in December from a 28-month high in November. 

 COMMENTARY: DONG XIAN'AN, CHIEF MACRO ECONOMIST WITH INDUSTRIAL SECURITIES, BEIJING: "China's economic drivers, including investment, exports and consumption, are returning to its long-term average levels in month-on-month terms. "Inflation is expected to fall after the Spring Festival and before early March in monthly terms at the earliest. "The authorities have been very swift in tightening its policies these days to curb overheating risks. "Data shows that the economy is on track for a soft landing. "We think the Chinese economy will be more stable this year than the last three years." HE YIFENG, AN ANALYST WITH HONGYUAN SECURITIES IN BEIJING: "GDP growth was particularly strong in the last quarter of 2010 partly thanks to a booming car market and a noticeable rebound in property sales. "In fact, over-heating signs have already emerged in the Chinese economy. The government may have to take measures to cool off real economic activity soon. "Inflation will accelerate again in January after the slowdown in December, and CPI in January may hit 5.5 percent. "The central bank will continue to raise bank deposit reserve requirements in coming weeks, and the next interest rate rise will take place in March or April." ISAAC MENG, ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, BEIJING: "Growth is not a big problem. The focus is still on inflation. The inflation number is still rising. PPI is around 6 percent and is relatively strong. It is quite ominous that we are half-way into January and liquidity and credit growth are strong. That means inflation pressure is intensifying into January and the tightening pressure will intensify, especially considering the stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP growth and exports will remain relatively robust in H1." HUA ZHONGWEI, AN ANALYST WITH HUACHUANG SECURITIES, BEIJING: "The Dec CPI slowdown is in line with expectations, but prices may rebound again in January and February of 2011. We believe it's still possible for the CPI to exceed 5 percent in coming months, for which the market is very worried that more policy tightening is under way. "The acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter showed that the economic growth rate would be off the agenda for Beijing. In other words, taming inflation will be the sole priority for Chinese economic policies. "If bank credit remains strong and inflation rebounds, the central bank is very likely to increase benchmark interest rates in the first quarter." DONGMING XIE, CHINA ECONOMIST AT OCBC BANK, SINGAPORE: "Growth momentum remains strong. However, inflation is the key focus of the market. It will be a challenging year for China to battle inflation. "December inflation is higher than our expectations. Food prices continued to go up in the first half of this month due to seasonal demand. "January inflation will very likely go back above 5 percent. Coupled with strong money inflows evidenced by rising forex purchases, inflationary pressure may remain high for the first half of this year." ANDY JI, ECONOMIST/STRATEGIST AT COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY: "A good set of data, which is more or less what the market had expected, and should be positive for risk and commodities in the short-term.

MARKET REACTION: -- The Shanghai stock market was down 0.59 percent at 0220 GMT, compared with a drop of 0.63 percent  before the data came out. The yuan edged up to 6.5860 per dollar from 6.5858. BACKGROUND: - The economy is growing strongly even as the government ratchets up efforts to steer money and bank credit back to normal to put a lid on inflation. -- The latest Reuters poll showed that China's annual economic growth is likely to slow to 9.3 percent in 2011. But on a quarterly basis, the rate of expansion is likely to bottom out in the first quarter of 2011. [ID:nSGE70I02] - China's central bank raised required reserves on Friday, the fourth time in just over two months and the seventh since early 2010. China also raised interest rates twice last year, once in October and once in December. - Further policy tightening is expected as the Chinese leaders have put the task of taming inflation at the top of their agenda, while the People's Bank of China has switched to a "prudent" monetary policy from "moderately loose."
