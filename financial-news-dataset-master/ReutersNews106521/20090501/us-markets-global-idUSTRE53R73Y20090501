 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday on a more upbeat U.S. economic news while U.S. stocks closed higher as rising optimism the worst of a deep recession may be over offset selling pressure caused by investors locking in strong gains in April. 

 The U.S. dollar and yen fell as the data lifted risk appetite and pared demand for both currencies as a refuge for safety against the global slowdown. The data knocked down U.S. government bond prices, sending yields to new 5-month highs. U.S. consumers felt much more upbeat about the economy last month, when the manufacturing sector also appeared to be crawling out of a deep recessionary hole, reports showed. Sentiment also was supported by encouraging data from Asian export powerhouses China and South Korea. But trading volume was weak as markets around the world were closed for the May 1 holiday. Japan and London markets will shut on Monday. Recent economic data and a note of optimism from the U.S. Federal Reserve this week has boosted risk appetite worldwide. "Risk appetite is definitely coming back and the data this morning was phenomenal," said Melvin Harris, a market analyst at Advanced Currency Markets in New York. "The reports are supportive factors to truly build the case that while things are not completely better yet, we are moving in a positive direction. Economic fundamentals will become more important in the next couple of months." MSCI's all-countries index .MIWD00000PUS for the eighth straight week, as did the tech-heavy Nasdaq, its longest streak since December 1999. A 4 percent gain in oil prices lifted Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and other energy stocks, which helped U.S. equity indexes climb slightly higher. Exxon rose 1 percent to $68.01, and the S&P energy index .GSPE gained 3 percent. U.S. crude futures jumped $2.08 to settle at $53.20 a barrel after hitting $53.65, the highest since April 3. Brent crude settled up $2.05 at $52.85. Improved consumer sentiment and evidence of record compliance to agreed output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pushed crude higher. OPEC reduced supply in April, implementing 84 percent of an agreed output cut, a Reuters survey showed. Compliance set a record, with the average around 60 percent. Downward pressure on stocks came from investors who chose to book some gains after the strong run-up since the bear market low in early March. The benchmark S&P 500 index recorded its biggest rise in nine years last month. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 44.29 points, or 0.54 percent, to 8,212.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 4.71 points, or 0.54 percent, to 877.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 1.90 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,719.20. For the week, the Dow rose 1.7 percent, the S&P 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq 1.5 percent. Britain's top share index was flat by the close after sharp gains the previous two sessions, with rising mining stocks offset profit taking in energy and defensive shares. The pan-European FTSEurofirst  .FTEU3  closed 0.1 percent higher at 829.65 and the FTSE 100  .FTSE  index closed 0.49 points lower at 4,243.22. Other European markets were closed. Miners gained as metal prices firmed, with copper hitting one-week highs in London. Copper settled 2.6 percent higher at $2.1010 a pound, its highest level on a closing basis since April 20. The euro rose 0.30 percent at $1.3266. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.32 percent at 84.549. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.73 percent at 99.28. U.S. Treasury debt prices were lower. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 12/32 in price to yield 3.17 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1/32 in price to yield 0.92 percent. Gold ended lower in quiet trade on Friday as signs of economic recovery dent safe-haven demand. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down $3.00 at $888.20 an ounce in New York. Japanese stocks set a four-month closing high, with the Nikkei average  .N225  gaining 1.7 percent despite more bleak data showing the economy slipping back into deflation and unemployment rising at a record pace in March. But the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares .MIAPJ0000PUS outside Japan dipped 0.2 percent and pulled back from a six-month high, mainly on a slight drop in Australian shares .AXJO. Most markets included in the index were closed.
