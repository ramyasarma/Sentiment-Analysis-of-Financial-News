 SHANGHAI (Reuters) China gave Google Inc approval to operate its Chinese search page, averting a possible shutdown of its flagship site in the world's biggest Internet market.

The two rivals reach a settlement on the suit over Lee in December. Jan 2006 - Google introduces Google.cn, its China-based search page that, in accordance with Chinese rules, censors search results.

The comments come a day after Google.com, Gmail and other Google online services became inaccessible to many users in China. Sept 2009 - Lee resigns as Google China head to start his own company. Google appoints sales chief John Liu to take over Lee's business and operational responsibilities. Oct 2009 - A group of Chinese authors accuses Google of violating copyrights with its digital library, with many threatening to sue. Jan 2010 - Google says it is no longer willing to censor searches in China and may pull out of the country. The company postpones launch of two Android phones in China. Feb 2010 - The New York Times reports the hacking attacks on Google had been traced to two schools in China, citing people familiar with the investigation. The schools deny involvement. March 22, 2010 - Google announces it will move its mainland Chinese-language portal and begin rerouting searches to its Hong Kong-based site. March 30, 2010 - Google's services are partially blocked, but the company doesn't know if the stoppage was a technical glitch or a deliberate move by the government. June 30, 2010 - China issues discloses a preliminary list of companies permitted to get a license. Google is not on it. The company says it will stop rerouting China users to its uncensored Hong Kong site within 48 hours. July 9, 2010 - China issues license for Google's search page.
