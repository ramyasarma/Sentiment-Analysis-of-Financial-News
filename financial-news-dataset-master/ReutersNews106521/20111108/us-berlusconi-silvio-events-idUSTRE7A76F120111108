 (Reuters) - Here is a timeline on Silvio Berlusconi since he won power again in Italy in 2008:

January 2010 - On his first day back at work almost a month after he was attacked, Berlusconi works out a three-pronged strategy to regain his immunity from prosecution. March - Italy's senate approves a law shielding Berlusconi and his ministers from trial for 18 months. April - After mounting tensions in the ruling Party of Freedom (PDL), Berlusconi and former ally Gianfranco Fini engage in a public shouting match with Fini accusing Berlusconi of running the party like a monarch. July - Berlusconi wins a confidence vote on an austerity package deemed crucial to protect Italy's financial stability. July - Berlusconi splits with Fini, accusing him of trying to administer a "slow death" to their party.
