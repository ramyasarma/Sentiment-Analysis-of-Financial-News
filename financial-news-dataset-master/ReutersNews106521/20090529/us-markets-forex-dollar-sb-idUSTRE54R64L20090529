 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Already armed with multiple reasons to sell dollars, investors focused on another one this week: speculation that rising long-term U.S. interest rates will force the Federal Reserve to buy more government debt. 

 That should encourage investors already betting against the greenback to continue selling, possibly sending it to new multi-month lows against several major currencies. Signs of improvement in the global economy and hopes that the worst of the financial crisis is over have dried up safe-haven flows into the dollar in recent months, stalling a rally that in 2008 lifted it nearly 6 percent against a basket of six major currencies .DXY. With markets no longer bracing for another bank failure such as the one that toppled investment bank Lehman Brothers and with global interest rates converged at or near zero, investors are basing currency strategies on other factors. SELL Perhaps the biggest drag on the dollar now is the soaring U.S. deficit, an issue that took on added urgency this week when long-term Treasury yields spiked, making it more costly for the government to finance a $1.8 trillion budget gap. Strategists say the Federal Reserve, which began buying $300 billion in long-dated Treasury bonds in March to keep interest rates low, may have to redouble its efforts. Ashraf Laidi, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said that would weaken the dollar because it would require the Fed to print more money to buy the debt, flooding the market with dollars and raising fears of a big jump in inflation. "When they announced bond purchases of $300 billion, that was very bad for the dollar, and we can expect more negative repercussions if they step up those purchases," said Laidi, who expects the Fed to increase its target to $500-$700 billion. Laidi is bullish on the euro, which he said may rise to $1.47 by the end of June from its current $1.3920. He also said the Australian dollar looked like a good bet due to higher commodity prices and strong trade links with China, which has strong demand for the oil, copper and other commodities that Australia can provide. "People usually talk of buy-and-hold strategies in relation to equities, but if there's a buy-and-hold trade in FX, it's to buy the Aussie against the dollar," he said. Robert Blake, senior currency strategist at State Street Global Markets, said investors have already started unwinding bets in favor of the dollar that built up over the last year and are in some case actively amassing short positions. The yen is trickier, as persistently low Japanese interest rates have encouraged Japanese investors to invest abroad. That's helped the dollar rise against the yen this week, though some analysts said the Australian and New Zealand dollars may prove even bigger beneficiaries if this trend persists. BUY Making a pro-dollar case is tougher in the current atmosphere. But there are those who argue recent selling -- the dollar has fallen sharply in five of the last six weeks against major currencies -- has been overdone. UBS strategist Brian Kim said he expects the euro to remain around the $1.40 level over the next month as deficit worries dog the dollar but sees a retreat to $1.35 in late summer. "We're a bit more constructive over three months," Kim said, because if the United States recovers first from the downturn, investors would likely pour into U.S. assets. Strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman also argue that some of the very measures that have swelled the U.S. deficit -- zero interest rates, Fed purchases of Treasuries and other assets, and hefty stimulus spending -- will help the U.S. economy bounce back more quickly. That could let the Fed lift benchmark interest rates, thereby increasing the dollar's appeal. For now, though, high bond yields probably won't spur many to buy dollars, UBS' Kim said, since yields are rising on deficit fears, not because the U.S. economy has recovered.
