 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China should speed up diversification of its $3.2 trillion foreign exchange reserves away from dollar assets to hedge against risks of the U.S. currency's possible long-term decline, an adviser to the People's Bank of China said on Thursday. 

 "We should accelerate diversification in reserve investment," Xia Bin, an academic member of the central bank's monetary policy committee, told Reuters in an interview. China faces "pressures and challenges" in managing its fast-accumulating foreign exchange reserves, but the holdings may also present the country with an "unprecedented" opportunity to help its long-term development, Xia said. China's reserves, the world's largest, swelled by $152.8 billion in the second quarter to a record $3.2 trillion, driven by sustained capital inflows and its large trade surplus. Chinese officials have pledged to diversify the huge reserves -- as much as 70 percent of which are now in U.S. dollar assets, according to analyst estimates -- but the process has been gradual. Xia pointed to examples of such diversification, saying China has added more Japanese government debt and other non-dollar assets. The adviser said the U.S. currency would retain its role as the major global reserve currency because there is no obvious candidate to displace it. "From a long-term prospective, say 10 to 20 years, the U.S. dollar is going downhill," Xia predicted. "But the dollar may still strengthen in the short-term as people want to hedge risks. That's because there are flaws in the international monetary system and the dollar is the main currency," he said. Xia played down near-term risks to China's dollar holdings from a possible downgrade of U.S. credit rating if President Barack Obama and Republican congressional leaders cannot forge a compromise to raise the country's debt ceiling by early August. Moody's Investors Service has warned the United States may lose its top credit rating in the coming weeks if the $14.3 trillion limit on America's borrowing was not raised, meaning it could default on some obligations and not pay its bills. Republicans have demanded $2.4 trillion in spending cuts in return for supporting a rise in the debt limit, while Democrats and Obama insist on closing tax loopholes for the wealthy as part of a deal. "Will the United States collapse? I don't think the problem will blow up any time soon," Xia said. "The problem is that the United States wants to pursue a loose policy. The two U.S. parties are locked up a fight (over debt), but I think they will reach a compromise eventually." (Editing by  Ken Wills )
