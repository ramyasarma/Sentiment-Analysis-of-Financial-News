 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc said John Malone's Liberty Media Corp has proposed buying the largest U.S. bookstore chain for $1.02 billion. 

 Liberty Media has offered $17 per share, a 20.5 percent premium over Barnes & Noble's closing share price on Thursday. Barnes & Noble said the offer has not yet been evaluated by its special committee. Barnes & Noble put itself up for sale last August saying its shares were undervalued. The company, which operates 720 bookstores, as well as a chain of college campus stores, has been facing declining print book sales. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
