 LONDON  (Reuters) - An Abu Dhabi investment vehicle sold an 11 percent stake in  British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) for about 3.5 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) on Tuesday, to reap a near 1.5 billion profit in just seven months. 

 Barclays raised over 12 billion pounds in a series of deals last year to boost its capital without having to take rescue funds from the British government: OCT/NOV 2008: Barclays raised 7 billion pounds from investors from Qatar, Abu Dhabi and elsewhere through a range of capital instruments. -- Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's royal family, paid up to 4.75 billion pounds for capital instruments that could give him a 16 percent stake. At the time he said it was a personal investment, but it was later transferred to International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC). It included 2 billion pounds of mandatorily convertible notes (MCNs) paying 9.75 percent interest until converted into 1.3 billion shares at around 153 pence by the end of June. It also included 1.25 billion pounds of reserve capital instruments (RCIs) which pay annual interest of 14 percent, and 1.5 billion of warrants that convert at around 198 pence. -- Barclays raised up to 3.25 billion pounds from Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. It included 1.75 billion pounds in MCNs and 1.5 billion of warrants, which could leave the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) with a stake of just over 12 percent after it also invested in June 2008. -- Challenger, an investment vehicle of a member of Qatar's royal family, paid 300 million pounds to potentially give it a 2.8 percent stake. -- Existing investors bought 1.25 billion pounds of MCNs. SEPT 2008: Barclays raised 700 million pounds from a share placing and investors agreed to inject 600 million into the bank alongside its purchase of Lehman Brothers assets. JULY 2008: Barclays raised 4.5 billion pounds, mostly from Qatari and Asian investors after existing investors balked at the chance to buy shares at 282 pence each. -- Existing investors bought 19 percent of the shares offered, leaving most shares in the hands of a group of investors who had "anchored" the fundraising. -- Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and a member of Qatar's ruling family paid about 1.8 billion pounds for shares. -- China Development Bank, which reports directly to the State Council of China, invested about 136 million pounds to maintain a stake it took the previous year. It now holds just over 2 percent. -- Singapore's Temasek TEM.UL bought a stake in 2007 and invested up to 200 million pounds in July. Its stake is now estimated at just below 2 percent. -- Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. ( 8316.T ) invested 500 million pounds at 296 pence per share, which gave it about a 2 percent stake at the time. In July 2007, China Development Bank invested 1.5 billion pounds and Temasek invested 1 billion in Barclays at 720 pence per share. (Compiled by Steve Slater; Editing by Dan Lalor)
