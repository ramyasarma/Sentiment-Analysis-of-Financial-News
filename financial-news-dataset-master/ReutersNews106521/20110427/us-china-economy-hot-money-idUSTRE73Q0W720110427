 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China is increasingly a magnet for speculative funds due to entrenched investor expectations for a firmer yuan and its relatively high interest rates, a senior official warned on Wednesday. 

 But making clear that China will do its best to staunch hot money inflows and prevent them from fanning inflation, Li Chao, a deputy governor at China's currency regulator -- the State Administration of Foreign Exchange -- said all irregular capital flows would be closely monitored. China is concerned hot money adds to an already-bulging pool of excess cash in its economy, fuelling inflation currently at 32-month highs. Ever-buoyant demand for loans from Chinese firms will also drive the rush of speculative funds, Li was reported as saying in the official China Securities Journal. In the long run, however, Li noted that China can only tackle its excess money problem by liberalizing its capital account and allowing cash to flow out, a process he said should be sped up by reforming the yuan to make it convertible. Beijing has vowed to liberalize its capital account and allow cash to flow out more easily, in part to slow the pace of build-up in its $3.05 trillion foreign exchange reserves that is aggravating inflation woes. But in characteristic Chinese fashion, the government will only carry out reforms in a "gently gently" manner for fear that any big changes could destabilize the financial system and the economy.
