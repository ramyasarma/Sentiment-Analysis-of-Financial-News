 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China has threatened to impose price controls after soaring food costs pushed inflation to its highest in more than two years, but monetary tightening may be more effective in getting at the root of the problem. 

 Here are some questions and answers about inflation in China, which has fueled public anger with the ruling Communist Party in the past. IS INFLATION OUT OF CONTROL? Far from it. Consumer inflation, which rose 4.4 percent in the year to October, is still well below levels in early 2008. Beijing showed then that it can bring prices under control with concerted tightening. What concerns Beijing now is the sudden and unexpected jump in prices. Officials had long said that inflation would recede at the end of this year. Just the opposite seems to be happening. The risk is that inflationary expectations could come unhinged if the government was seen to be sitting on its hands. The measures announced Wednesday aim to counter that perception -- they show that officials are aware of popular frustration over food prices and are ready to take serious action, if necessary. WHAT ELSE WILL CHINA DO? With Beijing's focus squarely on inflation, support is swinging to the more hawkish camp of policymakers who advocate more monetary tightening. Tightening to date has been gradual, with just one interest rate rise and gradual yuan appreciation. Market jitters over the past two weeks have centered on the prospect of another interest rate increase. While that is likely, most analysts think the government will focus on pulling cash out of the economy. Required reserves for big banks are already at a record high, and are likely to move higher still. The government may also lower the official target for new loans from 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) this year to 7 trillion yuan next year. To help stave off imported inflation, Beijing could let the yuan rise about 5 percent against the dollar next year. WHERE IS CHINA'S INFLATION COMING FROM? Food prices are leading Chinese inflation. Accounting for about a third of the consumer price index, food costs rose 10.1 percent in the year to October, while non-food inflation crept up just 1.6 percent. It is therefore tempting to dismiss concerns about inflation by noting that pressures are not broad based. That would be a mistake. In contrast to 2007 when pork production plummeted because of blue-ear pig disease, there has been no major supply shock this time around. Instead, the main source of upward pressure on food prices is much the same as that in the frothy property market: a vast pool of domestic liquidity. Liquidity has an outsized impact on food prices because agriculture is the one sector of the Chinese economy where supply is tight and there is no over-capacity to ease inflation. WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF CHINA'S LIQUIDITY? To hear it from many Chinese officials, the blame lies with the loose monetary policies of developed economies that are propelling cash toward emerging markets. But excess liquidity in China has a decidedly domestic provenance. First, despite steps toward policy normalization, Beijing has moved slowly to control money growth. The People's Bank of China noted in a report last month that a record lending binge during the global financial crisis was still driving a rise in the country's money supply. Second, for all of Beijing's talk about hot money, most cash comes through ordinary trade channels rather than via the hands of shadowy speculators. To hold its exchange rate down, Beijing prints vast amounts of yuan to buy up the foreign exchange streaming in. The rising trade surplus has combined with the tightly controlled currency regime to foster the creation of high-powered base money. WHAT ABOUT SPECULATIVE INFLOWS AND CAPITAL CONTROLS? While not the cause of China's excess liquidity, speculative inflows threaten to add to the problem. Despite China's tight capital controls, the country's extensive trade and investment links with the rest of the world leave plenty of loopholes. A recent rise in foreign exchange reserves not attributable to trade and investment suggests that inflows are indeed climbing. A widening interest rate differential over the United States, yuan appreciation and buoyant property and stock markets give speculators reason to try to pierce China's controls. The government has already cracked down on foreign borrowing by domestic banks and will take more steps to curb inflows. COULD THERE BE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FALLOUT? Plenty of Chinese consumers grumble about higher food prices, but the strains have not been enough to unleash unrest. Many have made income gains in recent years that offset price rises. Still memories are fresh of the late 1980s. In 1988 annual CPI jumped 18.8 percent, adding to discontent in the build-up to widespread anti-government protests in 1989. That fear may spur the government to take firmer action. "Throughout the decades of my political career, I have learnt that two issues can undermine social stability, or even the steadfastness of state power. One is corruption, the other is prices," Premier Wen Jiabao, who was a central government aide in the late 1980s, said in February. (Additional reporting by Chris Buckley and Sally Huang.
