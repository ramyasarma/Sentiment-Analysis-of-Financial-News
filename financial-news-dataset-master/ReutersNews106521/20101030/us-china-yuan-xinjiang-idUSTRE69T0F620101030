 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China will let some cross-border investment flows in the far western region of Xinjiang be settled in yuan, the country's first such trial after a scheme for yuan trade settlement was expanded this year, the Xinhua news agency said. 

 The experiment marks the latest step by authorities to give the yuan a greater role internationally as it gradually lifts the capital controls that are at the heart of debate about the currency's value. Xinhua cited Hu Xiaolian, vice governor of the central bank, as telling a launch ceremony for the project in regional capital Urumqi that it was aimed at mitigating foreign exchange risks and fostering Xinjiang's economic ties with neighboring countries, which include Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Russia. Beijing has announced a series of policies this year to fuel more economic growth for the restive but resource-rich region, including ordering banks to provide more credit to the region and cutting corporate income taxes. Xinjiang may now also take part in the yuan trade settlement program, Xinhua said. Yuan trade settlement has taken off in recent months after an initially slow start, as Beijing has allowed for the currency to be used for more investment products offshore, especially in Hong Kong. The lack of such uses for yuan held offshore had been the main factor constraining the program's growth. That opening has prompted such interest that Hong Kong's central bank this week had to step in to settle trade-related yuan transactions, after the sole lender authorized to clear such trades between Hong Kong and mainland China ran out of its quota for the year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it had activated a swap line with the People's Bank of China to clear currency transactions tied to exports and imports after the Bank of China (Hong Kong) ( 2388.HK ) suddenly used up its 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) quota.
