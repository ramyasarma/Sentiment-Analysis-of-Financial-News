 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks and commodity prices recovered on Tuesday from the previous session's sell-off, which was prompted by concerns over the pace of global recovery, while the Japanese yen and safe-haven U.S. government bonds eased. 

 U.S. stocks suffered their worst loss in seven weeks on Monday while Chinese shares saw their biggest daily percentage drop in nine months. The Shanghai Composite Index  .SSEC  ended 1.4 percent higher on Tuesday, reversing earlier losses after dipping to a two-month low in intraday trade. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  also closed up. U.S. stock index futures rose 0.6-0.7 percent, pointing to a stronger start on Wall Street, as investors braced for data on new housing starts. The drop in China's market had a domino effect on other markets on Monday, fuelling worries among some analysts that rallying assets prices have run too far ahead of economic fundamentals and weak earnings prospects. "Most economies appear to have exited recession, thanks to a turn in the inventory cycle and huge policy stimulus," Barclays Wealth said in a note. "However, a sustained recovery will require greater spending from households and corporations. For this to occur, greater confidence among lenders and borrowers will be necessary." The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index, which tumbled 45 percent last year, has rallied nearly 44 percent from its March floor and is up more than 11 percent this year. The index rose 1 percent on Tuesday, boosted by a survey which showed a bigger-than-expected improvement in Germany investor sentiment. GERMAN SENTIMENT IMPROVES The ZEW economic research institute's economic sentiment index for Germany rose to 56.1 in August from 39.5 in July, taking the indicator to its highest level since April 2006. "We have passed the low point of the crisis. We are at the start of a recovery which will, however, turn out to be rather bumpy and weak," said Joerg Lueschow at WestLB. "The economy might grow more strongly in the third quarter than in the spring. But in the fourth quarter, momentum might flag again, as increasing unemployment puts a dampener on consumption." Nokia's ( NOK1V.HE ) Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo also said he expected a slow, gradual recovery in the world economy. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS advanced 0.3 percent after losing nearly 3 percent on Monday -- its biggest one-day percentage loss in four months. The euro gained against the dollar and the yen, lifted by the ZEW data. The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.4119. Against the yen, the euro rose 1 percent to 134.26 yen. The VDAX-NEW volatility index .V1XI, a gauge of investor risk aversion in Europe, fell 3.4 percent, after soaring 14 percent to hit its highest close in five weeks on Monday. The higher the volatility index, the lower is investors' appetite for risky assets such as equities. Crude prices rose above $67 a barrel and copper prices gained 1.4 percent as investors regained a bit of risk appetite. Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were up 4 basis points at 3.507 percent, while the 10-year euro zone Bund yield was up 1 basis point at 3.308 percent.
