 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) plans to spend $2.4 billion on capital improvements in 2010 as it continues to revamp restaurants and expand in emerging markets, the world's largest restaurant company said on Thursday.

The company plans to open more restaurants with drive-throughs, which cost more, but have higher returns, The company plans to open 150-175 restaurants in China and 40 in Russia, both fast-growing emerging markets. The capital spending is an increase from 2009, the world's largest restaurant operator said in a presentation to analysts, though it did not say what the 2009 amount was. The company also said it continues to exceed its long-term targets of 3 percent to 5 percent annual sales growth and 6 percent to 7 percent operating income growth, excluding currency fluctuations. The company said currency fluctuations will add 10 cents to 13 cents to 2010 earnings, based on current exchange rates.
