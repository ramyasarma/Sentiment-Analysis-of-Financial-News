 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output grew for a fifth month in July as global stimulus spending boosted export demand and manufacturers forecast the sector would gain momentum through the quarter. 

 A survey of purchasing managers also showed manufacturing activity at its strongest in nearly three years, but analysts warned against reading too much in to the data saying the effect of stimulus after the global financial crisis would peter out next year. Factory output rose 1.9 percent in July, beating the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 1.4 percent, but slowing from a 2.3 percent gain in June. Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said they expected output to rise 2.4 percent in August and 3.2 percent in September. "Car makers and electronics makers are increasing production as they have worked off inventories," said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research. "That is now spilling over to material sectors. The rise in output is broadening." The Nomura/JMMA Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.6 in August, the highest level since November 2006, from 50.4 in July. The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the second month in a row. "The index's improvement suggests that the rebound in manufacturing is gaining momentum," said Minoru Nogimori, an economist at Nomura Securities. The index for new export orders rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.2 in August from 52.7 in July, also the seventh month of improvement, thanks to stronger demand from China. However, the rise slowed to 0.5 point from 1.5 points in July. "Exports may be losing momentum," Nogimori said. "We will have to focus on new export orders increasingly as one of the most important indicators regarding the outlook for Japan's economy." Industrial output grew 8.3 percent in April-June after falling a record 22.1 percent in the previous quarter, helping the economy return to growth in the second quarter following the deepest and longest recession since World War Two. "Current output growth is led by one-off factors and the capacity utilization rate remains low, so a slowdown is anticipated toward the end of this year and early next year and the downtrend may be exacerbated by weak domestic demand in the face of the worsening job situation." said Hiroshi Shiraishi, economist at BNP Paribas.
