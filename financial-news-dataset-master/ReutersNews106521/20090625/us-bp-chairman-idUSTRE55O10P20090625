 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) said its chief executive, Carl-Henric Svanberg, was stepping down to become chairman of BP Plc ( BP.L ) in a surprise appointment that ends the oil major's fraught search for a successor to Peter Sutherland. 

 Svanberg's replacement at the Swedish telecoms equipment firm will be its chief financial officer Hans Vestberg, who said he planned no major strategic changes. Analysts welcomed Vestberg's promotion. BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward told Reuters Europe's second-largest oil company by market value would benefit from Svanberg's experience in emerging markets and in dealing with governments. Svanberg, who has been CEO at Ericsson since 2003, will take over from Sutherland next January in what will be his first oil industry role. Svanberg led a successful turnaround of the then loss-making Ericsson, slashing jobs and costs, and then built it into one of the strongest companies in the sector, analysts said. However, a profit-warning in 2007 shortly after the company made bullish comments to analysts, dented confidence in Svanberg and his management team. "(His departure) has been pretty much rumored for the past year and a half, since the 2007 profit warning. Meanwhile Hans Vestberg has proven himself a sensible CFO," Alexander Peterc, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said. Ericsson shares were down 2.0 percent at 75.20 Swedish crowns at 10:55 a.m. EDT, compared to a 1.2 percent decline in the DJ Stoxx European telecom equipment makers index .SX8P. BP shares were down 1.1 percent at 471-3/4 pence, compared to a 1.5 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European oil and gas sector index .SXEP. STRATEGIC CHALLENGES Svanberg will join BP as the company advances its own turnaround, cutting jobs and costs, under Hayward, who took up his job in 2007. After overhauling what he said was an overly-complex management structure, Hayward is now focused on rolling back big rises in industry costs, which doubled since 2004, as crude soared to a record above $147/barrel last year. The company also faces challenges in accessing reserves and has been hit hard by the collapse in crude prices, although Hayward said the company's financial performance was now "back on track." Hayward plans to make use of Svanberg's experience in dealing with governments. Governments are big buyers of telecoms equipment, while regulatory issues are also a big driver for the sector. As governments award oil and gas licenses, and decide taxes, good government relations are similarly essential for oil companies. Svanberg's emerging markets knowledge is also expected to help as BP shifts the focus of its refining and marketing business toward Asia. "In downstream, the challenge is how to reposition the capital employed from the mature markets into the immature, growing markets and that's something that the telecoms industry has managed to do very successfully over the last decade or so," Hayward told Reuters in a telephone interview. "In terms of managing that transition, I think Carl-Henric will have a hell of a lot to offer." BP's larger rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) also tapped the telecoms sector when its chairmanship came up for grabs, appointing Nokia Chief Executive Jorma Ollila in 2006. FRAUGHT RECRUITMENT Svanberg's appointment ends a fraught recruitment process. Outgoing BP chairman Sutherland had expected to stand down late last year or earlier this year, and BP initially selected miner Rio Tinto's ( RIO.AX ) then chairman Paul Skinner, a former Shell executive, to fill the job. However, Skinner withdrew following investor unease over Rio's plan to sell $19.5 billion in assets and bonds to Chinese state-owned aluminum group Chinalco, BP sources said. Skinner stepped down from his Rio role in March and earlier this month Rio dropped the Chinalco deal. That reverse poisoned the BP role for some potential candidates, especially UK businessmen, some executives said, and limited the options open to the company, which had hoped to select someone with oil industry experience. Sutherland was a popular chairman, whose previous experience as an European Union Commissioner and head of the World Trade Organization brought BP valuable international contacts. His tenure is best remembered for a spat with former CEO John Browne, over Browne's desire to extend his role beyond BP's normal retirement age of 60 years. Svanberg will join the BP board in September and, once he becomes chairman, will be based in London and devote the majority of his time to BP business, BP said. He will also remain on the Ericsson board. Vestberg told a press conference he felt well prepared for the top job at Ericsson, having worked in most parts of the business, which is focused on making mobile phone networks. The company also provides telecoms services such as consulting and co-owns the world's no.4 handset maker, Sony Ericsson, with Japan's Sony Corp ( 6758.T ). The company is one of Sweden's top blue chip performers, rising almost 30 percent this year. In the past year it has risen 12 per cent, outperforming a 14.6 percent fall in the broader index.
