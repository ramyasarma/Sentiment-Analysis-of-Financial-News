 NEW YORK/ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - Factory activity improved around the world last month and U.S. consumer spending accelerated in August, but policymakers were divided about when to withdraw emergency measures because of uncertainty over a recovery. 

 Governments around the world have poured trillions into the economy and cut interest rates to historic lows to forestall an even deeper crisis, and the latest economic data suggests these measures have started to pay off. The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday raised its outlook for the world economy next year, forecasting growth of 3.1 percent, up from an earlier estimate of 2.5 percent. But it stressed that states should not rush to withdraw emergency funding and should stand ready to roll out new initiatives if risk to growth emerges. Indeed, while signs of improvement abound, data suggests that recovery could easily fizzle out. A report on Thursday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in September for a second straight month but at a slower pace than economists expected. That pushed U.S. stock prices down by more than 1 percent and enhanced the appeal of safe-haven U.S. government debt. And while U.S. consumer spending jumped 1.3 percent in August, its biggest increase in nearly eight years, the U.S. Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose last week. The jobless numbers took some shine off the consumer data, as spending is likely to be anemic while jobs remain scarce. "The labor markets remain the weak link in this recovery process," said Kevin Flanagan, fixed income strategist for global wealth management at Morgan Stanley. "It will be a while before they provide any kind of support, especially to consumer spending." More encouraging was a 6.4 percent rise in pending sales of existing U.S. homes in August, based on contracts signed, according to the National Association of Realtors. POLICYMAKERS DILEMMA Government and central bank officials around the world continue to debate the proper timing for higher interest rates and tighter fiscal policy. Euro zone finance ministers meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden, were split on the subject, with some ready to say 2011 would be the starting point for ending emergency stimulus. The European Commission has said most European Union countries should start cutting their ballooning budget deficits from 2011 to prevent debt from spiraling out of control. "Every country will have to define its exit strategy in its own due time. I don't think that we can have a precise, or a common, schedule," Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said. Indeed, recovery still looks fragile in many major economies. Manufacturing activity surged across Asia last month and contracted less sharply than first thought across the euro zone, with German factories nearly returning to growth and French activity also accelerating, [ID:nL1484335] But euro zone unemployment rose to 9.6 percent in August, surpassing July's 10-year high of 9.5 percent, and German retail sales fell 1.5 percent in August. "Job losses were widespread as firms struggled with the resulting squeeze on profit margins, highlighting the fragility of the recovery," said Chris Williamson at Markit. Underscoring that issue, the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showed big manufacturers plan to cut capital spending by a record 25.6 percent in the fiscal year through March 31, more than indicated in a June survey. Capital spending has typically been a growth driver for Japan's economy, but is now one of its weakest links as firms cut expenditure to protect fragile profits. ASIA'S ASCENT But the silver lining in the global growth story still appears to be in Asia, where factories in China, South Korea and India ramped up production last month as new orders from home and abroad rose. Also, Japanese construction equipment maker Komatsu Ltd had a sharp rise in sales to China. The IMF cited a rebound in Asia for its sunnier outlook. It sees the world economy contracting 1.1 percent in 2009, up from a July forecast of 1.4 percent, with activity being "pulled up by the strong performance of Asian economies," it said.
