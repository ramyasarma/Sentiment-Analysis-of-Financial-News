 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp is set to resume negotiations with the United Auto Workers union this week and believes everything should be open for discussion, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 "I'm encouraged to reengage with the UAW at the bargaining table. I'm one of those people who believes that everything should be on the table" so long as it leads to GM's viability, Fritz Henderson told reporters after meeting with congressional officials. GM, a recipient of $15 billion in federal bailout funds, is up against a government-imposed June 1 deadline to cut debt, reach union concessions and restructure its operations or face likely bankruptcy. Henderson said if GM were to seek Chapter 11 protection, like its rival Chrysler LLC did last week, the matter would be handled as expeditiously as possible. Chrysler hopes to step out of bankruptcy within 60 days. Although Henderson cited some similarities between restructuring efforts at Chrysler and his company, the two have different challenges. "My business card doesn't say Chrysler," Henderson said. "We'll deal with the realities of General Motors." Retiree health care and UAW concerns about GM's restructuring proposal, specifically about plans for overseas vehicle production, would be key topics for discussion with the UAW. "You have to listen to each side to find common ground. That's what we'll do," said Henderson, who took over the top job at GM just over a month ago. The UAW wants the government to reject GM's latest restructuring plan, saying it would cut domestic factory jobs and clear the way for increased imports from plants in Mexico, South Korea and China. On healthcare, Henderson said Chrysler's deal with the union on restructuring payments on retiree health care was similar in design to what GM wants to do to help restructure its own debt. Henderson said the U.S. Treasury was continuing to review its business plan, which includes a proposed bond exchange to reduce $28 billion in debt. "The Treasury will continue their evaluation through the month, which is fine. But we're not waiting, we're implementing. The bond exchange needed to be launched when we launched it," Henderson said. "Now we'll have to see." GM bondholders believe it has a small chance to succeed in a way that would avoid bankruptcy. GM shares gained 3 cents, or 1.65 percent, to close at $1.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by John Crawley and Kim Dixon; Editing Bernard Orr)
