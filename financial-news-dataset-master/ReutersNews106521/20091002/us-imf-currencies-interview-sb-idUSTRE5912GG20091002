 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund does not think the world's major trading currencies are at levels that would threaten the global economic recovery, a senior IMF official said on Friday, brushing aside European concerns about the strength of the euro. 

 "What we find today among the major traded currencies is that, in broad multilateral, effective terms, inflation-adjusted terms, for the major traded currencies there does not appear to be a problem in restoring and sustaining growth," First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky told Reuters financial television. He was speaking on the sidelines of IMF meetings in Istanbul, and on the eve of talks there among finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven club of wealthy economies. Earlier in the day, IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn repeated that the IMF still believed the Chinese yuan, which is closely controlled by Beijing, was undervalued. But Lipsky's remarks suggested the IMF would not lend its weight to any proposal for an adjustment of exchange rates among the world's major, freely traded currencies. His remarks contrasted with statements in recent days by European, particularly French officials, who have said strength of the euro against the dollar could damage Europe's recovery by stifling its exports. The euro is up about 16 percent since March. "It is out of the question that the euro pays the bill for an adjustment between the dollar and the yuan," French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Thursday. On Friday, she said she hoped the currency issue would be discussed in Istanbul. FUTURE MOVES Asked about the Europeans' complaints, Lipsky said: "We don't take views on bilateral pairs, but on a trade-weighted, inflation-adjusted basis, there aren't substantial deviations from what we'd see as consistent with long-term equilibrium. "I suspect what we're talking about is worries of potential moves in the future that could cause problems, and that's exactly what this new framework of collaboration is designed to avoid." He was referring to a pledge by world leaders in Pittsburgh last month to cooperate to reduce imbalances in the global economy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Thursday repeated that a strong dollar was very important to the United States. European officials had been pressing him to make that statement, in order to reduce the risk of currency markets pushing the dollar down further. Lipsky stressed, however, that factors other than exchange rates were crucial to ensuring a sustained recovery of the global economy. "What's clear is that to restore and sustain growth, there will have to be a relative shift in the primary sources of growth of the major economies. Currency is only one aspect." U.S. growth is set to depend more on exports from now on as domestic consumption wanes, so countries have to work together to ensure a rebalancing between those with trade surpluses such as China and those with deficits such as the United States, Lipsky said. "China has spoken out quite clearly in this regard, on both the need for collective action, the need to produce better balance and the need to produce sustained growth. "And you've seen the other actions the Chinese have taken over the past year to stimulate their economy have focused particularly on stimulating domestic demand."
