 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China on Thursday raised mortgage rates and down payment requirements to cool the red-hot property market, addressing what the government has described as one of the country's most pressing economic problems. 

 The cabinet announced a series of steps to make it harder, and more expensive, for people to take out mortgages on investment properties. Owner-occupiers buying larger homes are also targeted. After a meeting chaired by Premier Wen Jiabao, the State Council said property and land prices were rising too fast in some cities, making it difficult for Chinese people to buy a home and also increasing financial risks. "We must take more restrictive and forceful measures," it said as it announced the following main steps: -- The down payment on second homes rises to 50 percent from 40 percent; -- Banks must charge a minimum mortgage rate on second homes of 1.1 times the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Banks currently have flexibility on the rates they charge depending on their assessment of credit risk. -- Down payments and mortgage rates on third and subsequent properties will be even higher. -- The down payment on first homes of more than 90 square meters rises to 30 percent from 20 percent. "This will have an immediate impact on speculative house buyers," said Huang Qinglin, a property analyst with Great Wall Securities in Shenzhen, who described the measures as the harshest on record. The curbs would put a lid on China's property prices, but they were unlikely to trigger a sharp drop, he said. "You know, many house speculators have plenty of cash and don't rely too much on bank money, and it takes time for the supply of housing to increase," Huang said. FAST-RISING PRICES The tightening comes on the heels of an acceleration in urban property inflation to 11.7 percent in the year to March from February's 10.7 percent reading. Economists believe the official figures grossly understate the extent of price rises, especially in major cities. "These measures will definitely drive down transaction volumes. They may also push prices down as well," said Li Jianfeng, a property analyst with Shanghai Securities. He saw the move as part of China's efforts to nip inflation in the bud. The steps are also pre-emptive in nature, he noted, as China plans to raise the weighting of rental costs in its CPI basket next year from 14 percent now. The announcement is the latest salvo by Beijing in a campaign to restrict credit and reduce speculation in the property market. But Brian Jackson, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong, said the leap in prices suggested that Chinese homebuyers have not yet got the official message. "The additional measures announced today suggest policymakers remain reluctant to use the blunt instrument of higher interest rates, but it is unlikely that extra fine-tuning will be enough to slow down the property market and reduce overheating risks. "At some stage, Beijing will need to raise the cost of financing to have a real impact, and we expect to see moves in this direction in the next few months," he said in a note. The cabinet said it would increase the supply of land in cities where property prices are rising fast as a way to boost the availability of affordable housing. It said property developers found to be hoarding land would not be allowed to buy new parcels of land. They will also be denied access to public financing and new bank credit. David Ng, a property analyst with Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong, said it remained to be seen whether Thursday's steps would work. RBS downgraded the property sector earlier in the day from overweight to neutral in anticipation of further mortgage tightening. "It all boils down to how local authorities implement, whether there is any grey area and how they are going to define second home buyers. Of course, it's negative for the stocks,' he said. \ (Additional reporting by Zhou Xin in Beijing and Lee Chyen Yee in Hong Kong; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
