 PARIS  (Reuters) - Italian defense company Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ) said its order backlog was helping shield it from the economic downturn and U.S. defense spending was holding up despite cuts to big-ticket programs. 

 DRS, the U.S. defense technology company which Finmeccanica acquired last year to gain a foothold in the world's biggest defense market, has already racked up orders worth $2 billion in the first five months of the year, the company said on Monday. "U.S. defense spending remains very stable if you look beyond the big programs," Finmeccanica Chief Operating Officer Giorgio Zappa told reporters at the Paris Air Show, saying demand in the logistics and systems segment of the U.S. market remained strong despite the crisis. Despite its growing presence in the United States, which has become Finmeccanica's second-largest market after Italy, Finmeccanica has suffered setbacks on major contracts such as the U.S. presidential helicopter and the C-27J cargo plane. Finmeccanica's helicopter unit chief, Giuseppe Orsi, brushed off a potential threat from helicopter maker Sikorsky over the presidential helicopter after reports it had offered to join with the Italian company's partner Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ). "We have no reason to believe that Lockheed does not want to respect the agreements," Orsi told reporters, adding he did not believe there was an alternative for the next 10 years to its proposed VH-71 helicopter. Finmeccanica intends to stick to its plans to set up an assembly line in the United States for the C-27J, despite the Pentagon's decision to halve the contract and buy 38 planes instead of the 78 initially planned, Zappa said. Overall, the company was feeling the pinch from the recession only in the civil aircraft and helicopter segments, thanks to a backlog in orders from governments and other institutional clients, CEO Pierfrancesco Guarguaglini said. He said comments by governments and meida reports suggested Italy was seeing the first positive signals in the general economic climate, but Zappa warned signs of recovery in the civil aircraft market had yet to be seen. "Despite all these market turbulences, we will continue to push forward," said Guarguaglini. Finmeccanica's helicopter unit AgustaWestland on Monday announced orders worth 150 million euros ($208.2 million), saying the bulk of them were chalked up in China, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and the United States. Finmeccanica also said it expected to get good news this week on a contract for M346 training jets from the Italian armed forces, but did not say how much the contract could be worth. The company also confirmed it plans to sell its remaining 3.2 percent stake in chipmaker STMicroelectronics NV ( STM.PA ). Finmeccanica shares were down 0.3 percent, while STMicroelectronics shares were down nearly 7 percent. (Editing by  James Regan  and  David Holmes )
