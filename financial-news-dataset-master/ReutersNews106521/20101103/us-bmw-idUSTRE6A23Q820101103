 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's biggest luxury carmaker, disappointed investors with a conservative 2010 target for its core auto business which is benefiting from booming sales in China. 

 BMW raised its target for auto earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) equivalent to more than 7 percent of revenue this year from the 5 percent-plus aimed for in August. But that was still less than the average forecast of 7.4 percent in a Reuters poll of analysts. BMW shares were trading down 0.7 percent at 1240 GMT, making it one of the biggest underperformers among German blue chips  .GDAXI . China has proven a crucial driver to BMW's results, with the luxury car market doubling this year amid a sales mix that is tilted toward large, powerful, high-margin models packed with expensive options. "BMW's Q3 numbers confirm our view that the luxury auto segment has entered a new phase of profitability and that near double-digit margins were not just a peak in Q2 but a sign of a change in underlying profitability," Barclays Capital analyst Kristina Church wrote. "We still believe that BMW is the best positioned luxury auto name in terms of cost saving potential, model mix and China exposure to continue to post positive earnings momentum through to 2012," she added. The third-quarter EBIT margin at BMW's car business came in just ahead of forecasts at 8.1 percent, but was substantially weaker than the near 11.2 percent at Audi ( VOWG_p.DE ) or even the 9.5 percent at Mercedes ( DAIGn.DE ) -- which raised its earnings outlook for the third time last week. Analysts said there was little likelihood they would increase their earnings estimates on BMW's conservative full-year outlook. "New guidance for 2010 is still below ... our margin expectations of 7.5 percent for the automobile division," said analyst Michael Punzet at DZ Bank. In October, BMW group head of sales Ian Robertson forecast volumes will grow at least 10 percent in the fourth quarter, implying 2010 sales of just over 1.44 million vehicles -- the second highest figure on record after 1.50 million in the boom year of 2007.
