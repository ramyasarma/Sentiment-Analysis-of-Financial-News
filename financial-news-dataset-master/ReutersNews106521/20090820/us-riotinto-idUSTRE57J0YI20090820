 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto, the world's second-largest miner, positioned itself for a comeback on Thursday after posting a record drop in half-year profit and selling off shares and assets to slash debt. 

 Rio said it was more confident about the future after cutting a greater-than-targeted 16,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce, reducing production at its higher cost operations and paying off almost 40 percent of its debt. A key remaining challenge for Rio Tinto, however, is to resolve a stalemate with Chinese steel mills on price talks for iron ore, its biggest earner, amid tension with the Chinese government over the arrest of four staff in Shanghai on suspicion of bribery. Chief Executive Tom Albanese told reporters he didn't want to say anything that would adversely affect the four. "Rio Tinto is now a stronger, fitter business and we can now look to the future with a higher level of confidence," he said. "The worst is definitely over, just from where their debt position has come from and where it is today ... and where commodity prices have moved," said Tim Schroeders, a portfolio manager with Pengana Capital. "The group has a lot more flexibility in being able to adjust to whatever market conditions confront it in the future." First-half underlying profit fell 54 percent to $2.565 billion, matching analysts' forecasts, as metals prices and demand collapsed. Its aluminum business, which it expanded two years ago with the costly takeover of Alcan, slid to a loss of $689 million. Rio Tinto, which lightened its debt burden with recent asset sales and a $15.2 billion share sale, said cost cuts would pay off in the second half and, in a sign of its confidence, said it expected to pay a final dividend. Albanese said he expected some recovery in western demand in 2010. Rising demand from China, the biggest consumer of many industrial metals, had lifted metal prices from 2008 lows. "If current markets are any indication, I expect to see more stable and possibly stronger trading conditions in the second half," Albanese said. That echoed the outlook given last week by bigger rival and former suitor BHP Billiton after it announced its first profit decline in seven years. Rio shares were up 1.4 percent at 2,344 pence in London at 1231 GMT (8:31 a.m. EDT), underperforming the 2.6 percent rise in the UK mining index. MENDING CHINA FENCES Albanese said the staff detained in China were in good health, and Rio was relieved that the grounds for their arrest were not as serious as the spying allegations first made. Rio is continuing to sell iron ore to China, provisionally at the same price as agreed with Japanese mills, down 33 percent from last year, and production was running well ahead of last year, he said. "From an overall perspective, I am committed to building our relationship with China, which of course is of great importance to Rio Tinto," he added. Rio is still looking for more asset sales to boost a balance sheet damaged by the takeover of Alcan two years ago at the peak of the commodities boom. With the $2 billion sale of most of its remaining Alcan packaging businesses to Australia's Amcor Ltd agreed this week, Rio has passed the halfway mark on its target to sell $15 billion worth of assets in two years.

Albanese said Rio Tinto still sees opportunities to work with Chinalco and has had some early discussions with them. "I personally am interested in seeing that happen," he said.
