 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors had few places to hide on Friday as stocks, bonds, and commodities fell on fears China may raise interest rates while Ireland's dubious debt position forced European leaders to leap to Dublin's defense. 

 U.S. stocks snapped a five week winning streak, ending lower as commodity and energy shares took a beating on concerns that changes in Chinese monetary policy might slow the pace of its voracious appetite for raw materials. The euro was given a reprieve, rising from six-week lows as officials reiterated to bondholders they would not be forced to take losses in the event of a new euro zone bailout. "The fact that euro zone officials said Irish bond holders don't have to take a haircut on their existing positions is supportive for the euro," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange. U.S. Treasuries' prices fell sharply after the first day of purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve as part of its new $600 billion bond-buying program to stimulate the U.S. economy. The Fed bought $7.23 billion in Treasury paper maturing in four to six years on Friday. "Investors are trying to readjust rates to a better economic outlook and the prospect of no further QE after the current program of asset purchases," said Cary Leahey, economist at Decision Economics in New York. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury losses tripled after the results, falling a 45/32 of a point in price and pushing the yield to a two month high of 2.79 percent. Spot gold and crude oil prices suffered their biggest drop in a month, despite the U.S. dollar's weakness. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 90.52 points, or 0.80 percent, at 11,192.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 14.33 points, or 1.18 percent, at 1,199.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 37.31 points, or 1.46 percent, at 2,518.21. For the week, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 lost 2.1 percent while the Nasdaq lost 2.35 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closed down 0.43 percent at 1,103.99 points. Shanghai's stock market  .SSEC  suffered the worst loss in over 14 months after rumors swept through the market that further monetary tightening was imminent to stem rising Chinese prices, especially in the housing sector. "The whole commodity complex is exceptionally weak after the overnight action in China, and we need to see how it all plays out," said Tom Samuels, managing partner at Palantir Capital Management in Houston. "This may be the first seed of doubt about the healing power of (quantitative easing)." Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index  .N225  fell 1.4 percent from a 4-1/2 month closing high in the previous session. Looking broadly, the MSCI All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS fell 1.03 percent. RUMOR AND DENIAL Ireland's debt problems, much like the rest of peripheral Europe, are keeping investors on edge despite the denial from leaders that bondholders were at risk. Sources told Reuters on Friday that Ireland is in talks to tap emergency funds from the European Financial Stability Facility that would allow investors to avoid taking a loss on their investments. "The rumors that the EU may come out with a support package for Ireland have led to a bout of short-covering. Investors are very short Ireland," said Nick Stamenkovic, an interest rate strategist at RIA Capital Markets. "Most of the long-term players will just be sitting on the sidelines. There's so much volatility in the market, they don't want to get involved until the situation clarifies," he said. The premium demanded to hold Irish 10-year bonds over German bonds narrowed from record high levels. In the currency markets, the euro was up 0.22 percent at $1.3685 against the dollar, having earlier hit a six-week low of $1.3573 on EBS trading platform. The dollar cut its losses versus the yen, pulling just above even on the day at 82.54. Against major currencies, the greenback fell 0.09 percent at 78.15 .DXY. Crude oil settled down $2.93, to $84.88 per barrel. Spot gold prices lost $40.71 to $1368.19 an ounce.
