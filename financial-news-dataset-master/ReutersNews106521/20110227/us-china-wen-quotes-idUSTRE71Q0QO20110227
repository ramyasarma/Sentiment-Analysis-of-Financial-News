 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China must ward off threats to stability from price rises and pressure to sharply raise the yuan currency, Premier Wen Jiabao said on Sunday. 

 He was answering questions on an online forum about economic and social worries. Here are key comments from the online discussion, which was organized by China's official Xinhua news agency: PRICE RISES AND INFLATION "Rapid price rises have affected the public and even social stability. The Party and government have always made a priority of keeping prices at a generally stable level." "Our country has had seven successive years of bumper harvests, it has ample (grain) reserves, we have a robust material base and we have abundant foreign exchange reserves. These all offer favorable conditions for dealing with price rises." "There must be unwavering determination to contain investment and speculative demand in housing. We're adopting economic and legal measures, as well as when necessary administrative ones." "I'm confident that through our efforts, we'll see results in reining in speculative and investment purchases of housing." YUAN EXCHANGE RATE POLICY "The appreciation of the renminbi exchange rate is in keeping with our economic needs and also in keeping with the people's interests, but we have proposed that the appreciation must be kept gradual because of the features of our external trade, with 50 percent from processed trade and over 50 percent from foreign businesses or joint enterprises." The renminbi is another name for China's yuan currency. "Under these circumstances, the appreciation of the yuan must take into account the ability of businesses to cope and the impact on employment." "If the renminbi had a dramatic one-off revaluation, that would lead to many processing firms being left bankrupt or unable to do business. It would lead to orders from foreign trade companies shifting to other countries, and we would have many workers made unemployed, and most of these workers would rural migrant workers." Wen said of foreign critics: "Let them think about that. If businesses go bankrupt, workers become unemployed and rural migrant workers go home, then what do we have to expand domestic consumption, where will increased consumption come from?" "They may not know that now close to 50 percent of rural residents' income comes from wage income. That has been a major source of improving rural livelihoods in recent years -- 240 million farmers going to cities to work." "Therefore, we must certainly constantly advance renminbi exchange rate reform ... But we must be advance in a prudent, step-by-step, gradual way, so that our businesses can steadily adapt and overall social stability is maintained." ECONOMIC GROWTH GOALS "During the 12th Five-Year Plan, we have set economic growth at 7 percent (annually)." "We're doing this because we want to make the focus of our work improving the quality and benefits of economic growth. That is, we want to use the fruits of development on people's well-being. We absolutely must not any longer sacrifice the environment for the sake of rapid growth and reckless roll-outs. That will lead to production capacity gluts and deepening pressure on the environment and resources so that economic development will be unsustainable." (Editing by  Yoko Nishikawa )
