 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The prospective strength of the euro is a bit of a concern without being a worry, Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker told Reuters, but said there was no reason to change the existing G7 statement on currencies. 

 The Eurogroup comprises the euro zone's 16 finance ministers, the European Central Bank's President and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner. "We are a little bit concerned without being worried about the prospective level of the euro, we do think that others have to contribute to bringing down the existing global imbalances," Juncker told Reuters Television. In an interview before the start of the Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Istanbul, Juncker said, however, a change in the way the G7 talked about currencies could worry markets. "I don't think we will have dramatic changes to previous language, this would disturb the market and inspire them to bad conclusions. We have very good reasons to stick, in broad terms, to what we have said on previous occasions," Juncker said. He said the final statement would probably not be far from what the euro zone position on currencies was. "I don't think that the G7 communique will differ a lot from what we have previously said in Europe," he said. "As far as the euro zone is concerned we don't like excessive volatility of exchange rates, we do think exchange rates have to reflect economic fundamentals and we are welcoming the continuing commitment of China to have their monetary policy conducted in a more flexible way," Juncker said. While he would not directly comment on the level of the euro against the dollar or the yuan, he said Europeans liked the United States to say a strong dollar was in its interest. "As Europeans we have always insisted on the need, the self-recognized need, by the U.S. to have the strong dollar being in the best interest of the U.S. economy -- there is no reason to change this wording," Juncker said. The euro has appreciated 4.35 percent against the dollar so far this year, causing difficulties for euro zone exporters, who say the pain threshold for them is $1.4. The G7, which groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy is traditionally the forum at which global currency issues are discussed, but the absence of China at the table makes decision-making difficult.
