 LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc said visitors to its China search engine Google.cn are being redirected to the Hong Kong-based google.com.hk, following unsuccessful talks with the Chinese government about operating an uncensored search engine in the country. 

 COMMENTARY JAMES LEWIS, INTERNET SECURITY EXPERT, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, WASHINGTON "Neither side wants a crash and neither side is going to back down, so if this is a compromise that the Chinese can accept, then everybody is happy." COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC FINANCIAL "This is not the end of the saga, this is just the end of the chapter. "They're making China shut down Google.cn and by the same token, Google's out there saying, 'We expect Android to continue to flourish (in China) and we expect to keep running our R&D center,' and from our view, those expectations could be incorrect. "We don't see this as reducing tension, we see this as increasing or ratcheting up tension between the two parties. "You sort of make China look like the bad guy and you think you're going to be selling Google phones? Good luck, we'll see how that goes." JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT "I guess what they're trying to do is not give up the exposure to the growth in China, but at the same time not capitulate on a matter of principle." CLAYTON MORAN, STOCK ANALYST, THE BENCHMARK COMPANY "The next step will be for China to shut down access to those results for the Chinese residents. It's sort of expected and basically this means the end of Google's China search site. "It's another in a line of abandoned U.S. Internet initiatives in China. "It's not a meaningful loss to their current revenue base. It's about 1 percent of revenues, we believe. But it is a loss of potential growth down the line that really is unquantifiable today. "We don't see it as a dramatic loss for Google because today it's not that meaningful, and the future was pretty uncertain given the mixed -- at best -- record of American Internet companies in China." RICHARD FETYKO, ANALYST, MERRIMAN CURHAN FORD & CO "Sounds like they're going to lose the China revenues and they're willing to move forward with that kind of outcome. "I don't think the (Chinese) government's going to change its stance and it will more than likely block the site (Google.cn), and the redirecting is not going to help. "Google's lost revenue will be less than $1 billion and less than 5 percent of total net revenues, and investors have likely priced that into the stock. "The stock is worth more than the current share price, just with the markets that they're involved in outside of China." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT "Near-term, not that big a deal. Long-term, if this stays in place, it's a negative. China is certainly a great growth opportunity. Currently a small part of Google's revenue comes from China -- most estimates are in the 1 to 2 percent range -- but the long-term opportunity is significant. "Moving the platform to Hong Kong is not a total loss by any means. It will still be accessed, but it will be censored inside mainland China. "But over time, a lot could change. The Chinese government could liberalize and the censoring could stop. Nobody expects that right away, but things could change."
