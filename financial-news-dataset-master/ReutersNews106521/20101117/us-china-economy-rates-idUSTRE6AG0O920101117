 BEIJING  (Reuters) - The tendency of China's central bank to raise interest rates around the 20th day of the month makes this Friday a "sensitive window" for a rate rise, an official newspaper said on Wednesday, citing unnamed analysts. 

 The report in the China Securities Journal did not cite any officials and was based on a potentially flawed reading of the central bank's decision-making history. "The central bank mostly chooses Friday or someday around the 20th of a month to announce interest rate increases, so it is possibly a sensitive window this Friday," the article said. When China raised interest rates in October, it was the 19th of the month but a Tuesday. The five previous rate decisions were announced on the 22nd, 26th, 29th, 8th and 15th of their respective months -- and none were on a Friday. The analysts cited in the article based their logic on the fact that banks typically settle accumulated interest on the 20th day of the month. It would be convenient for lenders to make calculations if the central bank announced interest rate increases one day ahead of the settling date, they reasoned. Regardless of the specific timing, expectations have been building for another interest rate increase before the end of the year after consumer price inflation sped to a 25-month high in October. The Chinese stock market has dropped about 10 percent over the past five trading days on fears of more tightening. (Reporting by Aileen Wang and  Simon Rabinovitch ; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
