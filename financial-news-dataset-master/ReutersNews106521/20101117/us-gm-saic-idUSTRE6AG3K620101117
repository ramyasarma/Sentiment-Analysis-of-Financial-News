 DETROIT/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - China's government has not yet approved state-run automaker SAIC's plans to take a stake in General Motors Co GM.UL, making it uncertain whether the deal can be completed as part of the U.S. automaker's IPO, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 GM and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd ( 600104.SS ) have been in wide-ranging discussions since the summer on ways to expand their cooperation beyond the China market, where they are joint-venture partners, people with knowledge of those private talks have said. SAIC agreed in principle to invest between $500 million and $1 billion in GM, pending approval by China's Ministry of Commerce, those sources said. One person said that as of Tuesday, SAIC had still been planning on a 1 percent stake in GM. That would be worth more than $600 million because of the rising value of the U.S. automaker's IPO and the strong demand for its shares. But as of Wednesday, Beijing had not acted to approve the proposed investment, two people said. A Ministry of Commerce spokesman had no immediate comment. GM declined comment. SAIC representatives could not be immediately reached for comment. The reason for the delay in approval by Beijing was not clear, and it was not immediately known if approval from Chinese officials could still be won or if the proposed investment could be made in some altered form, said the sources. The people with knowledge of the discussions asked not to be named because the talks remain private. If SAIC were to drop out of the IPO, it would have little impact on the broad terms of GM's stock sale, according to people close to the deal. The prospect of investing in a potentially more profitable U.S. automaker has drawn strong interest from other institutional investors, they said. But the potential for SAIC to take a small stake in the larger and older GM had been watched for its symbolic importance and for the potential that the two companies could develop a broader alliance outside China. The two automakers have an agreement to develop electric cars jointly, and each has a stake in a joint-venture operating in the Indian auto market. GM's exposure to the fast-growing Chinese market and its partnership with SAIC have been major pillars of a just-completed road show for institutional investors led by Chief Executive Dan Akerson. Tim Leuliettle, a director at Visteon Corp VSTO.OB and longtime U.S. auto industry executive, said SAIC would have other opportunities to invest in GM and cement a key partnership even if it did not participate in the IPO. "They may not be in the IPO. It doesn't mean they're not going to be playing a role over time, or might not step up for the second or third tranches of equity as this goes forward," Leuliette told the Reuters Autos Summit. "But the emergence of GM from bankruptcy is such a politically sensitive event that there are other factors that would perhaps affect the decision process of those offshore that want to invest," he said. He added, "There will be plenty of time. There will be other opportunities. Let's get this one launched and off the docket and then we'll see what happens."
