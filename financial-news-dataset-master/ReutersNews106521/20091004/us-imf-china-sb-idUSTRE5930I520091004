 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - China recognizes the need to increase private consumption and should be given time to implement policies to do so, the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday. 

 Such a shift will require boosting labor's share of national income and reorienting investment, said Anoop Singh, director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department. China's roaring growth over the past decade has been powered by capital-intensive investment, with an ever-smaller portion of gains going to workers. Relatively flat wage growth has depressed consumption in China, helping to fuel the global economic imbalances that countries around the world are now trying to address. Singh said it would require a "very comprehensive strategy" to get Chinese to spend more. "The need for a shift toward private demand and private consumption is very real and very recognized in China," he said. "But we should be cautious and realistic in recognizing ourselves that this kind of transition, important as it is, will take time to implement and we need to allow that time," he told a news conference. Letting its yuan currency appreciate could be one key prong of China's rebalancing effort, as it would cut effective subsidies to exporting firms and shift more wealth to households. Group of Seven rich nations on Saturday renewed their call for China to strengthen the yuan. Forcing state-owned enterprises to pay more of their profits as dividends and curbing bank lending to capital-heavy industries are among other measures that economists think Beijing should adopt to promote income growth. China's share of wages in national income fell to 39.7 percent in 2007 from 52.8 percent a decade earlier, according to official data. As for monetary policy in the short run, Singh said that China should potentially move toward a tightening bias ahead of much of the rest of the world. "Some countries, notably China, that have been experiencing rapid credit growth may need to gradually unwind loose fiscal conditions to avoid a build-up of future problems for banking systems," he said in a statement. Chinese banks have slowed their lending pace after a record loan surge to begin this year, but officials have repeatedly insisted that they will not abandon their "appropriately loose" monetary policy until the recovery is on firmer ground. The IMF last week raised its 2010 forecast for Chinese growth to 9.0 percent from 8.5 percent, saying China, along with India, would lead Asia's expansion.
