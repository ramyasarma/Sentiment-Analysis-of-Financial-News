 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China should let the yuan float within a wider range in a gradual process over the next five years, an official at a local branch of the central bank said in comments published on Thursday. 

 Wang Yong, with the central bank's training school in Zhengzhou, Henan province, also said the People's Bank of China should scale back its intervention in the foreign exchange market so long as the yuan does not bump up against the limits imposed on its daily fluctuations. The Chinese yuan can now move within a daily range of 0.5 percent up or down from a reference rate set by the central bank, but has rarely approached those limits. It has gained only about 0.8 percent since Beijing removed the currency from a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar on June 19. The daily range should be expanded to 1 percent next year and 2 percent in 2015, Wang said in an article published in the official Shanghai Securities News. While his comments do not necessarily reflect official thinking, they do highlight a range of differing views in China about how to reform the yuan's exchange rate regime. Wang echoed the country's top leadership in saying that Beijing should resist any calls for rapid appreciation. "China should not and cannot pay for the global financial crisis, and it has no reason to act according to other people's moods," he wrote. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday said China's currency policy effectively subsidizes its exports, giving fresh ammunition to China's critics in Congress who are pushing for legislation aimed at pressuring China to act more quickly. Separately, Zhou Qiren, a central bank adviser, said China could allow its currency to depreciate against the U.S. dollar to support its exports if they are battered by the euro zone debt crisis. Although last month's resumption of yuan appreciation has dominated recent headlines, China's more seminal reform came five years ago on July 21, 2005, when Beijing lifted the currency from a formal peg to the dollar and set it on path of gradual appreciation. In an editorial to mark the anniversary, the official Xinhua news agency said that Chinese currency reform was making progress, with the exchange rate now clearly fluctuating in two directions.
