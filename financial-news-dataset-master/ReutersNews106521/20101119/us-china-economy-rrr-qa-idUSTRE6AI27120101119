 SHANGHAI/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's central bank said on Friday it was raising banks' required reserves for the second time in two weeks and the fifth time this year, as it seeks to keep inflation from gathering steam. 

 Here are some questions and answers about how markets in mainland China and Hong Kong could respond to the move when they reopen on Monday. WHITHER SHANGHAI SHARES? The Chinese stock market could actually get a lift from the news of the reserve requirement increase when it reopens on Monday, as the step to clamp down on liquidity was not as severe as the interest rate hike markets had been anticipating. The main stock index, the Shanghai Composite  .SSEC , has fallen by around 8 percent since last Friday, when it saw its biggest daily fall in over a year on renewed worries that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) would ramp up its tightening campaign. While shares could bounce a bit in the next few days of trading because even more severe tightening has already been priced in, markets are likely to remain choppy in the coming weeks, with the index likely hovering around the 250-day moving average of around 2,890 points. The stock market, in which retail investors account for around two-thirds of turnover, has been slow to respond to the central bank's latest tightening campaign, in part because of a widespread notion that U.S. monetary easing would lead to an inflow of capital, supporting the market. The market rose the day after both the mid-October interest rate rise and last week's reserve requirement increase, only to fall over 9 percent from a high hit on November 11. WILL HONG KONG SHARES RESPOND DIFFERENTLY? The Hang Seng Index  .HSI  is also likely to get support from the fact that the PBOC appears to be holding off from raising rates unless it really needs to, having priced in expectations that an interest rate hike was imminent. Some banking shares could take a hit from the impact the reserve increase will have on their lending business, if the higher reserve requirement forces them to call in some loans. For big banks, the ratio is now at 18.5 percent, a record high, tying up more funds that could otherwise be lent out. First to see the flow of credit slow could be property developers, who have already been the target of other measures to limit their ability to secure loans for projects under development. Investors could also see the RRR increase as a harbinger of more tightening, potentially weighing on Hong Kong and Chinese markets in the weeks to come. HOW SHOULD INVESTORS PLAY YUAN NDFS? Dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) are expected to tick lower, implying slightly more appreciation, but the drop is unlikely to be sustained as year-end profit taking flows are expected to keep them in a tight range at least until the end of the year. Implied yuan appreciation reflected in one-year NDFs has dropped to 2.6 percent compared with nearly 4 percent at the beginning of the month due to the dollar's rebound last week and as a broad wave of risk aversion swept across financial markets, indicating some positions are being liquidated. Looking forward, investors can now look to receive mid-range NDFs from nine months to two years compared with short-term contracts of three months, as Beijing will let the yuan appreciate at a decent but controlled pace next year, depending on which other levers it uses to tighten policy. Some traders recommend holding on to core received dollar/yuan NDF positions or buying yuan in the Hong Kong market to bet on more appreciation. In the spot market, the yuan could weaken a touch early next week, as the central bank tends to seek to fend off speculators betting on a stronger currency in the wake of the policy tightening moves. However, it should then get back onto a track of appreciating slightly by year-end. (Writing by  Jason Subler ; Additional reporting by Jun Ebias in Hong Kong; Editing by Toby Chopra)
