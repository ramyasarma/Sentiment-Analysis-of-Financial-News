 LONDON  (Reuters) - The next head of the International Monetary Fund should come from China, India or another developing economy, veteran emerging market investor Mark Mobius said on Wednesday. 

 "Definitely that should happen," Mobius, who overseas Franklin Templeton's Emerging Markets Group, said when asked about the possibility by Reuters Insider television. "They should put in a Chinese person or an Indian or somebody from the emerging market space, that would breathe fresh air into some of these multilateral institutions."  Mobius' comments come as Dominique Strauss-Kahn fac es growing pressure to quit as head of the IMF after his arrest on attempted rape charges. The battle over the IMF succession heated up when China, Brazil and South Africa challenged Europe's long-standing grip on a job that is pivotal to the world economy. China said on Tuesday the selection of the next IMF boss should be based on "fairness, transparency and merit." It marked the first time that China, the fund's third largest member, weighed in early and so publicly on an IMF selection debate. Mobius, who oversees more than $50 billion in assets, also said emerging markets should make up around 32 percent of a global equity portfolio, to represent the market capitalization of emerging markets. "Economic growth in emerging markets is doing very well, there is no reason why stock markets should not reflect this positive movement," he said. Reuters' latest poll of large institutional investors showed at least 13 percent of equity allocations were in emerging market stocks. Emerging market stocks have underperformed global markets this year, dipping 0.75 percent compared with global gains of 3.5 percent.
